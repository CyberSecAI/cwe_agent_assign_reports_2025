It has a ChildOf relationship to CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). It also has CanPrecede relationship to CWE-805 (Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe130[\"CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe805[\"CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\"]\n    \n    cwe130 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe130 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe805\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe130 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe805 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is unclear because the CVE Reference Links Content Summary is \"UNRELATED\". However, based on the key phrases, it could be as follows:\n1.  The root cause could be **Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency** (CWE-130) in Remote Desktop Services.\n2.  This could lead to **tampering** of data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the limited information, the primary weakness appears to be related to **tampering** in Windows Remote Desktop Services. The provided information does not give enough information to come to a firm conclusion.\n\nCWE-130 (Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency) is a candidate because it addresses the **improper handling** of data length which could lead to **tampering**.\nCWE-472 (External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter) is also a candidate because the **tampering** could be caused by external modification of parameters.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n*   CWE-822, CWE-1283, CWE-549, CWE-1284, CWE-250, CWE-923, CWE-912, CWE-805: These CWEs have a low individual score or no

Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**:
