CWE-359 \"Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\" and CWE-497 \"Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\" are both children of CWE-200 \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\".\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe359,cwe497 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper restriction of access to sensitive information**, leading to the **exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor.**\n- **Root Cause:** **Improper restriction of access to sensitive information.**\n- **Weakness:** **CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**.\n- **Impact:** Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor and Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-200 as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description's key phrases. The retriever results also listed CWE-200 as the top candidate.\nAlthough CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE and the guidance discourages its use, in this case, the description does not give enough information to narrow it down to a more specific Base or Variant level CWE.\nCWE-359 \"Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\" was also considered as a more specific case of CWE-200, along with CWE-497 \"Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\".\nGiven the limited information available, a combination of CWE-200 along with the more specific CWE-359 and CWE-497 is most appropriate.\nThe selection of CWE-200 is primarily based on the explicit mention of \"CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\" in the vulnerability description and key phrases.\nThe other CWEs considered were not selected because they did not directly align with the provided vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product's intended functionality exposes information to certain actors in accordance with the developer's security policy, but this information is regarded as sensitive according to the intended security policies of other stakeholders such as the product's administrator, users, or others whose information is being processed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available.

CWE-359 \"Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\" and CWE-497 \"Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\" are both children of CWE-200 \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\".\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe359,cwe497 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper restriction of access to sensitive information**, leading to the **exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor.**\n- **Root Cause:** **Improper restriction of access to sensitive information.**\n- **Weakness:** **CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**.\n- **Impact:** Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor and Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-200 as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description's key phrases. The retriever results also listed CWE-200 as the top candidate.\nAlthough CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE and the guidance discourages its use, in this case, the description does not give enough information to narrow it down to a more specific Base or Variant level CWE.\nCWE-359 \"Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\" was also considered as a more specific case of CWE-200, along with CWE-497 \"Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\".\nGiven the limited information available, a combination of CWE-200 along with the more specific CWE-359 and CWE-497 is most appropriate.\nThe selection of CWE-200 is primarily based on the explicit mention of \"CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\" in the vulnerability description and key phrases.\nThe other CWEs considered were not selected because they did not directly align with the provided vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product's intended functionality exposes information to certain actors in accordance with the developer's security policy, but this information is regarded as sensitive according to the intended security policies of other stakeholders such as the product's administrator, users, or others whose information is being processed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available.
