The **root cause** may be related to a use-after-free (CWE-416).\n2.  The **weakness** is an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) due to **improper bounds checks**.\n3.  The **impact** is that an app can corrupt coprocessor memory.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) which was addressed with improved **bounds checks**. This is supported by the vulnerability description. The CVE reference also mentions a use-after-free (CWE-416) issue. The retriever results also list CWE-787 as the top candidate.\n\nThe relationship analysis shows that CWE-787 is a specific type of memory safety issue (child of CWE-119), making it a more precise classification than the general CWE-119.
