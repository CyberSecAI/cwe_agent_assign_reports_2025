  "description": "PDF-XChange Editor RTF File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Read Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of RTF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-25473.",

The **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** leads to **read past the end of an allocated buffer** |\n| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. The root cause is the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**.|\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-125, which is a Base level CWE. CWE-20 is a Class level CWE and a parent of CWE-125, representing the **improper input validation** that leads to the out-of-bounds read. The relationship between CWE-20 and CWE-125 is a ChildOf relationship, where CWE-125 is a child of CWE-20. This indicates that **improper input validation** can lead to an out-of-bounds read.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-20), which leads to an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125), ultimately resulting in the ability to **execute arbitrary code** on the affected system.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n  - **Weakness:** CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n  - **Impact:** Remote Code Execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The key phrases \"lack of proper validation of user-supplied data\" and \"read past the end of an allocated buffer\" directly correlate to CWE-20 and CWE-125, respectively.\n\nThe relationship graph helps to understand that **improper input validation** can lead to an out-of-bounds read. CWE-125 is chosen as the primary CWE because it is a more specific description of the vulnerability than CWE-20. CWE-20 is a broader class of vulnerabilities, while CWE-125 specifically describes the out-of-bounds read condition. The retriever results also support this decision, with CWE-125 being a highly relevant CWE.\n\nThe final decision is to map the vulnerability to CWE-125 as the primary CWE, with CWE-20 as a secondary CWE to represent the root cause of the vulnerability. This provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability and its underlying cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
