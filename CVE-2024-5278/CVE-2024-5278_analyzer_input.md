# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-5278

# Vulnerability Description

    gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt is vulnerable to an ****unrestricted file upload**** vulnerability due to **insufficient validation of uploaded file types** in its `/upload` endpoint. Specifically, the `handle_file_upload` function does not sanitize or validate the file extension or content type of uploaded files, allowing attackers to upload files with arbitrary extensions, including HTML files containing **XSS** payloads and Python files. This vulnerability, present in the latest version as of 20240310, could lead to stored **XSS** attacks and potentially result in remote code execution (RCE) on the server hosting the application.
