While more specific child CWEs of CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) exist, the lack of specific details in the vulnerability description makes it difficult to select a more precise CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe209 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe532,cwe497,cwe312,cwe209 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain is simplified due to the limited information. It starts with an unspecified **weakness** leading to **Information Disclosure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis heavily relies on the vulnerability description, which indicates an **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. The primary CWE candidate is CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor), which aligns with the described impact.\n\nThe choice of CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is made despite the \"Discouraged\" usage recommendation, because of the lack of specific root cause information in the provided text. The vulnerability is described as a generic \"Information Disclosure Vulnerability,\" without details on the underlying cause. The retriever results also listed CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) with the highest similarity score. Due to the limitations, a more specific CWE cannot be confidently assigned.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available.

While more specific child CWEs of CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) exist, the lack of specific details in the vulnerability description makes it difficult to select a more precise CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe209 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe532,cwe497,cwe312,cwe209 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain is simplified due to the limited information. It starts with an unspecified **weakness** leading to **Information Disclosure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis heavily relies on the vulnerability description, which indicates an **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. The primary CWE candidate is CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor), which aligns with the described impact.\n\nThe choice of CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is made despite the \"Discouraged\" usage recommendation, because of the lack of specific root cause information in the provided text. The vulnerability is described as a generic \"Information Disclosure Vulnerability,\" without details on the underlying cause. The retriever results also listed CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) with the highest similarity score.
