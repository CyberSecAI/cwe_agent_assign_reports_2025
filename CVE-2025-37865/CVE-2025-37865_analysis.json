  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net dsa mv88e6xxx fix -ENOENT when deleting VLANs and MST is unsupported Russell King reports that on the ZII dev rev B, deleting a bridge VLAN from a user port fails with -ENOENT https//lore.kernel.org/netdev/Z_lQXNP0s5-IiJzd@shell.armlinux.org.uk/ This comes from mv88e6xxx_port_vlan_leave() -> mv88e6xxx_mst_put(), which tries to find an MST entry in &chip->msts associated with the SID, but fails and returns -ENOENT as such. But we know that this chip does not support MST at all, so that is not surprising. The question is why does the guard in mv88e6xxx_mst_put() not exit early if (!sid) return 0 And the answer seems to be simple the sid comes from vlan.sid which supposedly was previously populated by mv88e6xxx_vtu_get(). But some chip->info->ops->vtu_getnext() implementations do not populate vlan.sid, for example see mv88e6185_g1_vtu_getnext(). In that case, later in mv88e6xxx_port_vlan_leave() we are using a **garbage sid** which is just residual stack memory. Testing for sid == 0 covers all cases of a non-bridge VLAN or a bridge VLAN mapped to the default MSTI. For some chips, SID 0 is valid and installed by mv88e6xxx_stu_setup(). A chip which does not support the STU would implicitly only support mapping all VLANs to the default MSTI, so although SID 0 is not valid, it would be sufficient, if we were to zero-initialize the vlan structure, to fix the bug, due to the coincidence that a test for vlan.sid == 0 already exists and leads to the same (correct) behavior. Another option which would be sufficient would be to add a test for mv88e6xxx_has_stu() inside mv88e6xxx_mst_put(), symmetric to the one which already exists in mv88e6xxx_mst_get(). But that placement means the caller will have to dereference vlan.sid, which means it will access **uninitialized memory**, which is not nice even if it ignores it later. So we end up making both modifications, in order to not rely just on the sid == 0 coincidence, but also to avoid having uninitialized structure fields which might get temporarily accessed.",

CWE-824, **access of uninitialized pointer**, and CWE-909, **missing initialization of resource**, are related. CWE-909 can precede CWE-908 as the resource is not initialized first before being used. CWE-824 is a more specific case of CWE-908 when the uninitialized resource is a pointer. CWE-908 is a child of CWE-665 (**Improper Initialization**), indicating a general failure to initialize resources.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe908[\"CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource\"]\n    cwe824[\"CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\"]\n    cwe909[\"CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\"]\n    cwe665[\"CWE-665: Improper Initialization\"]\n\n    cwe908 -->|CHILDOF| cwe665\n    cwe824 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe909 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe908\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe908 primary\n    class cwe824,cwe909 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing initialization of a resource** (CWE-909), which leads to a **use of an uninitialized resource** (CWE-908). If the uninitialized resource is a pointer, then **access of an uninitialized pointer** (CWE-824) occurs. The final impact is an error when deleting VLANs.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **use of uninitialized memory**, specifically the `vlan.sid` field. The core issue is that some `vtu_getnext()` implementations do not populate this field, leading to the use of **garbage sid** later on. This corresponds to CWE-908 (**Use of Uninitialized Resource**), because the sid is being used while uninitialized.\n\nCWE-824 (**Access of Uninitialized Pointer**) is also relevant, since an uninitialized pointer is being accessed. However, the code doesn't show that the sid is necessarily a pointer. It is a sid that resides in `vlan.sid`. So CWE-824 is a special case of CWE-908, since the resource is not necessarily a pointer.\n\nCWE-909 (**Missing Initialization of Resource**) is also relevant, because the `vlan.sid` field is not being initialized in some cases. This is a prerequisite for CWE-908 since the resource must be missing initialization before it can be used uninitialized.\n\nThe evidence strongly suggests that the most accurate classification is CWE-908, as it directly addresses the **use of an uninitialized resource**. The other CWEs are related but represent either a prerequisite or a specific instance of this weakness.\n\nThe selection of CWE-908 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it captures the root cause without being overly specific (like focusing solely on pointers) or too general (like only addressing initialization issues).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Technical Explanation**: The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **access of uninitialized memory**, which aligns with CWE-824.
