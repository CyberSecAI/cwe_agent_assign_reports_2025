Affected by this vulnerability is the function torch.ops.profiler._call_end_callbacks_on_jit_fut of the component Tuple Handler. The manipulation of the argument None leads to memory corruption. The attack can be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult.",
