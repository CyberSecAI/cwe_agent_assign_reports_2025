# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-8455

# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-8455
## Query
The swctrl service is used to detect and remotely manage PLANET Technology devices. For certain switch models, the authentication tokens used during communication with this service are encoded user passwords. Due to insufficient strength, unauthorized remote attackers who intercept the packets can directly crack them to obtain plaintext passwords.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'insufficient strength of authentication tokens'
