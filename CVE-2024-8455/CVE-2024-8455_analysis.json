CWE-916 is a related weakness, indicating the use of a weak password hash, which can lead to the exposure of plaintext passwords. These CWEs don't have a direct hierarchical relationship but share a common goal of protecting sensitive information. The abstraction levels are both Base, indicating a good level of specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe916 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient strength of authentication tokens** which are encoded user passwords. When these tokens are transmitted, they are vulnerable to interception and cracking due to their weakness (CWE-916). This leads to the transmission of sensitive information (plaintext passwords) in cleartext (CWE-319), resulting in the exposure of user credentials.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the vulnerability is primarily due to the transmission of sensitive information in cleartext. The **insufficient strength** of the authentication tokens exacerbates the issue, making it easier for attackers to obtain plaintext passwords.\n\nCWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly states that \"authentication tokens used during communication with this service are encoded user passwords\" and that \"unauthorized remote attackers who intercept the packets can directly crack them to obtain plaintext passwords.\" This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-319, which involves transmitting sensitive data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors. The retriever results also list CWE-319 with a high score.\n\nCWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) is selected as a secondary CWE because the **insufficient strength of authentication tokens** suggests that the hashing algorithm used is weak and easily cracked. This aligns with the description of CWE-916, which involves using password hashes with insufficient computational effort, making them vulnerable to attacks.\n\nThe selection of CWE-319 and CWE-916 is based on the provided evidence and the alignment of the vulnerability description with the characteristics of these CWEs. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, providing a good level of specificity. The retriever scores also support the selection of these CWEs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
