CWE-352 is a compound weakness, suggesting it's a combination of multiple underlying issues. CWE-79 is a base weakness, representing the specific **XSS** vulnerability that results from the CSRF.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe352\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability (CWE-352). A successful CSRF attack can then lead to Stored **XSS** (CWE-79), where malicious scripts are injected and stored on the server, affecting other users. The root cause is the **CSRF** vulnerability, which allows attackers to perform actions on behalf of legitimate users, ultimately leading to the **XSS** vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability that leads to Stored **XSS**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states that the root cause is **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**.\nThe description clearly states that a **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability allows Stored **XSS**.\nBased on the retriever results, CWE-79 has a high score.
