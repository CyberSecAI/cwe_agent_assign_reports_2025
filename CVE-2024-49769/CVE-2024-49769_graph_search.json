When a remote client closes the connection before waitress has had the opportunity to call getpeername() waitress wont correctly clean up the connection leading to the main thread attempting to write to a socket that no longer exists, but not removing it from the list of sockets to attempt to process. This leads to a busy-loop calling the write function. A remote attacker could run waitress out of available sockets with very little resources required. Waitress 3.0.1 contains fixes that remove the race condition. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-605 CWE-367 CWE-667 CWE-476 CWE-362 CWE-1385 CWE-246 CWE-404 CWE-410 CWE-833",
