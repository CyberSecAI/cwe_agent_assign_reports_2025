## Vulnerability Description
CryptRandom Perl package 1.05 through 1.55 may use rand() function, which is not cryptographically strong, for cryptographic functions. If the Provider is not specified and /dev/urandom or an Entropy Gathering Daemon (egd) service is not available CryptRandom will default to use the **insecure CryptRandomrand provider**. In particular, Windows versions of perl will encounter this issue by default.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **use of rand() function**
- **weakness:** **insecure CryptRandomrand provider**
- **product:** CryptRandom Perl package
- **version:** 1.05 through 1.55
- **component:** cryptographic functions

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-1828 related content:

Based on the provided content, here's an extraction of relevant information, focusing on the commit messages and documentation related to `Crypt::Random`:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `rand` provider in `Crypt::Random` was identified as insecure for cryptographic purposes. It relied on Perl's internal `rand` function, which is not a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Use of a non-cryptographically secure random number generator (`rand`) as a default or available option.
*   Potential for predictable or biased random numbers when using the `rand` provider.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Using the insecure `rand` provider could compromise the security of applications relying on `Crypt::Random` for generating random numbers, especially in cryptographic contexts. This could lead to vulnerabilities such as:

*   Predictable keys or initialization vectors.
*   Weakened encryption.
*   Successful attacks against systems relying on randomness for security.

**Attack vectors:**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by:

*   Forcing the application to use the `rand` provider.
*   Predicting the output of the `rand` function and using this information to compromise the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

The attacker would need to be able to influence the application to use the insecure `rand` provider. This could involve:

*   Controlling the application's configuration.
*   Exploiting a vulnerability that allows them to specify the random number generator.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The following steps were taken to mitigate the vulnerability:

1.  **Switch to `Crypt::URandom`:** The `rand` provider was updated to use `Crypt::URandom::urandom` instead of Perl's internal `rand` function. This provides a more secure random number generation mechanism.
2.  **Move `rand` and `egd` to low strength list:** The `rand` and `egd` providers were moved to the low strength provider list.
3.  **Default to strong randomness:** The code now defaults to using strong randomness (using `/dev/urandom` or `Crypt::URandom::urandom`) if the `Strength` parameter is not explicitly specified.
4.  **Added Win32API Provider:** A new Win32API Provider was added for Windows.
5.  **Documentation update:** The documentation for `rand` explicitly states that it is *not* cryptographically secure and recommends using other modules for security-sensitive applications.

**Additional details:**

*   The commit messages indicate a broader effort to modernize the `Crypt::Random` module, including moving to `Dist::Zilla` for building, adding GitHub Actions for testing, and updating copyright information.
*   The perldoc.perl.org documentation for `rand` also explicitly warns against using it in security-sensitive situations and lists alternative modules for cryptographically secure random number generation.
