## Vulnerability Description
The FV Flowplayer Video Player plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **time-based SQL Injection** via the exclude parameter in all versions up to, and including, 7.5.46.7212 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
