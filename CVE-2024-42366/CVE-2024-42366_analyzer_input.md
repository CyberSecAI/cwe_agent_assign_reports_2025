# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-42366

## Vulnerability Description
VRCX is an assistant/companion application for VRChat. In versions prior to 2024.03.23, a CefSharp browser with over-permission and **cross-site scripting** via overlay notification can be combined to result in remote command execution. These vulnerabilities are patched in VRCX 2023.12.24. In addition to the patch, VRCX maintainers worked with the VRC team and blocked the older version of VRCX on the VRCs API side. Users who use the older version of VRCX must update their installation to continue using VRCX.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **cross-site scripting**
- **impact:** remote command execution
- **vector:** overlay notification
- **product:** VRCX
- **version:** prior to 2024.03.23
- **component:** CefSharp browser

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-42366:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a combination of two weaknesses:

1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Overlay Notifications:** The VRCX application displays in-game notifications in an overlay. A flaw in how these notifications are processed allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code. Specifically, VRChat log parsing issues permit attackers to spoof display names, bypassing the usual sanitization and injecting malicious code.

2.  **Over-Permissioned CefSharp Browser:** The VRCX application uses a CefSharp browser to render UI elements and expose the `AppApi` object to the browser. The `AppApi` object includes powerful methods, such as `StartGameFromPath`, that can execute arbitrary commands on the host system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XSS:** The primary vulnerability is an XSS vulnerability caused by insufficient input sanitization when processing VRChat log data used for overlay notifications.
*   **Unrestricted Command Execution:** The `StartGameFromPath` function within the `AppApi` lacks sufficient checks and allows for arbitrary command execution by providing the function with a path and arguments.
*   **Overly Permissive Javascript Bindings:**  The CefSharp browser has access to the `AppApi` object, allowing Javascript to call the function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the user's machine. By injecting malicious JavaScript via an overlay notification, an attacker can leverage the `AppApi.StartGameFromPath` function to execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to:

*   Complete control of the user's system.
*   Installation of malware.
*   Data exfiltration.
*   Other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is via malicious log data that spoofs a user's display name that is then displayed through the overlay notification. This requires a malicious user to be in the same VRChat instance as the target.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to generate VRChat logs that contain a spoofed display name.
*   The attacker must be in the same VRChat instance as the target user to trigger the crafted notification.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was patched in VRCX version 2024.03.23.
*   The VRC team also blocked older versions of VRCX on their API side to mitigate the risk.
*   The provided content identifies the specific lines of code within the application where the vulnerabilities exist.
*   The `AppApi` object is exposed to the browser, which is a security risk.
*   The `StartGameFromPath` method accepts an executable path and arguments, providing a way to execute arbitrary commands.
*   The attacker can use javascript `CefSharp.BindObjectAsync('AppApi')` to gain access to the `AppApi` object and invoke the `StartGameFromPath` method.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**
