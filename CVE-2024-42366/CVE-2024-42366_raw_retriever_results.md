VRCX is an assistant/companion application for VRChat. In versions prior to 2024.03.23, a CefSharp browser with over-permission and cross-site scripting via overlay notification can be combined to result in remote command execution. These vulnerabilities are patched in VRCX 2023.12.24. In addition to the patch, VRCX maintainers worked with the VRC team and blocked the older version of VRCX on the VRCs API side. Users who use the older version of VRCX must update their installation to continue using VRCX.
