  "description": "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to 10.11.2, providing a non-numeric length value to the random string generation utility will create a **memory issue** breaking the capability to generate random strings platform wide. This creates a denial of service situation where logged in sessions can no longer be refreshed as sessions depend on the capability to generate a random session ID. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.2.",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the random string generation utility within Directus. Specifically, providing a non-numeric value as the 'length' parameter to the `/utils/random/string` endpoint causes an issue that prevents the generation of random strings, which are essential for session management.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Lack of input validation:** The random string generation utility did not properly validate the input provided for the length parameter. It failed to handle non-numeric input, leading to a broken state.\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a malformed request with a non-numeric length parameter (e.g., `length=foo`), an attacker could trigger a state where the utility fails to produce random strings. This, in turn, breaks session refreshes and effectively locks users out of the application, causing a DoS condition.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Denial of Service:** The primary impact is a denial of service. Because Directus uses the random string generator to create session IDs, the inability to generate random strings prevents users from refreshing their sessions. This leads to an inability to authenticate and access the application.\n- **Unauthenticated DoS:** The attack can be carried out without authentication, making it easily exploitable by anyone with network access to the Directus instance.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network by sending HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.\n- **Specifically:** Sending a `GET` request to `http://<directus-instance>/utils/random/string` with a non-numeric value for the `length` parameter (e.g., `?length=foo`).\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable Directus instance.\n- **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to trigger the vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Details from the Patch:**\n- The fix implements validation using Joi to enforce that the length parameter must be an integer between 1 and 500.\n- It also ensures that a minimum length of 1 is enforced.\n- Error handling has been improved to report invalid queries and ignore unknown queries.\n- The fix also updates the GraphQL service to have similar validation on the length parameter.\n\nThe provided content gives detailed steps for reproducing the vulnerability and also details the fix implemented, thus providing more insight than the official CVE description which only mentions a \"PLACEHOLDER\".",

CWE-770 (**Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**) is a consequence of the missing input validation, leading to resource exhaustion. CWE-400 (**Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**) is the resulting impact of the resource exhaustion.\nThe abstraction levels influenced the selection, preferring the Base level CWE-1284 as it represents the **root cause** more accurately than its Class parent.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe400\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe770\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1284 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-1284 (**Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input**) - The application fails to validate that the 'length' parameter is a valid numeric value.\n2.  CWE-770 (**Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**) - The invalid input results in excessive memory allocation or other resource consumption due to the **memory issue**.\n3.  **Impact:** CWE-400 (**Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**) - This leads to a denial-of-service condition as the system's resources are exhausted.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-1284 as the primary **root cause** due to the **lack of input validation**. The provided evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly states: \"**Lack of input validation:** The random string generation utility did not properly validate the input provided for the length parameter. It failed to handle non-numeric input, leading to a broken state.\" This aligns directly with the description of CWE-1284. The subsequent **memory issue** and denial-of-service condition are consequences of this initial flaw, leading to the selection of CWE-770 and CWE-400 as secondary CWEs.\n\nThe graph relationships helped in understanding the flow of the vulnerability, starting from the **lack of validation** (CWE-1284) leading to resource allocation issues (CWE-770) and finally resulting in resource consumption (CWE-400). The selection of CWEs is based on the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-1284 being a Base level CWE that accurately represents the **root cause**.\n\n**CWEs Considered But Not Used:**\n\n*   **CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values)**, **CWE-334 (Small Space of Random Values)**, **CWE-335 (Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG))**, **CWE-337 (Predictable Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG))**, and **CWE-1204 (Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV))**: These CWEs relate to issues with random number generation, but the core issue here isn't the randomness of the generated string but the improper handling of the length parameter during the generation process. Thus, they are not directly applicable.\n*   **CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value)**: While the vulnerability leads to a **memory issue**, the primary problem is not the excessive size value itself but the **lack of validation** that causes the issue. Therefore, CWE-1284 is a more appropriate choice.\n*   **CWE-804 (Guessable CAPTCHA)**: This is specific to CAPTCHA implementations and not relevant to the described vulnerability.\n*   **CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data)**: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability doesn't involve deserialization of untrusted data.\n*   **CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data)**: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability doesn't involve sending any Sensitive Information\n*   **CWE-226 (Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse)**: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability doesn't involve any sensitive information\n*   **CWE-1391 (Use of Weak Credentials)**: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability doesn't involve weak credentials.\n*   **CWE-303 (Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm)**: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability doesn't involve issues with authentication algorithms.\n*   **CWE-346 (Origin Validation Error)**: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability doesn't involve origin validation.\n*   **CWE-204 (Observable Response Discrepancy)**: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability doesn't involve any response discrepancy.\n*   **CWE-617 (Reachable Assertion)**: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability doesn't involve any assertions.\n*    **CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer)**: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability doesn't involve sending any Sensitive Information\n*   **CWE-1286 (Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input)**: This CWE is not used because **CWE-1284** is a better fit.\n*   **CWE-755 (Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions)**: This is too generic and doesn't specifically describe the input validation issue.\n*   **CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization)**: This is not relevant as the vulnerability doesn't involve authorization issues.",
