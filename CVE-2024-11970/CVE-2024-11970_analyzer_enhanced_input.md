## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in code-projects Concert Ticket Ordering System 1.0. Affected is an unknown function of the file /tour(cor).php. The manipulation of the argument mai leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** code-projects Concert Ticket Ordering System
- **version:** 1
- **component:** /tour(cor).php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization and validation of the `mai` parameter in the `tour(cor).php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The application directly uses user-supplied input from the `mai` parameter within SQL queries without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **Comprehensive System Control:** In severe cases, attackers can potentially gain control over the entire system.
- **Service Interruption:** Attackers can disrupt services by manipulating or corrupting the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a POST request to the `tour(cor).php` file, specifically exploiting the `mai` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `tour(cor).php` file.
- No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability, making it accessible to unauthenticated users.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the "Concert Ticket Ordering System" in PHP.
- Both error-based and time-based blind SQL injection techniques can be used to exploit the vulnerability.
- The provided payloads demonstrate how to perform error-based and time-based blind SQL injection.
- The report suggests using prepared statements and parameter binding as a key mitigation technique.
