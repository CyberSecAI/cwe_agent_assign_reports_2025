# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-7340

## Vulnerability Description
The Weave server API allows remote users to fetch files from a specific directory, but due to a **lack of input validation**, it is possible to traverse and leak arbitrary files remotely. In various common scenarios, this allows a low-privileged user to assume the role of the server admin.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **lack of input validation**
- **impact:** arbitrary file traversal and leak
- **attacker:** low-privileged user
- **product:** Weave server API

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7340:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a path traversal issue in the W&B Weave server's API. Specifically, the `send_local_file` function in `weave_server.py` is vulnerable.
*   The code constructs absolute paths by joining the root directory `/` with the provided path using `pathlib.Path()`.  This does not prevent path traversal attacks.
*   The server does not properly validate user-supplied paths, allowing for directory traversal outside of the intended file access scope.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization when handling file paths. The application uses user-controlled input to construct file paths without proper validation, which allows an attacker to navigate the file system outside of the intended directory.
*   **Insecure File Access:** The `send_local_file` function provides the capability to access local files based on the provided path, which allows an attacker to exploit this traversal vulnerability and access sensitive files on the server's filesystem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:**  An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's file system by crafting malicious paths using "../" sequences.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  The extracted information indicates that accessing files like `api_keys.ibd` could allow a low-privileged user to assume the role of the server admin by obtaining sensitive credentials or configuration details.
*   **Information Leak:** Sensitive information contained within the server's files can be leaked to an unauthorized user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The vulnerability is accessible remotely through the Weave server API.
*   **HTTP Request:** A malicious HTTP request is crafted containing a path traversal sequence.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable W&B Weave server.
*   **Low-Privileged User:** According to the JFrog report, the attack can be performed by a low-privileged user. The provided curl example suggests that valid `wandb` and `wandb_sso` cookies are required which are likely obtained by a low privileged user of the system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by the JFrog Security Research Team.
*   The fix was implemented in [this commit](https://github.com/wandb/weave/pull/1657). The fix involved checking if the resolved path starts with the intended artifact path, throwing a 403 error if not.
*   The vulnerable versions are prior to 0.50.7.
*   The provided PoC curl command demonstrates how an attacker can exploit this vulnerability, leaking the contents of the `api_keys.ibd` file which resides outside of the intended file access scope.
