However, the provided vulnerability description lacks specific details to pinpoint the exact cause. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is an impact of **improper access control**, making CWE-284 a more appropriate root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe200 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control** (CWE-284) which leads to the impact of sensitive information exposure (CWE-200). The exact nature of the access control issue (e.g., missing authorization checks) is not specified in the description.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description points to **improper access control** as the root cause, leading to information disclosure. The primary choice is CWE-284 because it broadly covers access control issues when the specific cause isn't clear. CWE-200 is a secondary consideration because it represents the impact (information exposure) rather than the root cause. The evidence is limited, as the description only mentions **\"Improper access control\"** without further details. The selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity given the available information.\n\nThe retriever results show that CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) is the top candidate. CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) are also considered but require more specific evidence about the authorization mechanism. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is also listed, but it is an impact instead of the root cause. The relatively high retriever score of CWE-1230 (Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Metadata) is not applicable because the description doesn't contain any information that matches the CWE description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
