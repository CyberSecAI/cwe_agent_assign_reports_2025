  "description": "A vulnerability in the update process of Docker Desktop for Windows versions prior to 4.41.0 could allow a local, low-privileged attacker to escalate privileges to SYSTEM. During an update, Docker Desktop attempts to delete files and subdirectories under the path C\\\\ProgramData\\\\Docker\\\\config with high privileges. However, this directory often does not exist by default, and C\\\\ProgramData\\\\ allows normal users to create new directories. By creating a malicious Docker\\\\config folder structure at this location, an attacker can force the privileged update process to delete or manipulate arbitrary system files, leading to Elevation of Privilege.",

  "reference_content": "CVE-2025-3224: PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval\n\nThe provided content details multiple techniques for escalating privileges and causing denial-of-service on Windows systems, stemming from seemingly low-impact filesystem-based vulnerabilities. It does *not* directly relate to a specific CVE with a defined description (as the CVE ID is a placeholder). However, it references ZDI-21-965, a vulnerability report from 2021, and ZDI-22-049 from 2021.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant information extracted from the text:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary File/Folder Deletes:** The core premise is leveraging the ability to delete arbitrary files or folders with SYSTEM privileges.  The vulnerabilities discussed often involve finding scenarios where deleting specific files or folders leads to unintended consequences.\n*   **Windows Installer Transactionality:** The Windows Installer service's mechanism for maintaining system integrity during installations (creating rollback files in `C:\\Config.Msi`) is exploited.  Specifically, the ability to manipulate files in `C:\\Config.Msi` after the installer has completed (or partially completed) an operation.\n*   **Oplocks:** Exploiting oplocks (opportunistic locks) to trigger actions when a file is accessed for deletion.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Insufficient DACL protection on `C:\\Config.Msi`:** While the Windows Installer attempts to protect `C:\\Config.Msi` with strong DACLs, an attacker with an arbitrary folder delete can bypass this by deleting and recreating the folder with weaker permissions.\n*   **Trust of Registry Key:** The Windows Installer trusts the `C:\\Config.Msi` folder based on the presence of a registry key, even after the folder has been recreated with malicious content.\n*   **File Handling During Uninstall:** The Windows Installer moves files to `C:\\Config.Msi` during uninstall instead of deleting them directly, creating an opportunity to manipulate the rollback process.\n*   **Vulnerable Scheduled Task (SilentCleanup):** A scheduled task that deletes files from a temp folder can be tricked into deleting critical system files through the use of symlinks and oplocks.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Privilege Escalation (EoP):**  The primary impact is escalating privileges to SYSTEM level, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the highest level of access.\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Creating a folder named `cng.sys` prevents the system from booting.\n*   **Arbitrary System Changes:** Manipulating files in `C:\\Config.Msi` allows an attacker to make arbitrary changes to the system during rollback.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary File Delete:**  A vulnerability allowing an attacker to delete arbitrary files as SYSTEM or an administrator.\n*   **Arbitrary Folder Delete/Move/Rename:** A vulnerability allowing an attacker to delete, move, or rename arbitrary folders as SYSTEM or an administrator.\n*   **Arbitrary Folder Create:** A vulnerability allowing an attacker to create arbitrary folders as SYSTEM or an administrator.\n*   **Arbitrary File Contents Delete:** A vulnerability allowing an attacker to delete the contents of an arbitrary folder as SYSTEM or an administrator.\n*   **Oplock Manipulation:** Triggering oplocks on files to execute code during file access attempts.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **SYSTEM or Administrator Privileges:** Most of the exploits require the attacker to initially have SYSTEM or administrator privileges, or a vulnerability that allows them to achieve these privileges.\n*   **Ability to Trigger File/Folder Operations:** The attacker needs a vulnerability that allows them to trigger the arbitrary file/folder operations (delete, create, etc.).\n*   **Knowledge of Windows Internals:** Understanding the Windows Installer service, NTFS file system, and oplocks is crucial for successful exploitation.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe document does not provide specific mitigations or fixes. It implies that addressing the underlying vulnerabilities that allow arbitrary file/folder operations is the primary mitigation strategy.  Strengthening DACL protection on critical system folders and validating registry key integrity are also suggested as potential improvements.\n\n\n\n**Note:** This content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description would. It's a research blog post detailing exploit techniques, not a formal vulnerability report.",

Several related CWEs were considered, including CWE-59, CWE-266, CWE-250, and CWE-367. CWE-59 (Improper Link Resolution Before File Access) is related because the attacker creates a directory structure, potentially using symbolic links or similar techniques, to manipulate the file deletion process. CWE-367 is relevant because the attacker exploits a race condition by creating the directory structure between the time the update process checks for the directory's existence and when it attempts to delete files within it. CWE-266 and CWE-250 are related due to the privilege escalation to SYSTEM. The update process runs with elevated privileges (CWE-250), and the attacker exploits the incorrect privilege assignment (CWE-266) to delete arbitrary system files.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe59[\"CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access\"]\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe250[\"CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges\"]\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n\n    cwe59 -->|PEEROF| cwe732\n    cwe266 -->|PEEROF| cwe732\n    cwe250 -->|PEEROF| cwe732\n    cwe367 -->|PEEROF| cwe732\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe732 primary\n    class cwe59,cwe266, cwe250, cwe367 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect permission assignment** for the `C:\\ProgramData\\Docker\\config` directory (CWE-732). Because this directory often doesn't exist by default, a low-privileged attacker can create it. The privileged update process then attempts to delete files and subdirectories within this attacker-controlled directory. This leads to the **execution with unnecessary privileges** (CWE-250) during the update process. If the attacker creates a malicious directory structure, this can result in arbitrary file deletion and privilege escalation. A **time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition** (CWE-367) could also exist, where the attacker creates the directory after the update process checks for its existence but before it attempts to delete files. The use of symlinks may lead to **improper link resolution** (CWE-59). Finally, the **incorrect privilege assignment** (CWE-266) during the update process allows the attacker to escalate privileges to SYSTEM.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference links. The primary weakness is the **incorrect permission assignment** (CWE-732) for the `C:\\ProgramData\\Docker\\config` directory, allowing a low-privileged attacker to create it. The update process then attempts to delete files and subdirectories with elevated privileges, leading to arbitrary file deletion and privilege escalation.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection of secondary CWEs, such as CWE-59, CWE-266, CWE-250, and CWE-367, which are related to the primary weakness.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-732 accurately represents the root cause of the vulnerability, while CWE-59, CWE-266, CWE-250, and CWE-367 describe related weaknesses that contribute to the overall vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
