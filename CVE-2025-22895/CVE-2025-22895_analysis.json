CWE-497 is related to CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor], which is a Class level CWE and a parent of CWE-497. Since the vulnerability specifically involves system information and the description specifies local access, CWE-497 is more appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe497 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **exposure of sensitive system information**, leading to the **impact** of information disclosure to an unauthorized actor.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The **weakness** is the **exposure of sensitive information**, which leads to the **impact** of information disclosure. The retriever results listed CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] as the top candidate, but it is a Class-level CWE and is generally discouraged unless a more specific CWE is not available. CWE-497 [Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere] is a Base level CWE and is more specific, as it involves the **exposure of sensitive system information**. Given the nature of the vulnerability, which involves the Edge Orchestrator software, it is reasonable to assume that the exposed information is system-related. The evidence clearly states \"Exposure of sensitive information\", which aligns with the characteristics of CWE-497. Therefore, CWE-497 is the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].",
