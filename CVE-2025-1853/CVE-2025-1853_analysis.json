This indicates a specific type of buffer overflow occurring on the stack. The hierarchical relationship confirms that CWE-121 provides a more detailed and accurate description of the vulnerability than its parent.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a **stack-based buffer overflow** (CWE-121) due to the manipulation of the argument list. The chain starts with the improper handling of input leading to memory corruption.\n  - Root cause: CWE-121 **Stack-based Buffer Overflow**\n  - Impact: Memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a **stack-based buffer overflow** due to manipulation of the argument list. This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-121 \"A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack\". The retriever results also list CWE-121 as a strong candidate.\n\nCWE-119 is a more general class that describes improper restrictions of operations within memory buffers.
