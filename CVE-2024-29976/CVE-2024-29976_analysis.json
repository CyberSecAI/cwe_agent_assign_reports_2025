This session information contains cookies, allowing the attacker to potentially impersonate an administrator and compromise the device.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment based on the provided evidence indicates that the **root cause** of the vulnerability is **improper privilege management**. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section identifies \"**improper privilege management**\" as the root cause. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section further supports this by stating, \"**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** - Improper privilege management in the `/cmd,/ck6fup6/system_main/show_allsessions` command.\"\n\nThe CWE guidance directs us to consider CWE-266, CWE-250, CWE-284, and CWE-285 for privilege-related issues. Given the vulnerability description, the system assigns incorrect privileges to a user and also exposes sensitive session information.\n\nCWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) is the most appropriate primary CWE because the **improper privilege management** allows an authenticated attacker to obtain administrator session information. The guidance provided specifically calls out CWE-266 as a good fit for misconfigured roles.
