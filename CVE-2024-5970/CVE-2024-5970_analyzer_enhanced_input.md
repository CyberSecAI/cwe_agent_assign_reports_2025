## Vulnerability Description
The MaxGalleria plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugins maxgallery_thumb shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.4 due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes**.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5970:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes in the `maxgallery_thumb` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages, which are then executed when a user accesses the page containing the malicious shortcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation leads to the execution of attacker-controlled JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Account Takeover:** Attackers could use XSS to steal session cookies, potentially leading to account hijacking.
*   **Malicious Actions:** Attackers could redirect users to malicious websites, deface the website, or perform other actions using injected scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** The attacker injects malicious code through the `maxgallery_thumb` shortcode attributes (specifically within `size`, `width`, `height`, `url` or `target` attributes).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a WordPress user with at least "contributor" level access.
*   **Content Creation:** The attacker must be able to create or edit content (posts or pages) where they can insert the malicious shortcode.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `maxgalleria-shortcode-thumb.php`, specifically around lines 45 where attributes are sanitized. The Wordfence article explicitly refers to this line in the Trac code link provided.
*   The fix involves updating the plugin to version 6.4.5 or later.
*   The vulnerability is rated as medium severity with a CVSS score of 6.4.
*   The `extract()` function in the `maxgallery_thumb_shortcode` function allows for injection of crafted payloads via shortcode attributes that are later output without proper escaping in the `get_output()` function.
