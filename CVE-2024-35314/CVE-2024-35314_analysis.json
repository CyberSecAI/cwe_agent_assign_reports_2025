CWE-88 is related to CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')) as a child. The relationship indicates that command injection can occur due to improper handling of argument delimiters. Selecting CWE-88 provides a more specific classification of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe88[\"CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe88 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe88 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe78 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient parameter sanitization** (CWE not directly mapped as it is an abstract description), leading to argument injection (CWE-88), which then allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts, resulting in a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which clearly states that the vulnerability is due to **insufficient parameter sanitization**, leading to a **command injection** attack. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary provides further evidence, stating that the root cause is an argument injection vulnerability due to **insufficient parameter sanitization**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-88 is based on the fact that the vulnerability specifically involves the improper handling of argument delimiters, making it a more precise classification than CWE-77. Although CWE-77 is a Class level CWE, the evidence supports a more specific Base level CWE.\n\nThe choice of CWE-88 is supported by the evidence in the vulnerability description and the retriever results, which suggest considering argument injection-related CWEs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
