### 3. CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element (Score: 346.29)

The product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors....

### 4. CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison (Score: 297.24)

The product compares two entities in a security-relevant context, but the comparison is incorrect, which may lead to resultant weaknesses....
