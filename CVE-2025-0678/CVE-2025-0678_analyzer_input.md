# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-0678

## Vulnerability Description
A flaw was found in grub2. When reading data from a squash4 filesystem, grubs squash4 fs module uses user-controlled parameters from the filesystem geometry to determine the internal buffer size, however, it improperly checks for **integer overflows**. A maliciously crafted filesystem may lead some of those buffer size calculations to overflow, causing it to perform a grub_malloc() operation with a smaller size than expected. As a result, the direct_read() will perform a **heap based out-of-bounds write** during data reading. This flaw may be leveraged to corrupt grubs internal critical data and may result in arbitrary code execution, by-passing secure boot protections.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** squash4 fs module
- **rootcause:** **integer overflows**
- **vector:** maliciously crafted filesystem
- **weakness:** **heap based out-of-bounds write**
- **product:** grub2
- **impact:** arbitrary code execution, by-passing secure boot protections

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-0678 based on provided content:

The provided content is directly related to CVE-2025-0678. It's a Red Hat Bugzilla report specifically referencing the CVE. Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the content:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The grub2's squash4 fs module uses user-controlled parameters from the filesystem geometry to determine internal buffer sizes without proper integer overflow checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Integer overflow in buffer size calculation within the squash4 filesystem module of grub2.
*   Heap-based out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Corruption of grub's internal critical data.
*   Potential arbitrary code execution, bypassing secure boot protections.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Maliciously crafted squash4 filesystem.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Ability to create/modify a squash4 filesystem image.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Not specified in this bug report excerpt.

**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability occurs during the `direct_read()` operation due to the overflow leading to a `grub_malloc()` call with an undersized buffer.
*   The bug report includes timestamps for reporting and modification, as well as assignee and other metadata.
*   The bug was reported by OSIDB Bzimport.
*   Priority is medium and Severity is medium.
