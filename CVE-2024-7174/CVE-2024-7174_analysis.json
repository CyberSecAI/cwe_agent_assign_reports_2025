  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in TOTOLINK A3600R 4.1.2cu.5182_B20201102. This affects the function setdeviceName of the file /cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi. The manipulation of the argument deviceMac/deviceName leads to **buffer overflow**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The associated identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-272595. NOTE The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in TOTOLINK A3600R router firmware. Here's a breakdown:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- The `setDeviceName` function in the A3600R firmware is vulnerable due to insufficient input sanitization. Specifically, the `deviceMac` and `deviceName` parameters received from POST requests are not properly validated before being used in a `system` call, which can execute arbitrary commands.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Buffer Overflow:** The initial description in the VulDB submission mentions a buffer overflow in the `deviceMac` and `deviceName` parameters. The github description focuses more on the Command Injection aspect of the issue.\n- **Command Injection:** User-controlled input within the `deviceMac` and `deviceName` parameters is directly passed to the `system` function, allowing for execution of arbitrary commands.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system. This could lead to:\n    - Complete compromise of the device.\n    - Potential for data theft.\n    - Installation of malware.\n    - Use of the router in botnet.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- A crafted POST request to the `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint with malicious input in the `deviceName` and `deviceMac` parameters.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- Network access to the vulnerable router.\n- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router.\n- No mention of Authentication in the details, suggesting it might not be required, or it can be bypassed.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The provided proof-of-concept (POC) code demonstrates how to exploit the command injection vulnerability by including shell commands in the `deviceName` parameter.\n- The vulnerability is located in `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi`\n- The vulnerable firmware version is A3600R V4.1.2cu.5182\\_B20201102.\n- The vulnerability is in the `setDeviceName` function.",

CWE-120 is a more specific case of CWE-119, and the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"buffer overflow\" due to manipulation of input arguments without proper size checks.\nThe other relationship is that of CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command) which is a peer of CWE-120. The content summary mentions that the `deviceMac` and `deviceName` parameters received from POST requests are not properly validated before being used in a `system` call, which can execute arbitrary commands.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe78 -->|PEEROF| cwe120\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe120 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe78 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **buffer overflow** (CWE-120) due to the lack of input validation when copying data into a buffer. This can potentially lead to command injection (CWE-78) if the overflow overwrites parts of the program's memory that control command execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial vulnerability description mentions a **buffer overflow**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary describes a lack of input sanitization and the ability to execute arbitrary commands via a `system` call. The Retriever Results suggest CWE-119, CWE-120, and CWE-78.\nThe selection of CWE-120 is based on the explicit mention of \"buffer overflow\" in the initial description and the detailed explanation in the content summary about the insufficient input sanitization when setting the device name, which leads to a buffer overflow when the size is not checked.\nCWE-78 is considered a secondary weakness as the **buffer overflow** vulnerability could be leveraged to inject arbitrary commands.\nCWE-120 is at the Base level, which is the most appropriate level of abstraction as it accurately represents the specific weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
