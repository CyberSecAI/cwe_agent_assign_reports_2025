# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-27100

## Description

lakeFS is an open-source tool that transforms your object storage into a Git-like repository. In affected versions an authenticated user can crash lakeFS by exhausting server memory. This is an authenticated denial-of-service issue. This problem has been patched in version 1.50.0. Users on versions 1.49.1 and below are affected. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should either set the environment variable `LAKEFS_BLOCKSTORE_S3_DISABLE_PRE_SIGNED_MULTIPART` to `true` or configure the `disable_pre_signed_multipart` key to true in their config yaml.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Product:** lakeFS
- **Impact:** denial of service, exhausting server memory
- **Attacker:** authenticated user
- **Version:** 1.49.1 and below

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-770 | Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The product allocates resources without limits, leading to denial of service. |
| CWE-789 | Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate: The vulnerability involves exhausting server memory, which suggests excessive memory allocation might be the underlying cause. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-770 [Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling], is a base CWE that has a parent-child relationship with CWE-400 [Uncontrolled Resource Consumption] and CWE-789 [Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value]. CWE-789 is a more specific variant of CWE-770, focusing specifically on memory allocation. Because the vulnerability description mentions memory exhaustion, CWE-789 is considered as a secondary candidate. However, the root cause is likely the **lack of limits** on resource allocation (CWE-770) which then leads to excessive memory allocation as a consequence (CWE-789).

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of resource limits** (CWE-770), leading to excessive memory allocation, ultimately resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

CWE-770 (Root Cause: **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**) -> CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) -> Denial of Service (Impact).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the denial-of-service vulnerability in lakeFS. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE summary clearly indicates that an authenticated user can exhaust server memory, leading to a crash. The primary CWE, CWE-770 [Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling], accurately represents the underlying issue of the **lack of proper resource management**. While CWE-789 [Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value] is a relevant secondary consideration due to the memory exhaustion aspect, CWE-770 captures the broader problem of unbounded resource allocation that leads to the memory issue.

The graph relationships highlight that CWE-789 is a child of CWE-770, indicating a more specific manifestation of the general resource management problem. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-770 directly addresses the root cause, while CWE-789 provides additional context about the specific resource being exhausted (memory).
