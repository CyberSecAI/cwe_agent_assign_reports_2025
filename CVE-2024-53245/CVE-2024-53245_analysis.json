Low-privileged user can see the dashboard name and the dashboard XML by cloning the dashboard due to the username collision with a role name that has read access to the dashboard.\n- **Impact of exploitation**: Low-privileged user can gain access to dashboard names and their XML configurations, which could reveal sensitive information, such as queries, data sources, or visualization techniques used in the dashboard.\n- **Attack vectors**: Network. An attacker can perform the attack remotely if they have access to the affected Splunk instance with Splunk Web enabled and a valid low-privilege user account that matches a role name.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs a low-privileged user account within the affected Splunk instance and the account username should match a role name that has read access to the dashboard. The user should not have admin or power roles.",

The **incorrect permission assignment** is the root cause that allows the low-privileged user to access the dashboard information. |\n| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. The **exposure of sensitive information** is a consequence of the incorrect permission assignment. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced my decision was the hierarchical relationship between CWE-732 and its potential child CWEs, as well as its relationship to CWE-200. While CWE-732 is a Class-level CWE, it appropriately captures the **incorrect permission assignment** that leads to the vulnerability. CWE-200, while relevant as an impact, is discouraged as a primary mapping due to its high-level nature.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe942[\"CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n\n    cwe942 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe732 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe732 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe863, cwe425, cwe942 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect permission assignment** (CWE-732), where a low-privileged user with a username matching a role name gains unintended read access to dashboards. This leads to the **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200), allowing the user to see the dashboard name and XML configuration.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nMy assessment is based on the provided vulnerability description and the supporting information in the CVE reference links. The core issue is that a low-privileged user is able to access dashboard information due to a username collision with a role that has read access.\n\nThe relationship graph highlights that CWE-732 can lead to CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information), which aligns with the vulnerability's impact.\n\nCWE-732 is chosen as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **root cause** which is the **incorrect assignment of permissions** for a critical resource (the dashboard). While CWE-200 is a valid representation of the impact, it is too high-level for a root cause analysis.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
