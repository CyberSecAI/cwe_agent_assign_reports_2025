  "description": "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 11.2.0, when sharing an item, a typical user can specify an arbitrary role. It allows the user to use a higher-privileged role to see fields that otherwise the user should not be able to see. Instances that are impacted are those that use the share feature and have specific roles hierarchy and fields that are not visible for certain roles. Version 11.2.0 contains a patch the issue.",

Specifically, it states that a user can specify an arbitrary role when sharing an item, which allows them to access fields they would not normally be able to see. This is a **privilege escalation** vulnerability.\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper authorization checks when sharing items. The system does not restrict the ability of a user to specify a role with higher privileges.\n\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:\n    *   Improper Access Control (CWE-269)\n    *   The share feature allows users to specify an arbitrary role, granting unauthorized access to data.\n\n*   **Impact of exploitation**:\n    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data/fields.\n    *   Privilege escalation.\n\n*   **Attack vectors**:\n    *   An authenticated user with the ability to use the share feature can create a share with a higher-privileged role, potentially exposing sensitive information.\n\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:\n    *   An authenticated user with permission to use the share feature.\n    *   Knowledge of the Directus application and its data model.\n\n*   **Mitigation or fix**:\n    *   The provided content mentions that the vulnerability is fixed in version 11.2.0. The fix involves the following:\n        *   Properly give out read permissions on access through a share\n        *   Scope the permissions to only what the user who created it has access to instead of selecting a role\n        *   Fix app hydration on shares\n        *   The content suggests that specifying a role on share should be available only for admins.\n```",

CWE-863 is a Class-level CWE, and there might be more specific Base-level children. The vulnerability description highlights an **incorrect authorization** mechanism where users can access data they should not have access to, pointing towards authorization issues.

The core of the vulnerability lies in the **incorrect authorization** checks performed when sharing items. The system **fails** to restrict users from specifying roles with higher privileges, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data. CWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, is the most appropriate primary CWE as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability. The selection of CWE-201 is based on the fact that the result of the **incorrect authorization** is the exposure of sensitive information.
