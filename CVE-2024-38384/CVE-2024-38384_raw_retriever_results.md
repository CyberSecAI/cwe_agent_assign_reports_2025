# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-38384
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved blk-cgroup fix list corruption from reorder of WRITE ->lqueued __blkcg_rstat_flush() can be run anytime, especially when blk_cgroup_bio_start is being executed. If WRITE of `->lqueued` is re-ordered with READ of bisc->lnode.next in the loop of __blkcg_rstat_flush(), `next_bisc` can be assigned with one stat instance being added in blk_cgroup_bio_start(), then the local list in __blkcg_rstat_flush() could be corrupted. Fix the issue by adding one barrier.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'reorder of WRITE ->lqueued __blkcg_rstat_flush() can be run anytime'
