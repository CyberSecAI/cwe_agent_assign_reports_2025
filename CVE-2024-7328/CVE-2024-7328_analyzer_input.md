## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper access controls in YouDianCMS 7, specifically related to the `t.php` and `upload/t.php` files. These files are accessible without proper authentication or authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Accessing `/t.php` or `/upload/t.php` reveals sensitive information, including the web server's root directory path.
*   **PHPinfo Exposure:**  The `/t.php?action=phpinfo` path enables access to the PHPinfo page, which discloses a wealth of server configuration details. This includes the PHP version, server information, environment variables, loaded modules, and potentially other sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Leakage:** Exposure of the root directory and detailed server configurations can provide attackers with crucial information for planning further attacks.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Attackers can leverage the detailed server information disclosed through PHPinfo to identify vulnerabilities in the server software or specific modules, paving the way for more sophisticated attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Access:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by directly accessing the vulnerable URLs (`/t.php`, `/upload/t.php`, and `/t.php?action=phpinfo`) via a web browser or other HTTP client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable YouDianCMS instance.
*   **No authentication required:**  The vulnerability can be exploited without any authentication or authorization.

**Summary of Information:**

The provided content details an information disclosure vulnerability in YouDianCMS 7, where accessing specific files (`/t.php` or `/upload/t.php`) leaks the server's root directory, and the `phpinfo` functionality is accessible via `/t.php?action=phpinfo`, exposing a wide range of sensitive server configuration data, which can aid attackers in planning further attacks.
