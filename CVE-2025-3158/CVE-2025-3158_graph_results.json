  "query": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. Affected by this issue is the function AssimpLWOAnimResolverUpdateAnimRangeSetup of the file code/AssetLib/LWO/LWOAnimation.cpp of the component LWO File Handler. The manipulation leads to heap-based buffer overflow. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",
