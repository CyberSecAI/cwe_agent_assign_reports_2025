Authenticated users can **inject payloads** while querying Search Template Dashboard. These are executed, leading to **Server-Side Template Injection**.', key_phrases={'rootcause': '', 'weakness': ['Server-Side Template Injection', 'inject payloads'], 'impact': '', 'vector': 'querying Search Template Dashboard', 'attacker': 'authenticated users', 'product': 'Logpoint', 'version': 'before 7.5.0', 'component': ''}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\n- The vulnerability is due to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in the Search Template Dashboard queries. Authenticated users can inject payloads that are then executed by the server-side template engine.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n-  Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability. This means that user input is being improperly handled when constructing templates on the server.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n- Successful exploitation can lead to execution of arbitrary code on the server. The impact is classified as having High Confidentiality impact, Low Integrity and Availability impacts as specified by CVSSv4.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n- The attack vector is through the Search Template Dashboard queries, where authenticated users can inject malicious payloads.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Logpoint system.\\n- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Search Template Dashboard query functionality.\\n\\n**Additional Information:**\\n- The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2024-56087 and is associated with CWE-1336.\\n- The affected product is Logpoint versions prior to 7.5.0.\\n- The vulnerability was reported by Mehmet D. Ince from Prodaft.\\n- The solution is to upgrade to Logpoint version 7.5.0.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {95: {'cwe_counts': defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {}), 'total_samples': 1,
