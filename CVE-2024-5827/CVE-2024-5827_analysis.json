The application is vulnerable to SQL injection. |\n| CWE-98 | Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion') | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary. The injection allows for writing PHP files, and this can lead to command execution through file inclusion. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-89, which can lead to other weaknesses. In this case, it allows the attacker to write arbitrary files on the file system. The ability to write PHP files, in particular, can be exploited to include and execute arbitrary code, which is described by CWE-98.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe98[\"CWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion')\"]\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe89 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe98\n    cwe98 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe78\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe98 secondary\n    class cwe78 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **SQL injection** (CWE-89). This allows the attacker to write arbitrary files. If a PHP file is written, then it can be included to achieve remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is caused by **SQL injection** (CWE-89) which allows attackers to write arbitrary files on the victims file system, such as backdoor.php.\nThe evidence is provided in the vulnerability description itself, which states: \"Vanna v0.3.4 is vulnerable to **SQL injection** in its DuckDB integration exposed to its Flask Web APIs. Attackers can inject malicious SQL training data and generate corresponding queries to write arbitrary files on the victims file system, such as backdoor.php with contents ``. This can lead to command execution or the creation of backdoors.\"\nThe fact that the injected SQL allows writing files means we should consider how the written files are used. In this case a backdoor.php file is written with PHP code. This means that a PHP file include vulnerability, such as CWE-98, is possible.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
