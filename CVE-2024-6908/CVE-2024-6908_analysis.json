This includes both creating a user as SuperAdmin, or changing an existing user's role to SuperAdmin.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Improper authorization.\n- Lack of validation for user role creation and modification.\n- Ability for users with admin privileges to escalate to super admin privileges.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- An attacker with admin privileges can gain complete control over the system by escalating their privileges to SuperAdmin.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Manual PUT requests with crafted payloads, specifically targeting user creation or role modification endpoints.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- Attacker requires existing admin level privileges.",
