  "description": "There exists a heap buffer overflow vulnerable in Abseil-cpp. The sized constructors, reserve(), and rehash() methods of absl{flat,node}hash{set,map} did not impose an upper bound on their size argument. As a result, it was possible for a caller to pass a very large size that would cause an **integer overflow** when computing the size of the containers backing store, and a subsequent out-of-bounds memory write. Subsequent accesses to the container might also access out-of-bounds memory. We recommend upgrading past commit 5a0e2cb5e3958dd90bb8569a2766622cb74d90c1",

Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe `sized constructors, reserve(), and rehash() methods of absl::{flat,node}hash{set,map}` did not impose an upper bound on their size argument. This allowed a caller to pass a very large size, leading to an integer overflow when calculating the backing store size.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Heap buffer overflow\n*   Integer overflow\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Out-of-bounds memory write\n*   Potential for subsequent out-of-bounds memory access.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Passing a very large size argument to the `sized constructors, reserve(), and rehash()` methods.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is likely difficult to exploit because container sizes are rarely attacker-controlled.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The fix involves:\n    1.  Updating `max_size()` to return the maximum number of items that can be stored in the container.\n    2.  Validating the size arguments to the constructors, `reserve()`, and `rehash()` methods, and aborting the program when the argument is invalid.\n*   Debian 11 bullseye has been patched with version `0~20200923.3-2+deb11u1`.\n*   Upgrading `abseil` packages is recommended.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The bug was discovered by Dmitry Vyukov <dvyukov@google.com>.\n*   The vulnerability is present in `absl::{flat,node}hash{set,map}`.\n*   The Debian advisory is DLA-4116-1.\n*   The Debian bug number is 1098903.\n*   The vulnerability is considered difficult to exploit in practice.\n*   The fix includes a `HashTableSizeOverflow()` function that is called when an invalid size is detected.\n*   Test cases have been added to verify the fix.",

The integer overflow is the root cause that enables the heap buffer overflow. CWE-122 (**CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow**) is a consequence of the **integer overflow**, because it is triggered by the **integer overflow** during memory allocation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe122\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe122 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) when calculating the size of the container's backing store. This leads to a smaller-than-expected memory allocation. Subsequent out-of-bounds memory writes (CWE-122) occur due to this incorrect size calculation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-190 (**CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound**) as the primary root cause, which led to CWE-122 (**CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow**). The evidence supports the selection of CWE-190 as the root cause because the **integer overflow** is the direct cause of the incorrect memory allocation. The subsequent **out-of-bounds memory write** is a direct consequence of the **heap buffer overflow** caused by the **integer overflow**.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"As a result, it was possible for a caller to pass a very large size that would cause an **integer overflow** when computing the size of the containers backing store, and a subsequent **out-of-bounds memory write**.\"\n\nThe graph relationships support the selection of CWE-190 as the primary cause and CWE-122 as the secondary effect. The **integer overflow** directly leads to the buffer overflow.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the **root cause** (CWE-190) and the immediate consequence (CWE-122) of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
