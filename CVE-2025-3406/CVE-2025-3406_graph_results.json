  "query": "A vulnerability was found in Nothings stb up to f056911. It has been classified as problematic. Affected is the function stbhw_build_tileset_from_image of the component Header Array Handler. The manipulation of the argument w leads to out-of-bounds read. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. This product is using a rolling release to provide continious delivery. Therefore, no version details for affected nor updated releases are available. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
