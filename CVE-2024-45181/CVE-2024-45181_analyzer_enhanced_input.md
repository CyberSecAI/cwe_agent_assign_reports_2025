## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45181:

**CVE-2024-45181 Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper buffer bounds check in the WibuKey driver (specifically `WibuKey32.sys` and `WibuKey64.sys`).
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer. This allows for specially crafted calls to the driver to write data to arbitrary memory addresses, leading to kernel memory corruption.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Kernel memory corruption, which could lead to a system crash (Denial of Service).
    *   The potential for other malicious activities due to the arbitrary memory write.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability. It cannot be exploited remotely over a network.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs local access to a system with the vulnerable WibuKey driver installed.
    *   The attacker also needs the ability to make specially crafted calls to the vulnerable driver.
* **Affected Products:**
    * WibuKey versions prior to 6.70 for Windows.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Upgrade to WibuKey version 6.70 or later.
    *   Restrict local access to systems with the vulnerable driver.
    *   If using a Windows server as a WibuKey network license server, consider switching to Linux or macOS.
*   **CVSS Score:**
    *   CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 8.8 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)
    *   CVSS v4.0 Base Score: 9.3 (CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H)

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory clearly states that the vulnerability is specific to the legacy WibuKey product and does not affect the successor product, CodeMeter.
*   The advisory acknowledges Team "우리 오늘부터 0-day" for reporting this vulnerability.
