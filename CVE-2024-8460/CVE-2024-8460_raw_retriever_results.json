  "query": "A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in D-Link DNS-320 2.02b01. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /cgi-bin/widget_api.cgi of the component Web Management Interface. The manipulation of the argument getHD/getSer/getSys leads to information disclosure. The attack may be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. NOTE This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. Vendor was contacted early and confirmed that the product is end-of-life. It should be retired and replaced.",
