CWE-285, Improper Authorization, is a class-level CWE. The retriever results also suggested more specific CWEs like CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). However, the provided vulnerability description only mentions \"Improper Authorization\" without specifying whether the authorization check was incorrect or missing. Therefore, the more general CWE-285 is appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe200 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Improper Authorization** (CWE-285), which leads to a security feature bypass, allowing a low-privileged attacker to view and edit low-sensitivity information. This can potentially lead to Exposure of Sensitive Information (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **Improper Authorization** as the root cause of the vulnerability, aligning with the provided description. The retriever results suggested more specific authorization-related CWEs, but the lack of detail in the description makes CWE-285 the most appropriate choice. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-862 and CWE-863 are children of CWE-285, but there is no indication of whether the authorization was missing or incorrect.\n\nThe assessment is heavily based on the provided evidence, specifically the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section, which explicitly states the **rootcause** as **Improper Authorization**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because the available information doesn't allow for a more granular classification. The \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section lists CWE-NVD-noinfo as the primary match, but this is not a valid CWE. The next most common CWE is CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), but without more information on whether the authorization was implemented incorrectly rather than missing, CWE-285 is a better choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1419.42\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead.

  "analysis_with_relationships": "# Summary\n| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| CWE-285 | Improper Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Primary CWE | Discouraged |\n| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.5 | Class | Secondary Candidate | Discouraged |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the CWE selection is the parent-child relationship. CWE-285, Improper Authorization, is a class-level CWE. The retriever results also suggested more specific CWEs like CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). However, the provided vulnerability description only mentions \"Improper Authorization\" without specifying whether the authorization check was incorrect or missing. Therefore, the more general CWE-285 is appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe200 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Improper Authorization** (CWE-285), which leads to a security feature bypass, allowing a low-privileged attacker to view and edit low-sensitivity information. This can potentially lead to Exposure of Sensitive Information (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **Improper Authorization** as the root cause of the vulnerability, aligning with the provided description. The retriever results suggested more specific authorization-related CWEs, but the lack of detail in the description makes CWE-285 the most appropriate choice. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-862 and CWE-863 are children of CWE-285, but there is no indication of whether the authorization was missing or incorrect.\n\nThe assessment is heavily based on the provided evidence, specifically the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section, which explicitly states the **rootcause** as **Improper Authorization**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because the available information doesn't allow for a more granular classification. The \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section lists CWE-NVD-noinfo as the primary match, but this is not a valid CWE. The next most common CWE is CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), but without more information on whether the authorization was implemented incorrectly rather than missing, CWE-285 is a better choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1419.42\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead.
