  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in EnGenius ENH1350EXT, ENS500-AC and ENS620EXT up to 20241118. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /admin/network/diag_ping6. The manipulation of the argument diag_ping6 leads to **command injection**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the `diag_ping6` interface of ENGENIUS routers. User-supplied input for the `diag_ping6` parameter is directly passed to a system command without any filtering or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n*   **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is a command injection vulnerability. By injecting shell metacharacters within the `diag_ping6` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the router's operating system.\n*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The vulnerability is caused by a missing input validation or sanitization step that prevents the injection of malicious code through the `diag_ping6` parameter.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the web server process, potentially gaining root access to the device.\n*   **Full System Control:** This level of access enables the attacker to perform various malicious actions, including but not limited to:\n    *   Data exfiltration\n    *   Installation of backdoors or malware\n    *   Denial of service attacks\n    *   Configuration changes\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be triggered using a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/cgi-bin/luci/.../admin/network/diag_ping6` endpoint.\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web interface of the vulnerable router.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated to access the router's web interface as an administrator.\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the router.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n*   **Affected Devices:** The vulnerability affects multiple ENGENIUS router models and firmware versions.\n*   **Exploitation Technique:** The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates the injection of a `curl` command within the `diag_ping6` parameter to trigger command execution.\n*   **Lua Code:** The core of the vulnerability is located within a lua script, where user input from `diag_ping6` is directly used in a system command.\n*   **Lack of Vendor Response:** The report indicates that attempts to contact the vendor have been unsuccessful.\n\nThis analysis provides a more detailed breakdown of the vulnerability than the placeholder description.",

CWE-78 is a specific type of CWE-77, focusing on OS commands. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"command injection\" but provides additional context indicating that the injection occurs within an OS command. Thus, the more specific CWE-78 was chosen.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper neutralization** of special elements in the `diag_ping6` argument.\n2.  **Weakness:** CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection').\n3.  **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution leading to potential full system control.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary clearly point to **command injection** due to a **lack of input sanitization**. The retriever results also highlighted CWE-77 and CWE-78 as top candidates.\n\nThe final decision to assign CWE-78 was driven by the explicit mention of OS commands in both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary: \"The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input...\". This, coupled with the fact that CWE-78 is a more specific child of CWE-77, made it the most appropriate choice.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the nature of the vulnerability as an OS command injection, and there are no more specific child CWEs available.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
