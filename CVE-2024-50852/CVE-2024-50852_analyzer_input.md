# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-50852

## Vulnerability Description
Tenda G3 v3.0 v15.11.0.20 was discovered to contain a **command injection** vulnerability via the formSetUSBPartitionUmount function.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **product:** Tenda G3
- **version:** v3.0 v15.11.0.20
- **component:** formSetUSBPartitionUmount function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient input validation in the `prod_system_param_valid` function within the `libcommonprod.so` library. Specifically, the function fails to filter out newline characters (`\n`), which can be used to inject arbitrary commands within the `doSystemCmd` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command injection:** The `formSetUSBPartitionUmount` function constructs a system command using user-provided input (`usbPartitionName`) without proper sanitization.
- **Insufficient input validation:** The `prod_system_param_valid` function, intended to validate user input, does not block newline characters, allowing attackers to break out of the intended command and inject their own.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary command execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the vulnerable device by injecting commands using newline characters in the `usbPartitionName` parameter.
- **Complete compromise of the device:** Successful command injection can lead to complete control of the router, allowing attackers to perform malicious activities such as data theft, denial-of-service attacks, or turning the device into a bot.
- **Potentially other vulnerabilities can be exposed:** Executing commands allows the attacker to discover more vulnerabilities on the device.
 

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request:** The attack is carried out by sending a POST request to the `/goform/umountUSBPartition` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `usbPartitionName` parameter.
- **Web interface:** The attack is conducted through the router's web interface after authenticating to the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access to the router:** The attacker needs to be on the same network or have network access to the Tenda router.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to authenticate to the router's web interface before sending the malicious request. The provided exploit example showcases this by including a login request before the exploit request.

**Additional Information:**
- The exploit uses the `\n` character to inject commands. For example, `\necho PWN!!! > /webroot/1.html\n` injects the command `echo PWN!!! > /webroot/1.html`.
- The vulnerability is present in Tenda-G3v3.0 firmware version V15.11.0.20 and potentially earlier versions.
- The provided content includes a Python script demonstrating how to exploit this vulnerability by logging into the router and sending the malicious post request.
- A suggested solution is to update the filter list of the `prod_system_param_valid` function within `libcommonprod.so` to include newline (`\n`) characters.
