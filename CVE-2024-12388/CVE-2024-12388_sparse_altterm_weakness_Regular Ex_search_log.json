  "query": "A vulnerability in binary-husky/gpt_academic version 310122f allows for a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. The application uses a regular expression to parse user input, which can take polynomial time to match certain crafted inputs. This allows an attacker to send a small malicious payload to the server, causing it to become unresponsive and unable to handle any requests from other users.",
