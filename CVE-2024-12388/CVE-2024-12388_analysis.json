  "description": "A vulnerability in binary-husky/gpt_academic version 310122f allows for a **Regular Expression Denial of Service** (ReDoS) attack. The application uses a regular expression to parse user input, which can take polynomial time to match certain crafted inputs. This allows an attacker to send a small malicious payload to the server, causing it to become unresponsive and unable to handle any requests from other users.",

This inefficiency leads to excessive CPU consumption, causing the server to become unresponsive, which ultimately results in a Denial of Service.\n\nCWE-1333 (Root Cause) -> CWE-400 (Resource Consumption/DoS Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-1333 because the **inefficient regular expression** is the direct cause of the vulnerability. The description states that the application uses a regular expression that can take polynomial time to match crafted inputs, leading to a denial-of-service condition. This aligns perfectly with CWE-1333's description of a regular expression with inefficient complexity consuming excessive CPU cycles.\n\nThe retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-1333 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-400, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, is considered as a secondary weakness because the **inefficient regular expression** leads to resource consumption and denial of service, but the root cause is the regex itself.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-185: Incorrect Regular Expression\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product specifies a regular expression in a way that causes data to be improperly matched or compared.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-625: Permissive Regular Expression\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a regular expression that does not sufficiently restrict the set of allowed values.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed -
