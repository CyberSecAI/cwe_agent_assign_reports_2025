  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-11992', description='**Absolute path traversal** vulnerability in Quick.CMS, version 6.7, the exploitation of which could allow remote users to bypass the intended restrictions and download any file if it has the appropriate permissions outside of documentroot configured on the server via the aDirFiles%5B0%5D parameter in the admin.php page. This vulnerability allows an attacker to delete files stored on the server due to a lack of proper verification of user-supplied input.', key_phrases={'rootcause': '', 'weakness': ['Absolute path traversal', 'path traversal vulnerability'], 'impact': [\"['bypass restrictions'\", \"'download any file'\", \"'delete files']\"], 'vector': 'aDirFiles%5B0%5D parameter', 'attacker': 'remote users', 'product': 'Quick.CMS', 'version': '6.7', 'component': 'admin.php page'}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**Root Cause:**\\nThe vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input in the `aDirFiles%5B0%5D` parameter on the `admin.php` page within Quick.CMS version 6.7. This allows for absolute path traversal.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\\n- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The application fails to properly restrict file path inputs, allowing an attacker to specify paths outside of the intended document root.\\n- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize the `aDirFiles%5B0%5D` parameter, allowing the inclusion of absolute file paths.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n- **Arbitrary File Download:** Remote attackers can bypass intended restrictions and download arbitrary files from the server, as long as the file has appropriate permissions.\\n- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Attackers can delete files stored on the server.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.\\n- **Parameter Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the `aDirFiles%5B0%5D` parameter in the `admin.php` page with a crafted absolute path.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- **Remote Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely.\\n- **No Authentication Required:** It appears that no authentication is required to trigger this vulnerability, as indicated by the CVSS vector.\\n\\n**Additional Details:**\\n- The vulnerability is specific to Quick.CMS version 6.7.\\n- The vulnerability is considered critical with a CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.1.\\n- The issue was discovered by Rafael Pedrero.\\n- No solution is available as of the publication date (2024-11-29).\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus':

This vulnerability allows an attacker to delete files stored on the server due to a lack of proper verification of user-supplied input.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## WEAKNESS: 'Absolute path traversal'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1.
