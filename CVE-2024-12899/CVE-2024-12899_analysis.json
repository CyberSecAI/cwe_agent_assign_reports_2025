  "description": "A vulnerability was found in 1000 Projects Attendance Tracking Management System 1.0. It has been rated as critical. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /admin/course_action.php. The manipulation of the argument course_code leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12899\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability is a SQL injection located in the `/admin/course_action.php` file of the \"Attendance Tracking Management System PHP & MySQL Project\"\n- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied input, specifically the `course_code` parameter before it is used in SQL queries.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates the `course_code` parameter into SQL queries without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the database.\n- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.\n- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data.\n- **Comprehensive System Control:** In severe cases, attackers may gain full control of the system, potentially leading to service interruption.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The primary attack vector is through the `course_code` parameter in a POST request to `/admin/course_action.php`.\n- No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.\n- No prior authentication or special privileges are required.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- **Vulnerable File:** `/admin/course_action.php`\n- **Vulnerable Parameter:** `course_code` (POST parameter)\n- **Vulnerability Type:** boolean-based blind and time-based blind SQL injection.\n- **Example Payloads:**\n    - **Boolean-based blind:** `course_code=-7876\" OR 5404=5404-- tZiD`\n    - **Time-based blind:** `course_code=SE 101\" AND (SELECT 7675 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))nIPp)-- aLbB`\n\n**Suggested Repair:**\n1.  **Use Prepared Statements and Parameter Binding:** Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection by separating SQL code from user input.\n2.  **Input Validation and Filtering:** Strictly validate and filter user input data.\n3.  **Minimize Database User Permissions:** Use database accounts with minimal necessary privileges.\n4.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.\n\nThis detailed breakdown should provide a comprehensive understanding of the SQL injection vulnerability described.",
