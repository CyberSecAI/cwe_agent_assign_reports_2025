The guidance clearly states that if a specific privilege or permission issue is identifiable, then CWE-266 should be favored over the more generic CWE-284. CWE-842, while relevant, is more about placing the user into an incorrect group.

The key phrase \"improper access control\" suggested CWE-284, but the provided guidance emphasizes using more specific CWEs when possible. The retriever results also included CWE-266 and CWE-842, which are more specific. The guidance clearly states that when the system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest), CWE-266 is appropriate. Therefore, CWE-266 is the primary CWE because the root cause is **improper privilege assignment** leading to elevation of privilege.\n\nCWE-842 was considered because it relates to placing a user in an incorrect group, which could lead to **improper access control**. However, the vulnerability description doesn't specifically mention group placement, so CWE-266 is a better fit as it directly addresses **incorrect privilege assignment**.\n\nCWE-284 was also considered, but is a more generic, parent-level CWE. The guidance discourages using CWE-284 if a more specific child CWE, such as CWE-266, is applicable.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-842: Placement of User into Incorrect Group\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.40\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-842: Placement of User into Incorrect Group\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-284: Improper Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 2.40\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control access to resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Pillar, which is a high level of abstraction, and might have Base-level or Variant-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance\n\n## ===Guidance===\n\n### Level Set \u2013 Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control\n\n**Access Control**:\nA broader term that includes both authentication and authorization.
