## Vulnerability Description
The Front End Users plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the order parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.28 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
