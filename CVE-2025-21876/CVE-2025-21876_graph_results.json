  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved iommu/vt-d Fix suspicious RCU usage Commit (iommu/vt-d Allocate DMAR fault interrupts locally) moved the call to enable_drhd_fault_handling() to a code path that does not hold any lock while traversing the drhd list. Fix it by ensuring the dmar_global_lock lock is held when traversing the drhd list.
