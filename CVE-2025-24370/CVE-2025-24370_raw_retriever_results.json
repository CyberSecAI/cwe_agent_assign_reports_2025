  "query": "Django-Unicorn adds modern reactive component functionality to Django templates. Affected versions of Django-Unicorn are vulnerable to python class pollution vulnerability. The vulnerability arises from the core functionality `set_property_value`, which can be remotely triggered by users by crafting appropriate component requests and feeding in values of second and third parameter to the vulnerable function, leading to arbitrary changes to the python runtime status. With this finding at least five ways of vulnerability exploitation have been observed, stably resulting in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Denial of Service (DoS), and Authentication Bypass attacks in almost every Django-Unicorn-based application. This issue has been addressed in version 0.62.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
