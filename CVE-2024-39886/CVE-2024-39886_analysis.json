  "description": "TONE store App version 3.4.2 and earlier contains an issue with **unprotected primary channel**. Since TONE store App communicates with TONE store website in cleartext, a man-in-the-middle attack may allow an attacker to obtain and/or alter communications of the affected App.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The TONE store App transmits data to the TONE store website in cleartext.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Cleartext Transmission:** The app does not encrypt communications with the TONE store website, which means data is sent without protection. This is classified as CWE-419 (Unprotected Transport of Credentials).\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** An attacker positioned in the network path can intercept the unencrypted traffic.\n- **Data Exposure:** The attacker can obtain the transmitted data.\n- **Data Modification:** The attacker may be able to alter the data being transmitted, potentially leading to manipulation of the application.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited via a network-based man-in-the-middle attack, especially on insecure networks (like public Wi-Fi).\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network Interception:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the TONE store app and the TONE store website. This could be done by setting up a malicious wireless access point or compromising a network device.\n- **Passive or Active Interception:** The attacker can either passively eavesdrop on the traffic or actively manipulate it.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- **Affected Product:** TONE store App version 3.4.2 and earlier, pre-installed on TONE smartphones.\n- **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is fixed in the latest version of the TONE store app. Users are advised to update to the latest version.\n- **CVSS Score:** 3.7 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N) indicating a network attack vector with high complexity, no privileges required, no user interaction needed, and a low impact on integrity.\n\nThis information is more detailed than the placeholder CVE description, providing clear information on the root cause, impact, and mitigations.",

CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is a more specific instance of CWE-419 (Unprotected Primary Channel). Since the vulnerability description clearly states that the communication occurs in cleartext, CWE-319 is a better fit.\nHere's a summary:\n  - CWE-419 is a broader category, while CWE-319 is a specific type of unprotected channel vulnerability.\n  - There is no direct parent-child relationship between CWE-419 and CWE-319, but they are related in that transmitting data in cleartext is a way to have an unprotected primary channel.\n  - No chain relationships are relevant in this particular case.\n  - The abstraction levels were considered, with both being at the Base level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe419[\"CWE-419: Unprotected Primary Channel\"]\n\n    cwe319 -- IS-A --> cwe419\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe419 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **cleartext transmission** of data, which leads to the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack, ultimately resulting in the **obtaining and/or altering of communications**.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information)\n  - **Impact:** Data exposure and potential data modification.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**unprotected primary channel**\" and that the TONE store App communicates with TONE store website in **cleartext**. This direct evidence strongly suggests that the primary weakness is related to transmitting data without encryption.\n\nThe retriever results listed CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) and CWE-419 (Unprotected Primary Channel) as relevant. CWE-319 had a higher sparse score.\nWhile CWE-419 is a valid concern, CWE-319 is more specific and accurately captures the essence of the vulnerability.\n\nThe decision to prioritize CWE-319 was influenced by the following factors:\n  - **Direct Evidence:** The vulnerability description explicitly states that the communication is in cleartext.\n  - **Specificity:** CWE-319 is a more specific weakness than CWE-419.\n  - **Retriever Results:** CWE-319 had a strong score, supporting its relevance.\n\nTherefore, CWE-319 is the optimal choice as the primary CWE, with CWE-419 as a supporting, secondary concern.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
