It provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The root cause is the lack of proper CSRF protection in the TabGarb Pro plugin.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n*   Broken Access Control (OWASP Top 10 - A1)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nA malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The impact varies case by case.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nThe attack vector is through exploiting the lack of CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to craft malicious requests.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Unauthenticated attacker.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   No official fix is currently available.\n*   Patchstack offers a \"vPatch\" to auto-mitigate the vulnerability.\n*   The vulnerability is considered low severity and unlikely to be exploited.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Affected Software:** TabGarb Pro Plugin\n*   **Vulnerable Versions:** <= 2.6\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.1 (Low)\n*   **Reported by:** Abdi Pranata\n*   **Published by:** Patchstack\n*   **PSID:** 2f42a94af23c",
