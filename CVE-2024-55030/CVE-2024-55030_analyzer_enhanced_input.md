## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
CVE-2024-55030 is related to the content.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Command Dispatcher Service does not properly handle multiple commands, leading to a queue overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) via Queue Overflow (CVE-2024-55030)
- Insecure Assertion Handling (CWE-617)
- Bad Default Configuration (CWE-453)
- Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) vulnerability due to lack of encryption.
- Multiple XSS vulnerabilities in fprime-gds (CVE-2024-55029)
- Template Injection on the Dashboard Tab of fprime-gds (CVE-2024-55028)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service, causing the system to crash.
- Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) via MitM attacks and command manipulation.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) allowing for malicious script execution in the browser.
- Data exfiltration via file manipulation.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a large number of commands to overflow the queue.
- Intercepting and manipulating communication between FSW and GDS (MitM).
- Exploiting XSS vulnerabilities by injecting malicious scripts.
- Manipulating file upload/download commands.
- Exploiting template injection vulnerability in the Dashboard tab.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the system.
- Ability to intercept and manipulate network traffic (for MitM attacks).
- Ability to send commands to the system.
- Understanding of the fprime framework and its communication protocols.

**Mitigation or fix:**
- Change the default behavior of queue overflow to block or drop commands.
- Implement a graceful handling mechanism for assertion failures.
- Encrypt communication between FSW and GDS.
- Sanitize all user inputs in the fprime-gds GUI.
- Implement integrity checks and authentication for file operations.
- Strengthen command validation with cryptographic signatures.
- Review and adjust default configurations to enhance security.
