  "query": "A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. This affects the function AssimpASEImporterBuildUniqueRepresentation of the file code/AssetLib/ASE/ASELoader.cpp of the component ASE File Handler. The manipulation of the argument mIndices leads to out-of-bounds read. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 6.0 is able to address this issue. The patch is named 7c705fde418d68cca4e8eff56be01b2617b0d6fe. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.",
