# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-3015

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. This affects the function AssimpASEImporterBuildUniqueRepresentation of the file code/AssetLib/ASE/ASELoader.cpp of the component ASE File Handler. The manipulation of the argument mIndices leads to **out-of-bounds read**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 6.0 is able to address this issue. The patch is named 7c705fde418d68cca4e8eff56be01b2617b0d6fe. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
# CVE-2025-3015

Based on the provided content, the following information can be extracted:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in `Assimp::ASEImporter::BuildUniqueRepresentation`.  Specifically, there is no boundary validation for the `(*i).mIndices[n]` value in `code/AssetLib/ASE/ASELoader.cpp:734`, which causes an out-of-bounds read in `mesh.mPositions`.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a remote code execution.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker could trigger the vulnerability by tricking a victim into running assimp on a malformed ASE file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious ASE file.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** The content shows a fix was implemented. Specifically, in `code/AssetLib/ASE/ASELoader.cpp`, the following was added:
    ```
    const uint32_t curIndex = (*i).mIndices[n];
    if (curIndex >= mesh.mPositions.size()) {
        throw DeadlyImportError("ASE: Invalid vertex index in face ", fi, ".");
    }
    ```

**More detail than the official CVE description:** The content provides the exact file and line number where the vulnerability exists. It also provides a PoC, a sanitizer report and the fix.
