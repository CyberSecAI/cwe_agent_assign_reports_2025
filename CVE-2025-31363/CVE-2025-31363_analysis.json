The **improper neutralization** leads to the ability to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The **prompt injection** is the root cause (CWE-1427), which then leads to the impact of potentially exfiltrating data from an arbitrary server (CWE-918).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1427[\"CWE-1427: Improper Neutralization of Input Used for LLM Prompting\"]\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n\n    cwe1427 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe918\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1427 primary\n    class cwe918 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper neutralization of input** used for LLM Prompting (**prompt injection**) (CWE-1427), which then leads to the ability to perform a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CWE-918), which allows exfiltration of data from an arbitrary server.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is that the application fails to properly neutralize input used for LLM prompting, allowing an attacker to perform a **prompt injection**. This, in turn, allows the attacker to potentially exfiltrate data using Server-Side Request Forgery.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states: \"fail to restrict domains the LLM can request to contact upstream which allows an authenticated user to exfiltrate data from an arbitrary server accessible to the victim via performing a **prompt injection** in the AI plugins Jira tool.\"\n\nI selected CWE-1427 as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability which is the **improper neutralization of input** used for LLM prompting. The description of CWE-1427, \"Improper Neutralization of Input Used for LLM Prompting\" matches the **prompt injection** vulnerability described.\n\nCWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery) is included as a secondary CWE because the **prompt injection** allows the attacker to make requests to arbitrary servers. The vulnerability description mentions, \"fail to restrict domains the LLM can request to contact upstream which allows an authenticated user to exfiltrate data from an arbitrary server\".\n\nCWE-74, CWE-94, CWE-78, CWE-89, CWE-917, CWE-1336 were considered but not selected as they are less directly related to the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context

product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage:
