# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-0218

## Vulnerability Description
When batch jobs are executed by pgAgent, a script is created in a temporary directory and then executed. In versions of pgAgent prior to 4.2.3, an **insufficiently seeded random number generator** is used when generating the directory name, leading to the possibility for a local attacker to pre-create the directory and thus prevent pgAgent from executing jobs, disrupting scheduled tasks.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficiently seeded random number generator**
- **impact:** prevent pgAgent from executing jobs
- **attacker:** local attacker
- **product:** pgAgent
- **version:** prior to 4.2.3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The content relates to CVE-2025-0218 as it discusses a security fix within the pgagent project. The commit message states: "Ensure the directory used for batch job step scripts is not predictable." and the diff shows changes to how temporary directories are created and used.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The original code used a predictable method for creating temporary directories for batch job steps, potentially allowing an attacker to anticipate the directory name.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Predictable temporary directory names. This could lead to potential security issues like arbitrary code execution if an attacker can predict the directory and place malicious files there.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Potential for arbitrary code execution by placing malicious scripts in a predictable temporary directory.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could potentially exploit this by predicting the temporary directory name and placing a malicious script with the expected name.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to predict the temporary directory name, which was based on the job ID and step ID.

**Mitigation or fix:**
The code was modified to use `boost::filesystem::unique_path` to create a truly unique temporary directory, making it much harder for an attacker to predict the directory name. The code now uses a prefix based on the job and step ID, combined with a random string, to generate a unique directory name.  Error handling and permission setting were also improved.

**More detail than official CVE description:**
Yes, the content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It shows the specific code changes made to address the vulnerability, including the use of `boost::filesystem` functions and the logic for generating unique directory names. It also details the previous method of directory creation and its weaknesses.
