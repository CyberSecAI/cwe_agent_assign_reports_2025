# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-0218
## Query
When batch jobs are executed by pgAgent, a script is created in a temporary directory and then executed. In versions of pgAgent prior to 4.2.3, an insufficiently seeded random number generator is used when generating the directory name, leading to the possibility for a local attacker to pre-create the directory and thus prevent pgAgent from executing jobs, disrupting scheduled tasks.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'insufficiently seeded random number generator'
