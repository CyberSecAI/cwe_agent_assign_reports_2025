Mitigation if you do not have Roller configured for untrusted users, then you need to do nothing because you trust your users to author raw HTML and other web content. If you are running with untrusted users then you should upgrade to Roller 6.1.3. This issue affects Apache Roller from 5.0.0 before 6.1.3. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 6.1.3, which fixes the issue.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'insufficient input validation'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
