  "description": "Insufficient input validation and sanitation in Profile name & screenname, Bookmark name & description and blogroll name features in all versions of Apache Roller on all platforms allows an authenticated user to perform an **XSS** attack. Mitigation if you do not have Roller configured for untrusted users, then you need to do nothing because you trust your users to author raw HTML and other web content. If you are running with untrusted users then you should upgrade to Roller 6.1.3. This issue affects Apache Roller from 5.0.0 before 6.1.3. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 6.1.3, which fixes the issue.",

This includes Profile name & screenname, Bookmark name & description and blogroll name features.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated user is required.

The vulnerability description explicitly states that **insufficient input validation** in multiple features of Apache Roller allows an authenticated user to perform an **XSS** attack. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-79, which involves the product not neutralizing or incorrectly neutralizing user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page served to other users.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is included as a secondary CWE because the root cause identified is **insufficient input validation**. While the primary impact is XSS, the underlying cause is a failure to properly validate and sanitize input, which is what CWE-20 addresses.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but deemed less appropriate:\n\n*   CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity): While this CWE appears in the retrieved results, there is no indication in the vulnerability description that inefficient regular expressions are involved.\n*   CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature): There is no mention of cryptographic signatures in the vulnerability description.\n*   CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output): While encoding and escaping are related to neutralization, the primary issue described is the **lack of input validation**, making CWE-79 a more direct fit.\n*   CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): The vulnerability description does not suggest any authorization issues, but rather focuses on input validation.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-79 is a Base level CWE that directly addresses the XSS vulnerability, while CWE-20 highlights the underlying input validation issue.",
