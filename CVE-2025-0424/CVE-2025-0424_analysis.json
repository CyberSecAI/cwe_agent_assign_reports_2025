CWE-306 is included as a secondary consideration since the attacker is authenticated, but the authentication may not be sufficient for the actions they are performing.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper user input sanitization** (CWE-79), leading to the ability to inject malicious JavaScript code.

The vulnerability description and key phrases directly point to this. The description mentions an authenticated attacker, which suggests there may be a secondary issue related to authentication for critical functions (CWE-306).
