CWE-128 [Wrap-around Error] is a peer of CWE-190 [Integer Overflow or Wraparound], and both can be related to integer handling issues.

This **integer underflow** leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference. The key phrase \"**Integer underflow**\" directly maps to CWE-191 [Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)]. The retriever results also support this mapping, with CWE-191 having the highest score.\n\nThe relationship graph shows that CWE-191 is a child of CWE-682 [Incorrect Calculation], providing a more general category if a more specific CWE wasn't available.\n\nThe selection of CWE-191 is at the optimal level of specificity because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**Integer underflow**\" as the root cause. Other CWEs considered, such as CWE-190 [Integer Overflow or Wraparound] and CWE-128 [Wrap-around Error], are related but do not precisely describe the **root cause** as accurately as CWE-191. CWE-128 and CWE-190 are added as secondary candidates since they are related to the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
