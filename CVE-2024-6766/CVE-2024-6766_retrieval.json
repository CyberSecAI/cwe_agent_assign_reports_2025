When a user views the page or post containing the vulnerable shortcode, the injected script will execute in their browser.\\n- This can lead to various malicious activities, including:\\n    - Cookie theft.\\n    - Session hijacking.\\n    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.\\n    - Defacement of the website.\\n    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious shortcode with a crafted payload injected into one of the shortcode attributes (e.g., `btn_background`).\\n- This crafted shortcode can then be embedded into a post or page.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- The attacker needs to have at least a \"Contributor\" role on the WordPress website, which allows them to create and modify content, including embedding shortcodes.\\n- The attacker does not need administrative access to exploit the vulnerability.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n- The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates how the `btn_background` attribute can be used to inject malicious JavaScript.\\n- The vulnerability is fixed in version 7.2.1 of the \"Shortcodes Ultimate Pro\" plugin.\\n- The CVSS score is 5.9 (Medium), indicating a moderate level of severity.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {95: {'cwe_counts': defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {}), 'total_samples': 5, 'distribution': [{'cwes': [], 'frequency': 5, 'proportion': 1.0}]}, 90: {'cwe_counts': defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {'CWE-79': 1}), 'total_samples': 3, 'distribution': [{'cwes': [], 'frequency': 2, 'proportion': 0.667}, {'cwes': ['CWE-79'], 'frequency': 1, 'proportion': 0.333}]}, 85: {'cwe_counts': defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {}), 'total_samples': 8, 'distribution': [{'cwes': [], 'frequency': 8, 'proportion': 1.0}]}, 80: {'cwe_counts': defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {}), 'total_samples': 8, 'distribution': [{'cwes': [], 'frequency': 8, 'proportion': 1.0}]}, 75: {'cwe_counts': defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {}), 'total_samples': 10, 'distribution': [{'cwes': [], 'frequency': 10, 'proportion': 1.0}]}, 70: {'cwe_counts': defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {}), 'total_samples': 10, 'distribution': [{'cwes': [], 'frequency': 10, 'proportion': 1.0}]}}, 'cwe_consensus': 'CWE-79', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [95, 90, 85, 80, 75, 70], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {95: 5, 90: 3, 85: 8, 80: 8, 75: 10, 70: 10}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {95: [], 90: [('CWE-79', 1)], 85: [], 80: [], 75: [], 70: []}}, 'raw_matches': [{'similarity': 95, 'cwes': [], 'total': 5, 'frequency': 5, 'proportion': 1.0}, {'similarity': 90, 'cwes': [], 'total': 3, 'frequency': 2, 'proportion': 0.667}, {'similarity': 90, 'cwes': ['79'], 'total': 3, 'frequency': 1, 'proportion': 0.333}, {'similarity': 85, 'cwes': [], 'total': 8, 'frequency': 8, 'proportion': 1.0}, {'similarity': 80, 'cwes': [], 'total': 8, 'frequency': 8, 'proportion': 1.0}, {'similarity': 75, 'cwes': [], 'total': 10, 'frequency': 10, 'proportion': 1.0}, {'similarity': 70, 'cwes': [], 'total': 10, 'frequency': 10, 'proportion': 1.0}]}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='CWE-79', top_cwes=[('CWE-79', 1)], confidence_levels={'high': [], 'medium': [], 'low': []}, total_samples=44), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes', 'keyphrase': 'does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:Cross-Site Scripting', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:does not validate and escape', 'keyphrase': 'does not validate and escape', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks', 'keyphrase': 'Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'attacker:users with the contributor role and above', 'keyphrase': 'users with the contributor role and above', 'type': 'attacker'}, {'id': 'product:shortcodes-ultimate-pro WordPress plugin', 'keyphrase': 'shortcodes-ultimate-pro WordPress plugin', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:before 7.2.1', 'keyphrase': 'before 7.2.1', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(553.7542806714168)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
