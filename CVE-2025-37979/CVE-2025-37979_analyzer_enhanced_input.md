## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ASoC qcom Fix sc7280 lpass potential **buffer overflow** Case values introduced in commit 5f78e1fb7a3e (ASoC qcom Add driver support for audioreach solution) cause out of bounds access in arrays of sc7280 driver data (e.g. in case of RX_CODEC_DMA_RX_0 in sc7280_snd_hw_params()). Redefine LPASS_MAX_PORTS to consider the maximum possible port id for q6dsp as sc7280 driver utilizes some of those values. Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **buffer overflow**
- **impact:** out of bounds access
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** ASoC qcom sc7280 driver
