  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ASoC qcom Fix sc7280 lpass potential buffer overflow Case values introduced in commit 5f78e1fb7a3e (ASoC qcom Add driver support for audioreach solution) cause out of bounds access in arrays of sc7280 driver data (e.g. in case of RX_CODEC_DMA_RX_0 in sc7280_snd_hw_params()). Redefine LPASS_MAX_PORTS to consider the maximum possible port id for q6dsp as sc7280 driver utilizes some of those values. Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
