CWE-123 is at the Base level because there isn't enough information to determine a more specific variant.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-416: Use After Free\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory \"belongs\" to the code that operates on the new pointer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 5.03\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-590\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-479\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-416\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-364\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-134\n\n\n## CWE Relationship Analysis\n\nCurrent CWEs represent these abstraction levels: .\n\n\n### Vulnerability Chain Analysis\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-123:**\n- 123 (Write-what-where Condition) - ROOT\n\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-479:**\n- 479 (Signal Handler Use of a Non-reentrant Function) - ROOT\n\n\n\n### CWE Relationship Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n```",
