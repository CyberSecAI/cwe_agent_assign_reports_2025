  "reference_content": "```\nRoot cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is caused by the `ogs_dbi_auth_info` function in `lib/dbi/subscription.c` not properly validating the `supi_id` before using it. Specifically, the `ogs_id_get_value` function in `lib/proto/types.c` fails to extract the `supi_id` if the input `ueId` (e.g., \"imsiMALFORMED\") does not contain a hyphen. This leads to a crash due to an assertion failure.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n*   Improper Input Validation: The code does not adequately validate the format of the `ueId` (SUPI), leading to unexpected behavior when the format is incorrect.\n*   Assertion Failure: The `ogs_dbi_auth_info` function contains an assertion (`ogs_assert(supi_id)`) that fails when `supi_id` is invalid, causing the UDR to crash.\n\nImpact of exploitation: The impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service (DoS) condition. The UDR (User Data Repository) crashes, making it unavailable.\n\nAttack vectors: The attack vector is sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the `/subscription-data` endpoint of the Nudr\\_DataRepository API with a malformed `ueId` (SUPI) in the URL.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\n*   Network access to the Open5GS core network.\n*   Ability to send HTTP requests to the Nudr\\_DataRepository API.\n*   Knowledge of the API endpoint and the expected data format.\n\nMitigation or fix: The suggested remediation involves adding appropriate checks within the `ogs_dbi_auth_info` function to ensure that the `supi_id` variable contains a valid value before it is passed to the `ogs_assert(supi_id)` call. The provided patch in commit 08b9e7c addresses this issue by adding checks to validate the SUPI ID.\n```\n\n**More detail than the official CVE description:** The provided content gives detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including code examples and log analysis, and suggests a specific fix. It also includes the root cause and attack vectors.",

The vulnerability occurs because the `ogs_dbi_auth_info` function does not properly validate the `supi_id` before using it, which is a classic example of improper input validation.\n\n**CWE-617 (Reachable Assertion)** is a secondary weakness. The improper input leads to an assertion failure (`ogs_assert(supi_id)`), causing the UDR to crash. Thus, it is the direct result of the first weakness.\n\nHere's the graph showing these relationships:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe617[\"CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\"]\n\n    cwe617 -->|RESULT_OF| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe617 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper input validation** (CWE-20). Because the `supi_id` is not properly validated, a malformed input can reach the assertion. The assertion `ogs_assert(supi_id)` then fails (**CWE-617**), leading to a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is heavily based on the provided evidence, especially the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\".\n\n> Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is caused by the `ogs_dbi_auth_info` function in `lib/dbi/subscription.c` not properly validating the `supi_id` before using it.
