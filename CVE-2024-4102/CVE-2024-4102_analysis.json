  "description": "The Pricing Table plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a **missing capability check** on the ajax() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to perform unauthorized actions like editing pricing tables.",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4102\n\n**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check within the `ajax()` function of the Pricing Table plugin for WordPress. This function handles AJAX requests for various actions, such as adding, updating, and removing pricing tables. The absence of a capability check allows any authenticated user, including those with minimal \"subscriber\" level access, to perform these actions, which should be restricted to administrators or other privileged roles.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n* **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the lack of proper authorization checks before executing actions in the `ajax()` function. This allows users without the necessary permissions to interact with the plugin in an unintended manner.\n* **Insecure AJAX Handling:** The plugin uses AJAX to handle various operations but fails to verify user capabilities before processing requests.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n* **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Attackers can add, modify, or remove pricing tables. This could lead to data corruption, defacement of the website, or the insertion of malicious content within the pricing tables.\n* **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While the immediate impact seems limited to modifying pricing tables, this type of vulnerability could be a stepping stone to other, more significant attacks if other areas of the plugin or site are vulnerable.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n* **Network:** The attack is conducted via network requests to the WordPress site, specifically AJAX calls.\n* **Authentication Required:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site. However, the required access level is very low (subscriber or higher).\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n* **WordPress Account:**  The attacker needs a valid user account on the affected WordPress site with minimal access privileges (subscriber or higher).\n* **Knowledge of AJAX Endpoint:** The attacker must know the correct AJAX endpoint used by the plugin and the specific parameters to send to trigger the vulnerable code.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n* The vulnerability is present in all versions of the Pricing Table plugin up to and including 2.0.1.\n* No patch is currently available. The recommendation is to uninstall the plugin or apply custom mitigations based on risk tolerance.\n* The vulnerable code snippet is in `widgets-api.php` specifically in the `ajax()` function which does not check capabilities before calling the relevant methods\n* The provided code highlights methods that can be called through AJAX such as `postAdd`, `postRemove`, `postRestore`, and `postUpdate`, all of which are vulnerable.",

The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. |\n| CWE-417 | Improper Shutdown of Thread | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. The product does not properly terminate or release a thread before the thread is abandoned. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the hierarchical relationship with the parent CWE. CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE, and there might be more specific Base-level children. However, the provided information does not specify the exact type of authorization missing, so the Class level is appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    \n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing capability check**, leading to unauthorized data access and modification.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-862 (Missing Authorization)\n  - **Impact:** Unauthorized actions, data modification, potential defacement.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference. The key phrase \"**missing capability check**\" strongly indicates a **missing authorization** issue. The CVE reference confirms this by stating that the `ajax()` function lacks proper authorization checks, allowing users with minimal access to perform privileged actions. CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is the most appropriate primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity given the available evidence. While more specific Base-level children of CWE-862 might exist, the current information does not provide enough details to pinpoint the exact type of missing authorization.\n\nRelevant CWE
