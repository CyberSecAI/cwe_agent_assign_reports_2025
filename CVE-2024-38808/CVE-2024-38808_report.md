## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-917 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection') | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-917, which deals with the **improper neutralization of special elements** in Expression Language statements. This is directly related to the vulnerability description, which mentions a specially crafted Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expression. CWE-917 is a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')), which is a more general class of injection vulnerabilities.

CWE-400, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, is a potential impact of the vulnerability. It is related to the described denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of user-supplied SpEL expressions (CWE-917). This leads to the ability to inject malicious expressions, which in turn causes uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400), resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the CVE reference content summary, which highlight the use of specially crafted SpEL expressions to cause a denial of service. The primary weakness is the **improper handling of these expressions**, which aligns with CWE-917. The impact of the vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS), which is related to CWE-400.

The graph relationships show that CWE-917 can lead to CWE-400. This supports the mapping of both CWEs.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-917 is a base-level CWE that directly addresses the **improper neutralization** of SpEL expressions. CWE-400 is a class-level CWE that describes the resulting uncontrolled resource consumption, a common impact of vulnerabilities.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Evidence**: The vulnerability description explicitly mentions specially crafted Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expressions. This is a direct match to the CWE description.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

**Why Not Used**: This CWE is more general and doesn't specifically address the use of expression languages.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

**Why Not Used**: While CWE-74 is a parent of CWE-917, CWE-917 is a more specific match for the vulnerability.

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why Not Used**: This CWE is specific to web scripting and is not relevant to the vulnerability.

## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

**Why Not Used**: This CWE is a more general class, while CWE-917 is a more specific match.

## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why Not Used**: While input validation might be a mitigating factor, the primary issue is the **improper neutralization** of special elements.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why Not Used**: The vulnerability is not about an incomplete list of disallowed inputs, but about **improper neutralization** of special elements in SpEL expressions.

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Why Not Used**: This CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability.

## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine
**Abstraction Level**: Base
