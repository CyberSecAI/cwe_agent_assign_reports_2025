  "description": "In lj_str_hash.c in OpenResty 1.19.3.1 through 1.25.3.1, the string hashing function (used during string interning) allows **HashDoS** (Hash Denial of Service) attacks. An attacker could cause excessive resource usage during proxy operations via crafted requests, potentially leading to a denial of service with relatively few incoming requests. This vulnerability only exists in the OpenResty fork in the openresty/luajit2 GitHub repository. The LuaJIT/LuaJIT repository. is unaffected.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-39702:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from a performance issue related to hash computation optimization within the OpenResty branch of LuaJIT. This optimization, specific to OpenResty's LuaJIT branch, could lead to severe performance degradation under certain conditions. It is explicitly stated that the issue does NOT originate from upstream LuaJIT.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Inefficient Hash Computation:** The specific optimization in LuaJIT's hash computation is flawed, leading to performance degradation. The content indicates that the optimization has been disabled in the fix.\n*   The issue is described as causing \u201csevere performance degradation\u201d, implying the potential for denial of service.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   The primary impact is **severe performance degradation**. While not explicitly stated, the mention of the potential for \"severe performance degradation\" suggests that under specific conditions, the server could become unresponsive or extremely slow, affecting availability of the service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   The content doesn't explicitly specify an attack vector, however, given the nature of hash computation within a web server, it's reasonable to infer that the vulnerability could be triggered by specific input or workload patterns which cause the faulty hash computation optimization to be exercised, resulting in the performance degradation. \n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   An attacker would need to induce a specific workload pattern that triggers the problematic hash computation logic within the OpenResty application. The attacker might not require privileged access, and it's likely that they could exploit this remotely by sending specific HTTP requests or other inputs that result in the flawed hash computation.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n\n*   The provided content mentions that the vulnerability was reported by Zhongwei Yao from Kong Inc.\n*   The fix involves disabling the problematic optimization in LuaJIT.\n*   OpenResty version 1.25.3.2 includes this fix.",
