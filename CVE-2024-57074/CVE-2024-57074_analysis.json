Specifically, the `lib.merge` and `lib.set` functions are vulnerable.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\nPrototype Pollution\n\nImpact of exploitation:\nDenial of Service (DoS) at a minimum. Potential for injection-based attacks and arbitrary command execution if the polluted prototype propagates to sensitive Node.js APIs.\n\nAttack vectors:\nSupplying a payload with `Object.prototype` setter to the `lib.merge` or `lib.set` functions.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\nAn attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `lib.merge` or `lib.set` functions.\n\nMitigation or fix:\nThe advisory does not specify a fix, but implies updating the package would be necessary.\n\nThe content provides more detail than the official CVE description would likely contain, specifically the PoC and detailed explanation of impact.",

For example, CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) could be a consequence of the DoS, but it is not the root cause. Similarly, CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion) and CWE-776 (Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')) are related to resource consumption but not directly to **prototype pollution**.",
