CWE-759 is the most specific match for the vulnerability since it explicitly mentions the **use of one-way hashes without salts**. CWE-916 is more general, referring to password hashes with insufficient computational effort. CWE-328 refers to the use of weak hashes in general.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe759[\"CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt\"]\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    cwe328[\"CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\"]\n    \n    cwe759 -->|CHILDOF| cwe916\n    cwe759 -->|CHILDOF| cwe328\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe759 primary\n    class cwe916,cwe328 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of one-way hashes without salts** (CWE-759), which leads to the possibility of a Rainbow Table Password cracking attack. The root cause is the **improper implementation of password storage**. The impact is that an attacker can potentially crack user passwords.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-759 because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **use of one-way hashes without salts**. This is the most specific CWE that accurately represents the vulnerability. The supporting evidence is the vulnerability description itself. \"An issue in Horizon Business Services Inc. Caterease 16.0.1.1663 through 24.0.1.2405 and possibly later versions, allows a remote attacker to perform a Rainbow Table Password cracking attack due to the **use of one-way hashes without salts** when storing user passwords.\"\n\nCWE-916 and CWE-328 were considered as secondary candidates because they are related to weak password hashing, but they are not as specific as CWE-759.\n\nRelevant

Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level

Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a one-way cryptographic hash against an input that should not be reversible, such as a password, but the product does not also use a salt as part of the input.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage:

Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-836: Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe

Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-760: Use of

Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded

in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users. In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders. If a system administrator can recover a password directly, or use a brute force search on the available information, the administrator can use the password on other accounts.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
