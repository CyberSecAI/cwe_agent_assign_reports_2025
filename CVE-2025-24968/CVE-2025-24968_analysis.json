  "description": "reNgine is an automated reconnaissance framework for web applications. An **unrestricted project deletion** vulnerability allows attackers with specific roles, such as `penetration_tester` or `auditor` to delete all projects in the system. This can lead to a complete system takeover by redirecting the attacker to the onboarding page, where they can add or modify users, including Sys Admins, and configure critical settings like API keys and user preferences. This issue affects all versions up to and including 2.20. Users are advised to monitor the project for future releases which address this issue. There are no known workarounds.",

The system allows users with specific roles (e.g., penetration\\_tester or auditor) to delete all projects without proper authorization. This leads to a system takeover because the system redirects to the onboarding page when no projects exist, allowing attackers to reconfigure the system.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    *   CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)\n*   **Impact of exploitation:**\n    *   Deletion of all projects in the system.\n    *   Access to the onboarding page.\n    *   Ability to reconfigure the system.\n    *   Ability to add new users with elevated privileges (e.g., Sys Admin).\n    *   Ability to change critical configurations.\n    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) using the install tools function in Tool Arsenal.\n*   **Attack vectors:**\n    *   Sending repeated POST requests to `/delete/project/<id>` to brute-force project deletion.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n    *   Requires a user account with roles like `penetration_tester` or `auditor`.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** The content mentions the vulnerability exists in versions `< 2.2.0`, but does not provide a patch or mitigation.\n*   **More detail than the official CVE description:** Yes, the content provides detailed information including the root cause, attack vector, impact, and affected versions.",

CWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, is a peer and potential refinement of CWE-284, but still at the Class level. CWE-639, Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key, is a Base-level CWE representing a more specific authorization issue. The choice of CWE-284 as primary is justified by the high-level nature of the vulnerability, where a role-based access control **flaw** allows unauthorized actions.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|PEEROF| cwe284\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **unrestricted project deletion**, leading to complete system takeover.\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-284 Improper Access Control - Users with `penetration_tester` or `auditor` roles can delete all projects due to **missing or incorrect authorization**.\n2.  Impact: Deletion of all projects.\n3.  Impact: Redirection to the onboarding page.\n4.  Impact: System reconfiguration and addition of new privileged users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **unrestricted project deletion** as a key indicator. The analysis of the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary pointed to an authorization issue. The Retriever Results suggested CWE-285, CWE-863, and CWE-639 as potential candidates.\nThe final decision was influenced by the root cause which is an **unrestricted project deletion** vulnerability and impact, which is a complete system takeover. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) best captures the essence of the vulnerability, as it is a high-level access control issue where users with specific roles can perform actions they are not authorized to perform (deleting all projects).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212:
