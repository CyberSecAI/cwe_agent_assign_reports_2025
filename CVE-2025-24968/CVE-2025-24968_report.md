# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-24968

## Description

reNgine is an automated reconnaissance framework for web applications. An **unrestricted project deletion** vulnerability allows attackers with specific roles, such as `penetration_tester` or `auditor` to delete all projects in the system. This can lead to a complete system takeover by redirecting the attacker to the onboarding page, where they can add or modify users, including Sys Admins, and configure critical settings like API keys and user preferences. This issue affects all versions up to and including 2.20. Users are advised to monitor the project for future releases which address this issue. There are no known workarounds.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** unrestricted project deletion
- **Product:** reNgine
- **Impact:** delete all projects in the system, system takeover
- **Attacker:** attackers with specific roles
- **Version:** up to and including 2.20

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 1.0 | Class | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.8 | Class | Secondary Candidate | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | 0.7 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-284 Improper Access Control, which is a Class-level CWE. CWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, is a peer and potential refinement of CWE-284, but still at the Class level. CWE-639, Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key, is a Base-level CWE representing a more specific authorization issue. The choice of CWE-284 as primary is justified by the high-level nature of the vulnerability, where a role-based access control **flaw** allows unauthorized actions.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **unrestricted project deletion**, leading to complete system takeover.
1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-284 Improper Access Control - Users with `penetration_tester` or `auditor` roles can delete all projects due to **missing or incorrect authorization**.
2.  Impact: Deletion of all projects.
3.  Impact: Redirection to the onboarding page.
4.  Impact: System reconfiguration and addition of new privileged users.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified the **unrestricted project deletion** as a key indicator. The analysis of the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary pointed to an authorization issue. The Retriever Results suggested CWE-285, CWE-863, and CWE-639 as potential candidates.
The final decision was influenced by the root cause which is an **unrestricted project deletion** vulnerability and impact, which is a complete system takeover. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) best captures the essence of the vulnerability, as it is a high-level access control issue where users with specific roles can perform actions they are not authorized to perform (deleting all projects).

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.



## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.

**Mapping Guidance**:
