## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-2659 Content

Based on the provided content, this report details a SQL injection vulnerability in the "projectworlds Online Time Table Generator Portal-Source code".

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the 'e' parameter in the `/student/index.php` file. The application directly uses this parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   System control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable via the 'e' parameter in a POST request to `/student/index.php`.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.
*   Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding to separate SQL code from user input.
*   Implement strict input validation and filtering.
*   Minimize database user permissions.
*   Conduct regular security audits.

**Additional Details (More than official CVE description):**

*   The report provides a sample payload using `sqlmap` to demonstrate the vulnerability.
*   It includes screenshots of `sqlmap` output showing database enumeration.
*   Specific file and parameter details are provided (`/student/index.php`, 'e' parameter).
*   The affected and potentially fixed versions are specified (Affected Version: Current release (as of 2025-03-14), Fixed Version: Not patched as of vulnerability disclosure).
