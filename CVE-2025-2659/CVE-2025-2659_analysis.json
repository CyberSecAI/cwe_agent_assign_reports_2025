  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-2659 Content\n\nBased on the provided content, this report details a SQL injection vulnerability in the \"projectworlds Online Time Table Generator Portal-Source code\".\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the 'e' parameter in the `/student/index.php` file. The application directly uses this parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering\n*   System control\n*   Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is exploitable via the 'e' parameter in a POST request to `/student/index.php`.\n*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.\n*   Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding to separate SQL code from user input.\n*   Implement strict input validation and filtering.\n*   Minimize database user permissions.\n*   Conduct regular security audits.\n\n**Additional Details (More than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The report provides a sample payload using `sqlmap` to demonstrate the vulnerability.\n*   It includes screenshots of `sqlmap` output showing database enumeration.\n*   Specific file and parameter details are provided (`/student/index.php`, 'e' parameter).\n*   The affected and potentially fixed versions are specified (Affected Version: Current release (as of 2025-03-14), Fixed Version: Not patched as of vulnerability disclosure).\n*   Software link is provided: <https://projectworlds.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/timetable.zip>\n*   Vendor Homepage: <https://projectworlds.in/online-time-table-generator-php-mysql/>",

The application does not neutralize special elements that could modify the intended SQL command. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-89, which is a base-level CWE. There are no parent-child or chain relationships that significantly influence the selection in this case, as the description clearly points to SQL Injection due to **improper neutralization**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-89 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') due to the **lack of input validation** of the 'e' parameter.\n2.  **Impact:** Unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, system control, and service interruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions \"**sql injection**\" as the **weakness**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the root cause as **insufficient user input validation** of the 'e' parameter, leading to SQL injection. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the most relevant CWE.\n\nThe evidence directly supports the selection of CWE-89. No other CWEs were selected as there was no indication of additional weaknesses beyond the described SQL injection. The selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
