While other CWEs were considered, such as those related to injection vulnerabilities (CWE-79, CWE-89, CWE-78), they didn't directly align with the root cause of **improper access control**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe284 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access controls** (CWE-284), which directly allows unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis identified CWE-284 as the most appropriate mapping because the vulnerability description explicitly states \"**improper access controls**\". The retriever results also listed CWE-306 \"Missing Authentication for Critical Function\" which is related to access control but not as direct a mapping as CWE-284.
