# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-0207

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in code-projects Online Shoe Store 1.0. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /function/login.php. The manipulation of the argument password leads to sql injection. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** /function/login.php
- **weakness:** **['SQL injection', 'sql injection']**
- **product:** code-projects Online Shoe Store
- **version:** 1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of input sanitization in the `/function/login.php` file of an online shoe store application. The application directly uses the `$email` and `$password` parameters from POST requests in an SQL query without any validation, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application does not sanitize the email and password parameters, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.
- **Lack of input validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize user inputs before using them in SQL queries

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized database access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially extracting sensitive user information (e.g., usernames, passwords, customer details)
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The attacker might be able to achieve remote code execution on the server by using advanced SQL injection techniques.
- **Database manipulation:** An attacker can potentially modify or delete data within the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request:** The attack vector is via HTTP POST requests to `/function/login.php`, where the attacker injects malicious SQL code through the `email` and `password` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Basic understanding of SQL injection:** The attacker needs some understanding of SQL syntax to craft malicious payloads.
- No prior authentication is required since this is the login page of the application.
