  "description": "BlueZ HID over GATT Profile **Improper Access Control** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of BlueZ. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the implementation of the HID over GATT Profile. The issue results from the **lack of authorization** prior to allowing access to functionality. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-25177.",

The **missing authentication** (**CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function]**) is a prerequisite for the **improper access control**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **CWE-284 [Improper Access Control]**, evidenced by the phrase \"**lack of authorization** prior to allowing access to functionality.\" This aligns with the definition of **CWE-284 [Improper Access Control]**, where the product \"does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.\" The impact is that \"An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user,\" indicating remote code execution.\n\n**CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function]** is a secondary weakness because the **lack of authentication** likely enables the **improper access control**.\n\n**CWE-787 [Out-of-bounds Write]** is considered a potential impact, as the **improper access control** could lead to memory corruption, but there is no explicit evidence of this in the description, resulting in lower confidence.\n\nThe retriever results listed several other CWEs, including **CWE-20 [Improper Input Validation]**, **CWE-620 [Unverified Password Change]**, and **CWE-1284 [Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input]**.
