  "description": "The Popup Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Sensitive Information Exposure** in all versions up to, and including, 4.3.3 via the Subscribers Import feature. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data after an administrator has imported subscribers via a CSV file. This data may include the first name, last name, e-mail address, and potentially other personally identifiable information of subscribers.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2541:\n\n**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**\n   - The provided content from Wordfence explicitly mentions CVE-2024-2541 and describes a vulnerability in the \"Popup Builder\" WordPress plugin related to sensitive information exposure via imported subscriber CSV files. This aligns with the CVE description mentioning a vulnerability in the same plugin.\n\n**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**\n   - The vulnerability stems from the way the \"Popup Builder\" plugin handles the import of subscribers via CSV files. After an administrator imports subscriber data, the plugin fails to protect this data adequately, making it accessible to unauthorized users.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n   - **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The core weakness is the exposure of sensitive data, specifically subscriber information (first name, last name, email address, and possibly other PII) after it has been imported via CSV.\n   - **Lack of access control:** The plugin does not implement proper access controls to prevent unauthorized access to the imported subscriber data.\n\n**4. Impact of exploitation:**\n   - **Exposure of PII:** Attackers can obtain sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) of website subscribers.\n   - **Privacy Violation:** This data breach can lead to privacy violations and potential misuse of personal information, such as spamming or identity theft.\n\n**5. Attack vectors:**\n   - The vulnerability is exploited via the Subscribers Import feature of the plugin after an administrator imports subscriber data through a CSV file.\n   - Unauthenticated attackers are able to exploit this vulnerability by gaining access to the imported data.\n\n**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n   - **Unauthenticated access:** Attackers do not need to have an account or be logged in to the website to exploit this vulnerability.\n   - **Network access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the affected WordPress site to extract the subscriber data.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n   - The Wordfence article explicitly states that there is no known patch available for this vulnerability.\n   - The vulnerability affects all versions of the Popup Builder plugin up to and including version 4.3.6.\n   - The Wordfence article provides a CVSS score of 5.3 (Medium) and a CVSS vector string: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N`\n   - The file `Importer.php` is directly referenced as part of the vulnerability analysis.",
