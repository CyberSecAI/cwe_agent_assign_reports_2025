## Vulnerability Description
rejetto HFS (aka HTTP File Server) 3 before 0.52.10 on Linux, UNIX, and macOS allows OS command execution by remote authenticated users (if they have Upload permissions). This occurs because a shell is used to execute df (i.e., with execSync instead of spawnSync in child_process in Node.js).

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **use of execSync instead of spawnSync for commands in child_process**
- **impact:** OS command execution
- **attacker:** remote authenticated users
- **product:** rejetto HFS
- **version:** 3 before 0.52.10

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to CVE-2024-39943.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the application executes system commands. Specifically, the `execSync` function was being used to execute a `df -k` command, which could be manipulated by an attacker through the file path.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection:** The application was vulnerable to command injection because it directly interpolated user-provided paths into the command being executed. By including shell metacharacters (e.g., backticks, semicolons) within the path, an attacker could inject arbitrary commands that would be executed by the server.
- **Insecure System Call:** The use of `execSync` was an insecure practice that could be easily exploited when used with user-provided input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the user running the application. This could lead to complete compromise of the system, including data theft, modification, or deletion, and the installation of malware.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves crafting a malicious file path containing shell metacharacters and injecting it through the application's interface where it processes the path to execute system commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to provide file paths to the application. This might be through an upload functionality or some other interface where the application processes paths. The attacker would need a way to provide a path that would be passed to the vulnerable `execSync` function.
The fix replaces `execSync` with `spawnSync` passing the path as an argument. This mitigates the command injection risk as it prevents the shell interpretation of metacharacters within the path parameter.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set ‚Äì Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* üîç *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* üîç *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion ‚Äì CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### üî∏ CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúA user created with the ‚Äòguest‚Äô role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúThe backup service runs as root but only needs read access.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### üî∏ CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúUser can access another user‚Äôs invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.‚Äù*

## Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *‚ÄúUser can escalate privileges to admin.‚Äù*
> ‚ùå Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged ‚Äì only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ‚úÖ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**
