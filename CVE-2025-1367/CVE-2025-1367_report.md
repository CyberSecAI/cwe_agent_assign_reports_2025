# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-1367

## Description

A vulnerability was found in MicroWord eScan Antivirus 7.0.32 on Linux. It has been classified as critical. This affects the function sprintf of the component USB Password Handler. The manipulation leads to **buffer overflow**. An attack has to be approached locally. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Weakness:** buffer overflow
- **Product:** MicroWord eScan Antivirus
- **Version:** 7.0.32
- **Component:** USB Password Handler

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-120 | Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.6 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship considered was the parent-child relationship between CWE-119 and CWE-120. CWE-120 is a more specific case of CWE-119. Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions "buffer overflow" caused by `sprintf`, and the lack of size checking during the copy operation is implied, CWE-120 is the better fit.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a buffer copy operation performed without checking the size of the input, leading to a buffer overflow.
  - **Root Cause:** CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input
  - **Impact:** Buffer Overflow

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly indicates a **buffer overflow** due to the `sprintf` function in the USB Password Handler component of MicroWord eScan Antivirus. The description states "The manipulation leads to **buffer overflow**". Given the evidence, the primary CWE is CWE-120.

CWE-119 was considered because it is a broader category encompassing buffer overflows. However, CWE-120 is more specific, as it explicitly refers to buffer copies without size checking, which is a common cause of buffer overflows, especially in older code using functions like `sprintf`.

The choice of CWE-120 is further supported by the "Retriever Results," which lists CWE-120 as a strong candidate.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.



## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 535.13
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 512.68
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
