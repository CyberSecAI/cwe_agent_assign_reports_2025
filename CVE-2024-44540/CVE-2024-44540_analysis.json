By modifying the `bootargs` variable in U-Boot, the system can be forced to execute `/bin/sh` instead of the regular `/init` process, resulting in a root shell without requiring authentication.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n- Unprotected access to the bootloader via the UART interface.\n- Ability to modify boot parameters via the bootloader.\n- Insecure boot process that allows for arbitrary command execution.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n- Complete bypass of the login mechanism, granting root shell access.\n- Ability to read and modify the device's configuration, including the user password hash.\n- Ability to perform a factory reset or change the admin password.\n- Potential to upload a modified firmware.\n- Complete control over the vulnerable device.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n- Physical access to the device to connect to the UART interface.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n- Physical access to the Ubiquiti Airmax device.\n- Basic knowledge of electronics, serial communication, and U-Boot.\n- Ability to identify UART pins (VCC, GND, TX, RX) on the device\u2019s PCB.\n- Serial to USB adapter and a computer with a serial terminal program.",

The vulnerability stems from the lack of protection on the UART interface, allowing unauthorized access to the bootloader. |\n| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The device does not properly authenticate access to the bootloader via the UART interface, enabling attackers to modify boot parameters and gain a root shell. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the selection is that CWE-1299 describes the core issue of a missing protection mechanism for an alternate hardware interface (UART).

This allows an attacker with physical access to bypass the normal boot process. Because of **missing authentication** (CWE-306), the attacker can then modify boot parameters and execute arbitrary commands, ultimately gaining a root shell.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, especially the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section. The key phrase is the **unprotected access** to the bootloader via the UART interface. This directly maps to CWE-1299 (Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface). The ability to modify boot parameters and execute commands without authentication points to a **missing authentication** issue which maps to CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function).\n\nCWE-1299 is the most specific and appropriate classification as it addresses the root cause of the vulnerability which is the unprotected alternate hardware interface i.e. the UART Debugging Port.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-912: Hidden Functionality\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains functionality that is not documented, not part of the specification, and not accessible through an interface or command sequence that is obvious to the product's users or administrators.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Used:* The vulnerability is not due to hidden functionality but rather due to a lack of protection on an exposed interface.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* The vulnerability does not directly involve hard-coded credentials, although the lack of authentication allows attackers to bypass credential checks.\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* While the attacker can execute commands, the root cause is not due to command injection, but rather a lack of authentication and protection on the UART interface.\n\n## CWE-1299: Missing Protection Mechanism for Alternate Hardware Interface\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe lack of protections on alternate paths to access\n                control-protected assets (such as unprotected shadow registers\n                and other external facing unguarded interfaces) allows an\n                attacker to bypass existing protections to the asset that are\n\t\tonly performed against the primary path.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Used:* This CWE directly addresses the vulnerability, which stems from the lack of protection on the UART interface.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
