  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved tcp correct handling of extreme memory squeeze Testing with iperf3 using the pasta protocol splicer has revealed a problem in the way tcp handles window advertising in extreme memory squeeze situations. Under memory pressure, a socket endpoint may temporarily advertise a zero-sized window, but this is not stored as part of the socket data. The reasoning behind this is that it is considered a temporary setting which shouldnt influence any further calculations. However, if we happen to stall at an unfortunate value of the current window size, the algorithm selecting a new value will consistently fail to advertise a non-zero window once we have freed up enough memory. This means that this sides notion of the current window size is different from the one last advertised to the peer, causing the latter to not send any data to resolve the sitution. The problem occurs on the iperf3 server side, and the socket in question is a completely regular socket with the default settings for the fedora40 kernel. We do not use SO_PEEK or SO_RCVBUF on the socket. The following excerpt of a logging session, with own comments added, shows more in detail what is happening // tcp_v4_rcv(->) // tcp_rcv_established(->) [520139222] ==== Activating log @ net/ipv4/tcp_input.c/tcp_data_queue()/5257 ==== [520139222] tcp_data_queue(->) [520139222] DROPPING skb [265600160..265665640], reason SKB_DROP_REASON_PROTO_MEM [rcv_nxt 265600160, rcv_wnd 262144, snt_ack 265469200, win_now 131184] [copied_seq 259909392->260034360 (124968), unread 5565800, qlen 85, ofoq 0] [OFO queue gap 65480, len 0] [520139222] tcp_data_queue(39222] __tcp_transmit_skb(->) [tp->rcv_wup 265469200, tp->rcv_wnd 262144, tp->rcv_nxt 265600160] [520139222] tcp_select_window(->) [520139222] (inet_csk(sk)->icsk_ack.pending & ICSK_ACK_NOMEM) ? --> TRUE [tp->rcv_wup 265469200, tp->rcv_wnd 262144, tp->rcv_nxt 265600160] returning 0 [520139222] tcp_select_window(39222] ADVERTISING WIN 0, ACK_SEQ 265600160 [520139222] [__tcp_transmit_skb(39222] tcp_rcv_established(39222] tcp_v4_rcv(rcv_wnd and tp->rcv_wup accordingly, which means // we unconditionally shrink the window.

Additionally, the description points to resource allocation problems under memory pressure, suggesting a potential lack of limits which aligns with CWE-770.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper** handling of resource allocation limits (**CWE-770**). This leads to a state where the system cannot recover from memory pressure, resulting in denial of service or stalled communication (**CWE-400**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the analysis focused on the symptoms of the vulnerability, such as stalled communication. However, by examining the root cause described as the TCP stack not handling window advertisements correctly under extreme memory pressure, it became clear that the issue stems from **improper** resource management. This aligns with **CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling)**, which describes the allocation of resources without proper limits.\n\nThe description mentions \"extreme memory squeeze situations\" and the algorithm consistently fails to advertise a non-zero window once enough memory has been freed. This indicates the system's **inability** to handle resource allocation under stress. The \"not send any data to resolve the situation\" impact further indicates resource exhaustion and the inability to recover which is **CWE-400 (Improper Resource Shutdown or Release)**.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-770** is at the Base level, providing more specific details about the nature of the resource allocation issue, making it more appropriate than a higher-level Class or Pillar.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
