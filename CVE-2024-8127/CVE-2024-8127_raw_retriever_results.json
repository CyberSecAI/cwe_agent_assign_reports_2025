This vulnerability affects the function cgi_unzip of the file /cgi-bin/webfile_mgr.cgi of the component HTTP POST Request Handler. The manipulation of the argument path leads to command injection. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. NOTE This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. NOTE Vendor was contacted early and confirmed that the product is end-of-life. It should be retired and replaced.",
