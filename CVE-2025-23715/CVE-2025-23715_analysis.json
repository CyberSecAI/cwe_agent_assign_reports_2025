The primary focus is on the **cross-site scripting** **weakness** because the description mentions **stored cross-site scripting**.\n\nThe vulnerability description key phrases highlight \"XSS\" and \"stored cross-site scripting\" as weaknesses, supporting the selection of CWE-79. The retriever results also suggest CWE-79 as the top candidate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-79 is at the optimal level of specificity because it is a Base CWE and directly addresses the **rootcause** of the vulnerability: **improper neutralization of input** leading to cross-site scripting.
