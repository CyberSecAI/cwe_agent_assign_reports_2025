The description explicitly states the vulnerability is a **blind time-based SQL injection** due to **insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query** |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-89, which is a Base level CWE. The retriever results show several Class-level CWEs like CWE-116, CWE-138, CWE-943, and Variant-level CWEs such as CWE-95. The analysis focused on identifying the root cause. CWE-89 is a direct and specific representation of the **SQL Injection** vulnerability described.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe943[\"CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe943\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe943,cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient escaping** of user-supplied parameters and a **lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This leads to the **SQL Injection** vulnerability (CWE-89), which allows unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries to extract sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly states that the Cost Calculator Builder PRO plugin is vulnerable to **blind time-based SQL Injection**. The **root cause** is the **insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient preparation** leading to the injection. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the most relevant CWE. The selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the vulnerability described.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n- CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') is the most relevant and accurately captures the **SQL injection** vulnerability due to **insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient preparation**.\n- CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output was considered because of the mention of **insufficient escaping**, but it is a class-level CWE and not as specific as CWE-89.\n- CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic was considered, but CWE-89 is a more specific child of this class and therefore a better fit.\n- CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection') was considered but is not applicable as the vulnerability is **SQL Injection**, not LDAP Injection.\n- CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection') was considered but is not applicable as the vulnerability is **SQL Injection**, not static code injection.\n- CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') was considered but is not applicable as the vulnerability is due to **insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient preparation**.",
