# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-43714

## Vulnerability Description
The ChatGPT system through 2025-03-30 performs inline rendering of SVG documents (instead of, for example, rendering them as text inside a code block), which enables **HTML injection** within most modern graphical web browsers.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **HTML injection**
- **impact:** execute arbitrary HTML
- **product:** ChatGPT
- **version:** through 2025-03-30

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-43714 based on provided content:

The content from `medium.com_9789da3b_20250624_162327.html` directly references CVE-2025-43714 and provides details beyond the official description (which is currently a placeholder). Here's an extraction of relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

ChatGPT allows storing `<svg>` and `<img>` tags inside code blocks, and these elements are rendered when the chat is reopened or shared via a link.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   HTML injection
*   Potential for phishing attacks
*   Web Cache Deception (implied by the ability to share conversations via links)
*   XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) - specifically, the ability to inject executable SVG code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Attackers can embed clickable messages with malicious URLs.
*   Craft SVGs with epileptic-inducing flashing effects or crashing browser effects.
*   Visual and psychological manipulation of users.
*   Potential for stored XSS due to shareable links.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Injecting malicious SVG or image tags into ChatGPT conversations.
*   Sharing links to conversations containing the malicious code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Ability to interact with ChatGPT and inject code.
*   Ability to share links to ChatGPT conversations.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The article states that link sharing was disabled after the vulnerability was reported, which is a mitigation.  Further mitigation would involve sanitizing or preventing the rendering of potentially harmful tags (like `<svg>` and `<img>`) within code blocks.
