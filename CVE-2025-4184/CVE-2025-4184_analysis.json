  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-4184 Content\n\nThis content **RELATES** to a vulnerability in PCMan FTP Server, specifically a remote buffer overflow. It provides a detailed exploit script and analysis, going beyond the information typically found in a CVE description.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `QUOTE` command handling of PCMan FTP Server version 2.0.7.  The exploit script sends a crafted `QUOTE` command with a payload designed to overwrite the instruction pointer (EIP).\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Buffer Overflow:** The `QUOTE` command does not properly validate the length of the input, allowing an attacker to send a buffer larger than the allocated memory.\n*   **Lack of Input Validation:** Insufficient input validation on the `QUOTE` command allows for arbitrary code execution.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system. The script demonstrates achieving this by overwriting EIP and redirecting execution to a shellcode payload.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Remote:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via the FTP protocol.\n*   **Network:** Requires network connectivity to the target FTP server.\n*   **Specific Command:** Exploitation is achieved by sending a specially crafted `QUOTE` command.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target FTP server on port 21.\n*   **Exploit Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of buffer overflow exploitation techniques and the target architecture (x86 in this case).\n*   **Payload Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a shellcode payload compatible with the target system.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not explicitly state a fix. However, the root cause indicates that proper input validation and bounds checking on the `QUOTE` command input are necessary to mitigate the vulnerability.  Updating to a patched version of PCMan FTP Server is the recommended solution.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **Version Specificity:** The exploit is confirmed to work on PCMan FTP Server version 2.0.7.\n*   **Tested Environment:** The exploit was tested on Windows XP SP3.\n*   **Offset and EIP:** The script identifies an offset of 2005 bytes and an EIP address of `0x74e32fd9` (JMP ESP) for exploitation.\n*   **Shellcode Generation:** The script uses `msfvenom` to generate a shellcode payload.\n*   **Bad Characters:** The script defines bad characters (`\\x00\\x0a\\x0d`) that need to be avoided in the payload.\n*   **Exploit Script:** A complete Perl exploit script is provided, demonstrating the steps to connect to the FTP server, authenticate, and send the malicious `QUOTE` command.\n*   **Detailed Payload:** The script includes the exact byte sequence of the payload used for exploitation.",

CWE-119 is a broader class that includes CWE-120. The selection of CWE-120 is based on the explicit mention of a \"buffer overflow\" and the root cause being the lack of size checking during a buffer copy operation.
