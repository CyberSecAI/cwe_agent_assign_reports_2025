A vulnerability has been identified in Redlib where an attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DOS) condition by submitting a specially crafted base2048-encoded DEFLATE decompression bomb to the restore_preferences form. This leads to excessive memory consumption and potential system instability, which can be exploited to disrupt Redlib instances. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.36.0. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-789 CWE-126 CWE-770 CWE-190 CWE-1333 CWE-400 CWE-407 CWE-918 CWE-409",
