## Vulnerability Description
The Appointment Booking Calendar - Simply Schedule Appointments Booking Plugin WordPress plugin before 1.6.7.43 does not escape template syntax provided via user input, leading to **Twig Template Injection** which further exploited can result to remote code Execution by high privilege such as admins

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **Twig Template Injection**
- **impact:** remote code execution
- **product:** Appointment Booking Calendar - Simply Schedule Appointments Booking Plugin WordPress plugin
- **version:** before 1.6.7.43

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The WordPress plugin "Appointment Booking Calendar" fails to properly sanitize user-provided input in the notification message field, specifically template syntax. This allows for Twig template injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Template Injection:** The plugin uses the Twig templating engine, but does not escape or sanitize user input within the message field of notifications. This allows an attacker to inject malicious template code.
*  **Command Injection:** The injected Twig template code can be used to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running the WordPress instance. This can lead to complete compromise of the server and the website it hosts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious Twig template code into the "Message" field when creating or editing a notification in the plugin's settings.
*   Specifically, the "Live Preview" section of the notification settings processes the injected code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs administrative access (or higher privileges) to the WordPress site in order to access the settings page of the plugin, add/modify notifications and inject the malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of the "Appointment Booking Calendar" plugin prior to 1.6.7.43.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the vulnerability using various payloads that could achieve command execution.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a Command Injection (CWE-78) and OWASP Top 10 Injection (A1).
*   The CVSS score is 6.6 (Medium) which is based on the complexity of the exploit, the required privilege to perform the attack and the potential impact
*   The vulnerability was discovered and submitted by Jeewan Kumar Bhatta.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set ‚Äì Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* üîç *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* üîç *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion ‚Äì CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### üî∏ CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúA user created with the ‚Äòguest‚Äô role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúThe backup service runs as root but only needs read access.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### üî∏ CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúUser can access another user‚Äôs invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.‚Äù*

## Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *‚ÄúUser can escalate privileges to admin.‚Äù*
> ‚ùå Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged ‚Äì only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ‚úÖ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

## Good Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privileges & Permissions

* ‚úÖ **CWE-266**: *‚ÄúWhen a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.‚Äù*
* ‚úÖ **CWE-250**: *‚ÄúInstaller runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.‚Äù*
* ‚úÖ **CWE-284**: *‚ÄúInconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.‚Äù*
* ‚úÖ **CWE-285**: *‚ÄúAuthorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.‚Äù*
