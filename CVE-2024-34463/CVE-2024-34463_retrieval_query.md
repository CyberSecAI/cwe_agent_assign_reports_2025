## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-34463:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient security in the Bluetooth communication between the BPL Smart Weighing Scale PWS-01-BT and its associated mobile application. The scale broadcasts weight data via a Bluetooth beacon instead of establishing a secure, direct connection, which leads to exposure of the data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Bluetooth Communication:** The scale uses a publicly broadcasted Bluetooth beacon to transmit weight data without any encryption or authentication.
*   **Lack of Pairing/Authentication:**  The device does not require any pairing or authentication before transmitting the data.
*   **Cleartext Data Transmission:** Weight data is transmitted in cleartext within the beacon, making it easy to intercept and decode.
*   **Predictable Data Format:** The data format within the beacon is consistent and readily reverse-engineered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker within Bluetooth range can passively intercept weight data of any user using the device.
*   **Privacy Violation:**  The user's weight data, which is considered personal and private, can be captured and potentially misused.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Bluetooth Sniffing:** An attacker can use a Bluetooth sniffer to intercept the broadcasted beacons from the weighing scale.
*   **Custom Receiver Application:** The attacker can write a program (as shown in the provided code) to scan for the beacons, decode the weight data, and display it without the user's knowledge or consent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Physical Proximity:** The attacker must be within Bluetooth range (approximately 10 meters) of the scale.
*   **Bluetooth Sniffing Tools:** The attacker needs a device with Bluetooth capability and the ability to sniff Bluetooth traffic (e.g., a laptop with a Bluetooth adapter).
*   **Technical Skills:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of Bluetooth communication, reverse engineering, and programming skills to capture and decode the data.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided content includes a C program to scan for Bluetooth beacons and a Python script to extract weight data from the captured beacons, demonstrating a practical exploit.
*   The provided code effectively turns a standard Linux machine into a passive sniffer for this scale.

This analysis provides more detail than a placeholder CVE description and clearly explains the vulnerability.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

### Extended Description


Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.


Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels, supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such adversaries.


When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

### Extended Description


Because the information is stored in cleartext (i.e., unencrypted), attackers could potentially read it. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.


When organizations adopt cloud services, it can be easier for attackers to access the data from anywhere on the Internet.


In some systems/environments such as cloud, the use of "double encryption" (at both the software and hardware layer) might be required, and the developer might be solely responsible for both layers, instead of shared responsibility with the administrator of the broader system/environment.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**

### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** Different people use "cleartext" and "plaintext" to mean the same thing: the lack of encryption. However, within cryptography, these have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily human-readable (such as base64 encoding).



### Observed Examples

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2019-9805:** Chain: Creation of the packet client occurs before initialization is complete (CWE-696) resulting in a read from uninitialized memory (CWE-908), causing memory corruption.
- **CVE-2007-5191:** file-system management programs call the setuid and setgid functions in the wrong order and do not check the return values, allowing attackers to gain unintended privileges
- **CVE-2007-1588:** C++ web server program calls Process::setuid before calling Process::setgid, preventing it from dropping privileges, potentially allowing CGI programs to be called with higher privileges than intended




## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

### Extended Description
The lack of proper data encryption passes up the guarantees of confidentiality, integrity, and accountability that properly implemented encryption conveys.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-693

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Consider children CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information or CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** There is an overlapping relationship between insecure storage of sensitive information (CWE-922) and missing encryption of sensitive information (CWE-311). Encryption is often used to prevent an attacker from reading the sensitive data. However, encryption does not prevent the attacker from erasing or overwriting the data.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2009-2272:** password and username stored in cleartext in a cookie
- **CVE-2009-1466:** password stored in cleartext in a file with insecure permissions
- **CVE-2009-0152:** chat program disables SSL in some circumstances even when the user says to use SSL.
