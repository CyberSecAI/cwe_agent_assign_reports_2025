# Vulnerability Description

    An improper **input validation vulnerability** is identified in the End of Life (EOL) OVA based connect component which is deployed for installation purposes in the customer internal network. This EOL component was deprecated in September 2023 with end of support extended till January 2024. Under certain circumstances, an actor can manipulate a specific request parameter and inject code execution payload which could lead to a remote code execution on the infrastructure hosting this component.
