An attacker would need to get a logged-in admin to open a page containing the malicious form.\n    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires an authenticated administrator to be tricked into opening a crafted page containing the exploit.\n    *   **Mitigation or fix:** Fixed in version 2.6.1.\n*   **References:** Mentions CVE-2024-8286, also references OWASP Top 10 (A2: Broken Authentication and Session Management) and CWE-352.\n*   **Additional Detail:** Provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) code demonstrating the attack.  Includes details about the affected plugin, the CVSS score, and the researcher/submitter details.\n\n**Content from www.owasp.org_acaab8f6_20250624_205838.html (text)**\n\n*   **Result:** UNRELATED\n\n**Summary of Analysis:**\n\nThe content from `wpscan.com_2857f833_20250624_172434.html` is **relevant** as it directly describes a vulnerability related to CVE-2024-8286, providing detailed information about the vulnerability, its impact, and potential exploitation. It also includes a Proof of Concept (PoC). It provides more details than the official CVE description.",
