{
  "query": "An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability exists in the `upload-link` endpoint of mintplex-labs/anything-llm. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) by shutting down the server through sending invalid upload requests. Specifically, the server can be made to shut down by sending an empty body with a Content-Length 0 header or by sending a body with arbitrary content, such as asdasdasd, with a Content-Length 9 header. The vulnerability is reproducible by users with at least a Manager role, sending a crafted request to any workspace. This issue indicates that a previous fix was not effective in mitigating the vulnerability.",
