  "description": "An **uncontrolled resource consumption** vulnerability exists in the `upload-link` endpoint of mintplex-labs/anything-llm. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) by shutting down the server through sending invalid upload requests. Specifically, the server can be made to shut down by sending an empty body with a Content-Length 0 header or by sending a body with arbitrary content, such as asdasdasd, with a Content-Length 9 header. The vulnerability is reproducible by users with at least a Manager role, sending a crafted request to any workspace. This issue indicates that a previous fix was not effective in mitigating the vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, it appears that the commit `e2439c6d4c3cfdacd96cd1b7b92d1f89c3cc8459` in the `anything-llm` repository involves changes to the `server/endpoints/workspaces.js` file. Specifically, it removes an exception handler for the patch endpoint related to file and link uploads.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe commit removes a `try...catch` block surrounding the code that processes document uploads and link uploads. This means that if an error occurs during the processing of a document or link, the application will no longer catch the error and handle it gracefully, potentially leading to an unhandled exception and application crash.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Lack of proper error handling for file and link processing.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Denial of Service (DoS): If an error occurs, the application may crash due to the unhandled exception, leading to service unavailability.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Malicious or corrupted file uploads.\n- Malicious links that trigger errors during processing.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to upload files or provide links to the application, and these inputs should be able to trigger an error during the processing step. This could be an authenticated user with the appropriate permissions.\n\nThis commit introduces a vulnerability by removing exception handling and exposing the application to unhandled errors.",

The vulnerability description clearly states the **uncontrolled resource consumption** due to sending invalid upload requests, which aligns well with CWE-770's description of allocating resources without restrictions.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a lack of resource control, specifically, CWE-770 (**Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**). This leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption**, and ultimately to denial of service (DoS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-770 as the primary weakness due to the **lack of limits or throttling** on resource allocation. This aligns with the vulnerability description, which highlights that sending invalid upload requests can shut down the server. The commit analysis further supports this, noting the removal of exception handling, exacerbating the resource consumption issue.\n\nThe retriever results showed CWE-400, CWE-1284, and CWE-789 as potential candidates. While CWE-400 (**Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**) is relevant, it's a class-level CWE, and CWE-770 provides more specific information about the root cause. CWE-1284 (**Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input**) and CWE-789 (**Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value**) were considered but deemed less relevant because the vulnerability isn't directly tied to input validation or memory allocation size, but rather the absence of limits.\n\nThe final decision to map CWE-770 as the primary CWE is based on its accurate representation of the weakness and its base-level abstraction, as well as the evidence from the vulnerability description. CWE-400 is a secondary candidate because it is a more general description of the impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs.
