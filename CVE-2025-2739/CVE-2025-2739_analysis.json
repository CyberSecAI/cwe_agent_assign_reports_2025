The impact is direct, where a remote attacker can manipulate the 'sertitle' argument to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which clearly states that the manipulation of the argument 'sertitle' leads to **sql injection** in the `/admin/manage-services.php` file of the PHPGurukul Old Age Home Management System 1.0.\n\nThe evidence from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section confirms the presence of **sql injection**. The retriever results also list CWE-89 as the top candidate with a score of 1.0, further reinforcing this choice.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command.",
