  "description": "Picotls is a TLS protocol library that allows users select different crypto backends based on their use case. When parsing a spoofed TLS handshake message, picotls (specifically, bindings within picotls that call the crypto libraries) may attempt to free the same memory twice. This **double free** occurs during the disposal of multiple objects without any intervening calls to malloc Typically, this triggers the malloc implementation to detect the error and abort the process. However, depending on the internals of malloc and the crypto backend being used, the flaw could potentially lead to a **use-after-free** scenario, which might allow for arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability is addressed with commit 9b88159ce763d680e4a13b6e8f3171ae923a535d.",

No special privileges are required, nor does the attack require any user interaction.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of a spoofed TLS handshake message.\n- The vulnerability exists in the bindings within picotls that call the crypto libraries.\n- The vulnerability was patched in commit `9b88159` and above in the `picotls` repository.\n- The CVSS v3 score is 8.6, indicating a high severity vulnerability.\n- The vulnerability was reported by Kian Kai Ang ([@QUICTester](https://github.com/QUICTester)).",
