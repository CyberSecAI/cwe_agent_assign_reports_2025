  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-45618 Content\n\nBased on the provided content, this relates to an **Incorrect Access Control** vulnerability.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation and improper handling of path traversal in the `/admin/sys/datasource/ajaxList` API endpoint. Specifically, appending `;/../` to the endpoint allows bypassing authentication.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The application fails to properly restrict access to sensitive data or functionality.\n*   **Path Traversal:** The application is vulnerable to path traversal attacks, allowing an attacker to access resources outside the intended directory.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Information Leakage:**  Bypassing authentication allows unauthorized access to data returned by the `/admin/sys/datasource/ajaxList` API.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests.\n*   Specifically, sending a crafted GET request to `/admin/login;/../sys/datasource/ajaxList` bypasses authentication.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target application.\n*   Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint (`/admin/sys/datasource/ajaxList`) and the path traversal payload (`;/../`) is required.\n*   A valid session cookie (JSESSIONID, ycyintang.session.id, shiro-sessionId) is needed to initially appear authenticated, but the path traversal bypasses further checks.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not provide specific mitigation or fix details. However, the root cause suggests the following:\n\n*   **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation to prevent path traversal attempts.\n*   **Access Control:** Strengthen access control mechanisms to ensure that users only have access to authorized resources.\n*   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.\n\n**More detail than official CVE description:**\n\nYes, the content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It includes:\n\n*   Specific API endpoint affected (`/admin/sys/datasource/ajaxList`).\n*   The exact payload used for exploitation (`/admin/login;/../sys/datasource/ajaxList`).\n*   Example HTTP request headers.\n*   Screenshots illustrating the successful bypass.\n*   Affected version information (<= 0.0.1.RELEASE).",

The secondary weakness is **CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**, which is used because the attack vector involves path traversal to bypass authentication.

This leads to **CWE-862 Missing Authorization**, where the application fails to properly authorize the request after the authentication bypass. The final impact is unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is **CWE-862 Missing Authorization** because the root cause of the vulnerability is that the application does not properly check whether the user is authorized to access the resource after the authentication is bypassed due to path traversal (**CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**). The \"**Incorrect access control**\" mentioned in the vulnerability description aligns with **CWE-862**. The vulnerability description and CVE reference summary provide sufficient evidence to support this classification. The guidance clearly distinguishes between authentication and authorization, and since the issue occurs after a bypass of authentication, **CWE-862** is the more appropriate choice.\n\n**CWE-284 Improper Access Control** was considered, but it is a more general CWE, and since we can pinpoint the problem to a missing authorization check after authentication bypass, **CWE-862** is more specific and appropriate.\n\n**CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function** was considered, but this CWE is more suited when there is no authentication required at all, rather than when an authentication bypass occurs.\n\n**CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization** was considered, but the checks are not performed at all, making **CWE-862** a better fit.\n\nThe evidence for **CWE-862** is: \"**Incorrect access control** in the component /admin/sys/datasource/ajaxList of jeeweb-mybatis-springboot v0.0.1.RELEASE allows attackers to access sensitive information via a crafted payload.\"\n\nThe evidence for **CWE-22** is: \"The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation and improper handling of path traversal in the `/admin/sys/datasource/ajaxList` API endpoint.
