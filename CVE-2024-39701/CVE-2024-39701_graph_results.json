It evaluates empty arrays as valid so expressions like {role {_in $CURRENT_USER.some_field}} would evaluate to true allowing the request to pass. This results in Broken Access Control because the rule fails to do what it was intended to do Pass rule if **field** matches any of the **values**. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.6.0.",
