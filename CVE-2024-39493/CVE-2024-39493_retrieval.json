Furthermore its still possible that the caller has not yet called wait_for_completion, resulting in another potential UAF. Fix this by making the caller use cancel_work_sync and then freeing the memory safely.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'Use of completion_done without proper check', 'weakness': ['Use-After-Free (UAF)', 'memory leak'], 'impact': '', 'vector': '', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'Linux kernel', 'version': '', 'component': 'crypto qat'}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**Root Cause:**\\nThe vulnerability stems from a race condition and potential use-after-free (UAF) scenario in the QAT (QuickAssist Technology) driver's device reset mechanism. The driver was using `completion_done()` to check if a caller had gone away after requesting a device reset. However, this check was flawed because it could return true even if the caller had not yet called `wait_for_completion()`, potentially leading to a UAF if the reset data was prematurely freed.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\\n- **Race Condition:** The core issue is a race between the device reset worker and the caller that initiated the reset. The `completion_done()` check was not sufficient to ensure the caller was done with the reset data.\\n- **Use-After-Free (UAF):** If the reset worker freed the `reset_data` structure prematurely, and the caller later tried to access it after a timeout or other delay, it could result in a UAF vulnerability.\\n- **Memory Leak:** The original code could leak `reset_data` if `schedule_reset()` timed out because it would free `reset_data` in the calling function but then return an error code.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n- A UAF could lead to system instability, crashes, or potentially arbitrary code execution by a local attacker.\\n- Memory leaks could cause resource exhaustion and degrade performance over time.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- The attack vector is triggering an error condition that causes a device reset in the QAT driver, specifically targeting the synchronous reset path (`ADF_DEV_RESET_SYNC`).\\n- An attacker would need to create a scenario where the device reset takes longer than expected, which triggers the timeout.\\n- A local attacker with access to QAT devices could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- Local access to a system with a QAT device.\\n- Ability to trigger device reset conditions or manipulate the system into situations that lead to device resets, specifically using `ADF_DEV_RESET_SYNC` mode.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n\\nThe provided patches address this issue by:\\n\\n1.  Replacing `completion_done()` checks with `cancel_work_sync()` to ensure the work queue associated with the reset is canceled and to prevent the race condition.\\n2.  Ensuring that the `reset_data` is freed safely using `kfree()` in both the timeout and completion paths, addressing the potential UAF and memory leak.\\n\\nThe commit messages consistently mention that this change fixes a memory leak and a potential UAF, referencing the original commit that introduced the problematic logic. They also note that the fix applies to kernel versions 6.8 and later.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '362', 'name': \"Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:Use of completion_done without proper check', 'keyphrase': 'Use of completion_done without proper check', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:Use-After-Free (UAF)', 'keyphrase': 'Use-After-Free (UAF)', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:memory leak', 'keyphrase': 'memory leak', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:Linux kernel', 'keyphrase': 'Linux kernel', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'component:crypto qat', 'keyphrase': 'crypto qat', 'type': 'component'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(347.41315048930915)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '367', 'name': 'Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': \"The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
