# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-39493

# Vulnerability Description

    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved crypto qat - Fix ADF_DEV_RESET_SYNC **memory leak** Using completion_done to determine whether the caller has gone away only works after a complete call. Furthermore its still possible that the caller has not yet called wait_for_completion, resulting in another potential UAF. Fix this by making the caller use cancel_work_sync and then freeing the memory safely.

    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'Use of completion_done without proper check'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 347.41)

The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently....

The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state....

### 3. CWE-667: Improper Locking (Score: 320.04)

The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors....

The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors....

### 4. CWE-416: Use After Free (Score: 300.24)

The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer vali...
