## Vulnerability Description
Werkzeug is a Web Server Gateway Interface web application library. Applications using `werkzeug.formparser.MultiPartParser` corresponding to a version of Werkzeug prior to 3.0.6 to parse `multipart/form-data` requests (e.g. all flask applications) are vulnerable to a relatively simple but effective **resource exhaustion** (denial of service) attack. A specifically crafted form submission request can cause the parser to allocate and block 3 to 8 times the upload size in main memory. There is no upper limit a single upload at 1 Gbit/s can exhaust 32 GB of RAM in less than 60 seconds. Werkzeug version 3.0.6 fixes this issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **resource exhaustion**
- **impact:** denial of service
- **vector:** specifically crafted form submission request
- **product:** Werkzeug
- **version:** prior to 3.0.6
- **component:** werkzeug.formparser.MultiPartParser

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2024-49767:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Werkzeug, a Python web library, handles `multipart/form-data` requests. A specially crafted form body can bypass the `Request.max_form_memory_size` setting, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Bypass of `max_form_memory_size`:** The core issue is that the `max_form_memory_size` setting, designed to limit the memory used when parsing form data, can be circumvented. This setting is intended to limit the size of individual (data) parts in a multipart form.
- **Incomplete Resource Limitation:** While `Request.max_content_length` and deployment-level resource limits exist, they are not sufficient to mitigate this specific vulnerability which bypasses the `max_form_memory_size` setting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation can lead to a denial of service, as the server consumes excessive resources parsing the malicious form data and it is unable to serve legitimate requests. The vulnerability is classified as a moderate severity issue, with a CVSS v4 score indicating a low impact on availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is over the network (AV:N), meaning an attacker can exploit this remotely, without needing any special network access.
- **Multipart Form Data:** The attack involves sending a specially crafted `multipart/form-data` request that bypasses the memory limits.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required (PR:N):** An attacker does not need any special access or privileges to trigger the vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction Required (UI:N):** The attack requires no interaction from a user other than sending the malicious request.
- **Low Attack Complexity (AC:L):** The attack is of low complexity, meaning it is relatively easy to perform.

**Technical Details:**
- The fix involves applying the `max_form_memory_size` check not only in the `MultipartDecoder` (which handles individual events) but also in the `MultiPartParser` (which handles parsing the entire stream) to properly limit memory usage across multiple data events.
- The fix is implemented in Werkzeug version 3.0.6 and Quart version 0.19.7.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is identified as GHSA-q34m-jh98-gwm2 in GitHub advisories.
- NetApp products that use Werkzeug are also affected, and NetApp has released an advisory (NTAP-20250103-0007) for the vulnerability, listing affected products.
- The fix for this vulnerability was also implemented in the Quart framework.

In summary, this vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service by sending a crafted multipart form request that bypasses memory limits. The fix involves applying stricter checks on memory usage during form parsing.
