  "description": "Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Starting in version 2.17.0 and prior to version 2.19.1, a flaw in the authentication bypass logic allows unauthenticated requests to match certain unanchored regex patterns in the URL. Attackers can craft URLs containing substrings like /api/items/1/cover in a query parameter (?r=/api/items/1/cover) to partially bypass authentication or trigger server crashes under certain routes. This could lead to information disclosure of otherwise protected data and, in some cases, a complete denial of service (server crash) if downstream code expects an authenticated user object. Version 2.19.1 contains a patch for the issue.",

Since the vulnerability explicitly describes a **missing authentication** check for a critical function, CWE-306 is a more specific and accurate representation than its parent, CWE-287. CWE-200 and CWE-1333 were also considered. CWE-200 represents the information disclosure aspect of the vulnerability. CWE-1333 represents the unanchored regex that is used in the flawed logic that is the rootcause of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe1333 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **flaw in the authentication bypass logic** (CWE-306), leading to the ability to craft URLs that bypass authentication. The impact includes information disclosure (CWE-200) and potential denial of service due to server crashes (potentially related to CWE-1333 if inefficient regex is the cause).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly focuses on the provided evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links. The core issue is a **flaw in authentication bypass logic** which directly aligns with the definition of CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function).\n\nThe following is the evidence:\n- Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: \"**rootcause:** **flaw in authentication bypass logic**\"\n- CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"Root cause of vulnerability: A flaw in the authentication bypass logic allows unauthenticated requests to match certain unanchored regex patterns in the URL.\"\n\nThe retriever results also ranked CWE-306 highly, further supporting this selection. The graph relationships confirm that CWE-306 is a more specific child of CWE-287, making it the preferred choice. The selection of CWE-306 is at the optimal level of specificity as it accurately reflects the **missing authentication** for critical functions aspect of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
