# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-4663

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-4663

## Description

The OSM Map Widget for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the id parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.2 due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** insufficient input sanitization and output escaping
- **Weakness:** cross-site scripting
- **Impact:** inject arbitrary web scripts
- **Attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **Product:** OSM Map Widget for Elementor plugin for WordPress
- **Version:** all versions up to and including 1.2.2

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 1.0 | Base | Primary CWE | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship impacting the decision is the direct match of the vulnerability description to the characteristics of CWE-79. While other CWEs were considered, the description specifically points to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**, which directly aligns with CWE-79's focus on improper neutralization of input during web page generation. No other relationships (Parent-Child, Peer, or Chain) significantly alter this direct mapping. The abstraction level of Base for CWE-79 is appropriate as it captures the fundamental weakness.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is straightforward:
1.  **Root Cause:** **Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** within the OSM Map Widget for Elementor plugin.
2.  **Weakness:** This leads directly to CWE-79, Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting').
3.  **Impact:** Allows unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages, which are then executed when a user interacts with the page.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is primarily based on the clear evidence provided in the vulnerability description, specifically the phrase "**insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**". This directly indicates a failure to neutralize user-controllable input, which is the core characteristic of CWE-79.

The graph relationships were less influential in this specific case as the direct match of the root cause to CWE-79 was very strong.

The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability. More general CWEs would not adequately capture the specific nature of the weakness, while more specific variants would require additional evidence that is not present.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.
