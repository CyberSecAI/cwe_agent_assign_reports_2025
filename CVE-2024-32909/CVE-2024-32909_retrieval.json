CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size (Score: 430.18)\n\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow....\n\n### 2. CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 426.48)\n\nA heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc()....\n\n### 3. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 414.63)\n\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to st...\n\n### 4. CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound) (Score: 405.09)\n\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result....\n\n### 5. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 371.26)\n\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties....\n\n## WEAKNESS: 'buffer overflow'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1.
