  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved io_uring fix possible deadlock in io_register_iowq_max_workers() The io_register_iowq_max_workers() function calls io_put_sq_data(), which acquires the sqd->lock without releasing the uring_lock. Similar to the commit 009ad9f0c6ee (io_uring drop ctx->uring_lock before acquiring sqd->lock), this can lead to a potential deadlock situation. To resolve this issue, the uring_lock is released before calling io_put_sq_data(), and then it is re-acquired after the function call. This change ensures that the locks are acquired in the correct order, preventing the possibility of a deadlock.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, the content is related to CVE-2024-41080.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe `io_register_iowq_max_workers()` function in the Linux kernel's io_uring subsystem calls `io_put_sq_data()`, which acquires the `sqd->lock` without releasing the `uring_lock`. This incorrect lock acquisition order can lead to a potential deadlock situation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nThe vulnerability is a deadlock caused by improper lock ordering. Specifically, `uring_lock` is held when trying to acquire `sqd->lock`, whereas `sqd->lock` might be held by another thread trying to acquire `uring_lock`, leading to a deadlock.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nExploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a system deadlock, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe attack vector involves a malicious or compromised process calling the `io_register_iowq_max_workers()` function in a way that triggers the described lock ordering issue.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nThe attacker needs to be able to make system calls to `io_uring` with the capability to register an IOWQ and set the max workers. This means the attacker must have the ability to execute code on the system.\n\n**Additional details:**\nThe provided content includes multiple instances of the fix being applied to different kernel versions, all referencing the same root cause and resolution. The fix involves releasing the `uring_lock` before acquiring the `sqd->lock` and then reacquiring it, ensuring the locks are acquired in a correct order.",
