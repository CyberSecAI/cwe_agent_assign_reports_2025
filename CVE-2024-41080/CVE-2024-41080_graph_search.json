Similar to the commit 009ad9f0c6ee (io_uring drop ctx->uring_lock before acquiring sqd->lock), this can lead to a potential deadlock situation. To resolve this issue, the uring_lock is released before calling io_put_sq_data(), and then it is re-acquired after the function call. This change ensures that the locks are acquired in the correct order, preventing the possibility of a deadlock. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-911 CWE-667 CWE-833 CWE-413 CWE-832 CWE-663 CWE-764 CWE-362",
