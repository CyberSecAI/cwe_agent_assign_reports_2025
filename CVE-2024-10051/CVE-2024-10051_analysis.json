  "description": "Realchar version v0.0.4 is vulnerable to an **unauthenticated denial of service (DoS)** attack. The vulnerability exists in the file upload request handling, where appending characters, such as dashes (-), to the end of a multipart boundary in an HTTP request causes the server to continuously process each character. This leads to excessive resource consumption and renders the service unavailable. The issue is unauthenticated and does not require any user interaction, impacting all users of the service.",

CWE-400 is a class-level CWE that describes the uncontrolled consumption of resources, which is a consequence of CWE-770. CWE-20 is also a class-level CWE that describes improper input validation, a potential cause of the primary weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe770 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe400\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe770\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of multipart boundaries** in the file upload request (**weakness**). Specifically, the server **fails to limit or throttle the allocation of resources** (CWE-770) when processing an HTTP request with a crafted multipart boundary. This leads to **excessive resource consumption** and ultimately results in a **denial of service** (CWE-400). There might be **improper input validation** (CWE-20) involved, but the description primarily highlights the lack of resource control.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **unauthenticated denial of service (DoS)** due to the server's behavior of continuously processing each character in a crafted multipart boundary. The best fit for this vulnerability is CWE-770, Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling, because the root cause is the server allocating resources without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated. This leads directly to the denial-of-service condition.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is: \"appending characters, such as dashes (-), to the end of a multipart boundary in an HTTP request causes the server to continuously process each character. This leads to excessive resource consumption and renders the service unavailable.\"\n\nCWE-400, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, is a related CWE, but it represents the impact rather than the root cause. CWE-20, Improper Input Validation, is a more general weakness and while it may be present, the description focuses on the resource allocation issue.\n\nI considered CWE-789 Memory Allocation with
