  "description": "7-Zip Mark-of-the-Web Bypass Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to **bypass the Mark-of-the-Web protection mechanism** on affected installations of 7-Zip. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of archived files. When extracting files from a crafted archive that bears the Mark-of-the-Web, 7-Zip does not propagate the Mark-of-the-Web to the extracted files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-25456.",

CWE-61 and CWE-59 were considered as more specific aspects of file handling vulnerabilities, particularly concerning symbolic links, but were deemed secondary because the core issue is about resource management.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\"]\n    cwe61[\"CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\"]\n    cwe59[\"CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\"]\n\n    cwe61 -->|RELATED| cwe664\n    cwe59 -->|RELATED| cwe664\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe664 primary\n    class cwe61,cwe59 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper control of a resource** (the Mark-of-the-Web attribute), leading to a **bypass of the Mark-of-the-Web protection mechanism**, ultimately enabling the **execution of arbitrary code**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the Mark-of-the-Web bypass in 7-Zip. The vulnerability description explicitly states that 7-Zip does not propagate the Mark-of-the-Web to extracted files, leading to a bypass of security mechanisms and potential arbitrary code execution.\n\nThe decision to map CWE-664 as the primary CWE is based on the understanding that the core issue is the **improper control of a resource** through its lifetime. The Mark-of-the-Web attribute is a resource that should be managed and propagated correctly during file extraction to maintain security context. The failure to do so directly leads to the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-61 and CWE-59 capture potential aspects of the vulnerability, particularly related to symbolic links and improper link resolution, but they do not fully encompass the broader issue of resource management.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-664 providing a broad, high-level view of the vulnerability, and CWE-61 and CWE-59 offering more specific perspectives related to file handling.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Technical Explanation**: While file access is involved, the **root cause** isn't directly related to link resolution in the traditional sense. The primary issue is the **failure to propagate security attributes** (Mark-of-the-Web) during file extraction, rather than improper handling of symbolic links. This is more about managing resources and their associated metadata.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.

The vulnerability revolves around **failing to maintain security attributes** during file extraction, not exploiting path manipulation techniques.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Technical Explanation**: While the Mark-of-the-Web attribute can be considered sensitive system information, the **root cause** isn't directly about exposure of this information. Instead, it's the **failure to propagate** this information, leading to a security bypass.\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Technical Explanation**: This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is not about making files accessible to external parties.
