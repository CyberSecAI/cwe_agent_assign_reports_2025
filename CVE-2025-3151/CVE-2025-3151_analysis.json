  "reference_content": "CVE-2025-3151 is related to the content. Here's the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nAttackers inject malicious code from the 'user\\_name' parameter and use it directly in SQL queries without appropriate cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nSQL injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nUnauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe '/signup.php' file, specifically the 'user\\_name' parameter. No login or authorization is required.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nNo specific position or privileges are required; the vulnerability is exploitable without authentication.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n1. Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n2. Input validation and filtering.\n3. Minimize database user permissions.\n4. Regular security audits.\n\n**Additional details (more than official CVE description):**\n*   **Vulnerable File:** /signup.php\n*   **VERSION(S):** V1.0\n*   **Vulnerability type:** time-based blind\n*   **Payload Example:** `user_name=2' AND (SELECT 2206 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))kipu) AND 'SGmW'='SGmW&user_email=123@qq.com&user_pass=asd&user_weight=asd&user_age=12&user_contact=12312312356&user_signup=Submit`\n*   **Software Link:** [https://www.sourcecodester.com/sites/default/files/download/pushpam02/MyGym.zip](https://www.sourcecodester.com/sites/default/files/download/pushpam02/MyGym.zip)\n*   **Vendor Homepage:** [https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/15515/gym-management-system-project-php.html](https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/15515/gym-management-system-project-php.html)\n*   **Submitter:** \u738b\u5b66\u5fd7 (Wang Xuezhi)",

There are no clear relationships to other CWEs based on the provided information that warrant inclusion.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **SQL Injection** (**CWE-89**) due to **improper neutralization** of the user\\_name argument.\n2.  **Impact:** Unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the CVE reference. The description clearly states that the vulnerability is due to **SQL Injection** through manipulation of the user\\_name argument. The CVE reference confirms this, stating that attackers inject malicious code from the 'user\\_name' parameter directly into SQL queries without proper validation. The suggested mitigations (prepared statements, input validation) further support this classification.\n\nThe retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the primary candidate, with a score of 1.0.\n\nThe decision to map this vulnerability to CWE-89 is based on direct evidence and confirmed by both the vulnerability description and supporting CVE details. The level of specificity (Base) is appropriate as it directly represents the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
