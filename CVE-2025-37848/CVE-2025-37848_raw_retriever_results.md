# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-37848
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved accel/ivpu Fix PM related deadlocks in MS IOCTLs Prevent runtime resume/suspend while MS IOCTLs are in progress. Failed suspend will call ivpu_ms_cleanup() that would try to acquire file_priv->ms_lock, which is already held by the IOCTLs.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'failed suspend will call ivpu_ms_cleanup() that would try to acquire file_priv->ms_lock', 'which is already held by the IOCTLs'
