  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5657:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe CraftCMS Two-Factor Authentication plugin (versions 3.3.1 to 3.3.3) was exposing the password hash of the currently authenticated user in the server's response after a successful TOTP submission.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Exposure of Sensitive Attributes:** The plugin was unintentionally revealing the user's password hash in the JSON response after a successful two-factor authentication. This violates the principle of least privilege, as the hash should not be accessible.\n*   **Authorization Vulnerability:**  The exposure of password hash allows an attacker, who has already compromised a user session, to potentially gain unauthorized access by cracking the hash and reusing the credentials elsewhere.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Password Hash Disclosure:** An attacker with a valid session of a user can obtain the user's password hash.\n*   **Potential Account Takeover:** By cracking the password hash, an attacker could gain full control of the user's account, disable MFA, establish new sessions, and perform unauthorized actions.\n*   **Credential Stuffing:**  The attacker could use the disclosed password hash (or the cracked password) in credential stuffing attacks against other services where the victim might have reused their password.\n*   **Prolonged Access:**  The attacker might be able to access the account beyond the current session lifetime by using the cracked password.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Compromised Session:** The attacker needs to gain control of an active user session (e.g., through session hijacking).\n*   **TOTP submission:** The attacker needs to successfully submit a valid TOTP after compromising the session to trigger the disclosure.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **Session hijacking:** The attacker must be able to obtain or hijack a valid user session.\n*   **Ability to disable/re-enable 2FA:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the plugin to disable and re-enable two-factor authentication and trigger the hash disclosure.\n*   **Access to the vulnerable plugin endpoint:** The attacker needs to send requests to the vulnerable plugin endpoints `/index.php?p=admin%2Factions%2Ftwo-factor-authentication%2Fsettings%2Fturn-on` or `/index.php?p=admin%2Factions%2Ftwo-factor-authentication%2Fverify%2Flogin-process`.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.3.4 of the plugin.\n*   The issue was present in versions 3.3.1, 3.3.2, and 3.3.3.\n*   The plugin is no longer maintained and users are advised to use Craft's native 2FA.\n*   The vulnerability was assigned a CVSS base score of 3.7 (Low).\n*   The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2022-37783.\n\nThis analysis provides a more detailed picture of the vulnerability beyond the basic CVE description.",

While CWE-256 specifically addresses the storage of passwords in plaintext, CWE-522 is a broader category encompassing various methods of insufficiently protecting credentials.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **exposure of the password hash** in the server response, leading to potential account takeover and credential stuffing.\n\nRoot Cause: **Exposure of Sensitive Attributes**, specifically the password hash.\nWeakness: The **password hash is disclosed** after successful TOTP submission.\nImpact: Potential account takeover, credential stuffing, and prolonged access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **exposure of the password hash** after successful TOTP submission.\nCWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) is selected because the server response is exposing the password hash. Although it's a hash, the vulnerability description implies that this hash should not have been exposed in the first place. The exposure of the hash is a form of **insufficient protection of credentials**. Thus, CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is also considered, as the hash is sensitive information that should be protected.\n\nThe vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary explicitly state that the password hash is being disclosed.\n\"The CraftCMS plugin Two-Factor Authentication in versions 3.3.1, 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 **discloses the password hash** of the currently authenticated user after submitting a valid TOTP.\"\n\"The plugin was unintentionally revealing the user's password hash in the JSON response after a successful two-factor authentication.\"\n\nWhile the password hash is not the password itself, exposing the hash without proper protection is still a significant security risk. It's also similar to transmitting credentials in cleartext which is why CWE-319 is also considered.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* While authentication is involved, the core issue is the exposure of the password hash, not the weakness of the authentication mechanism itself.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* This CWE is not applicable because the issue isn't the use of weak credentials but the **exposure of the existing password hash**.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* The description does not suggest an incorrect implementation of the authentication algorithm.
