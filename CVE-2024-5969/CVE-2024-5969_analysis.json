  "description": "The AIomatic - Automatic AI Content Writer for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary email sending vulnerability in versions up to, and including, 2.0.5. This is due to **insufficient limitations on the email recipient and the content** in the aiomatic_send_email function which are reachable via AJAX. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send emails with any content to any recipient.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient limitations on the email recipient and content within the `aiomatic_send_email` function, which is accessible via AJAX.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Improper Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation and sanitization of user-supplied inputs, specifically for email recipients and the email body. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary data into these fields.\n*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerable function can be accessed via AJAX without requiring authentication, meaning an attacker does not need to log in or have any valid user account on the WordPress site.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary Email Sending:**  An unauthenticated attacker can send emails with arbitrary content to any recipient they choose. This could be used for:\n    *   Spamming: Sending unsolicited emails to large lists of users.\n    *   Phishing: Sending emails designed to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information.\n    *   Malware Distribution: Sending emails containing malicious attachments or links.\n    *   Reputation Damage: Spoofing emails from the vulnerable domain to damage trust.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **AJAX Request:** The attacker exploits the vulnerable AJAX endpoint (`aiomatic_send_email`).\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any valid user credentials for the WordPress site.\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable website.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability affects versions of the \"AIomatic - Automatic AI Content Writer\" WordPress plugin up to and including version 2.0.5.\n*   The vulnerability was patched in version 2.0.6.\n*   The vulnerability was discovered by Istv\u00e1n M\u00e1rton of Wordfence.",

This means the application isn't properly checking the email recipient and content.\n\nCWE-20 is a parent of many other CWEs related to specific types of input validation errors.
