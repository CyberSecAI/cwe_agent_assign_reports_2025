# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-9235

## Vulnerability Description
The Mapster WP Maps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to an **insufficient capability check** on the mapster_wp_maps_set_option_from_js() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient capability check**
- **impact:** unauthorized modification of data and privilege escalation
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers with contributor-level access and above
- **product:** Mapster WP Maps WordPress plugin
- **version:** up to and including 1.5.0
- **component:** mapster_wp_maps_set_option_from_js() function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an insufficient capability check in the `mapster_wp_maps_set_option_from_js()` function within the Mapster WP Maps plugin. This function allows for updating arbitrary options on the WordPress site.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authorization:** The core issue is that the `mapster_wp_maps_set_option_from_js()` function lacks proper authorization checks. It only verifies if the user has `edit_posts` capability, which is granted to Contributor-level users and above and is not enough to protect options from modification.
*   **Arbitrary Options Update:** Due to the lack of proper authorization, an attacker can manipulate the `option_name` parameter to update any option within the WordPress database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A contributor-level attacker can exploit this vulnerability to elevate their privileges to administrator by manipulating the `default_role` option and enabling user registration. This allows them to gain full control over the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **Complete Site Takeover:**  By gaining administrative access, the attacker can further manipulate the website, install malicious plugins, inject code, and steal data, potentially leading to complete site compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is network-based and can be performed remotely.
*   **REST API Endpoint:** The vulnerability is exposed through a REST API endpoint provided by the plugin. The `mapster_wp_maps_set_option_from_js()` function is registered as a callback for the `mapster-wp-maps/set-option` endpoint.
*  **Request Parameters:** An attacker can use `GET` request method, and modify `option_name` and `option_value` parameters to update WordPress options.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site with at least Contributor-level access or higher (as they have `edit_posts` capability).
*   **Access to the REST API Endpoint:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable REST API endpoint exposed by the plugin.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.6.0 of the plugin.
*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.5.0.
*   The provided code diff highlights the change from the vulnerable `mapster_wp_maps_set_option` function to a more secure  `mapster_wp_maps_set_tutorial_option` function which only updates a single option.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
