Likely impacts include creation of administrative users and deletion or modification of data in the application database. Data exfiltration via **SQL injection** is not possible using this vulnerability. Successful unauthenticated exploitation requires a Workflow system with anonymous access enabled, otherwise an authenticated user is required. This issue affects all versions of FileCatalyst Workflow from 5.1.6 Build 135 and earlier.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5276:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from a SQL Injection flaw in Fortra FileCatalyst Workflow. Specifically, user-supplied input (`jobID`) is used to construct SQL queries without proper sanitization.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application fails to properly neutralize special elements used in SQL commands, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.\n*   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The application does not adequately validate the user-supplied `jobID` parameter.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   An attacker can modify application data.\n*   Potential creation of administrative users.\n*   Deletion or modification of data within the application database.\n*   Although the advisory states data exfiltration is not possible via this vulnerability, the ability to create admin users and modify data could lead to data compromise.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.\n*   **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** The `JOBID` parameter in various URL endpoints of the FileCatalyst Workflow web application is the attack vector.\n*   Successful unauthenticated exploitation requires a Workflow system with anonymous access enabled, otherwise, an authenticated user is required.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable FileCatalyst Workflow instance.\n*   For unauthenticated exploitation, anonymous access must be enabled on the targeted system, otherwise, an authenticated user is required.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*   The vulnerability affects FileCatalyst Workflow versions 5.1.6 Build 135 and earlier.\n*   A proof-of-concept exploit is provided, demonstrating the ability to add an administrative user by injecting SQL.\n*   The vulnerability was discovered by Tenable Research.\n*   The vendor (Fortra) released a patch in version 5.1.6 Build 139.\n*   The CVSS v3.1 base score is 9.8, indicating a critical severity.\n* The exploit can be executed using a simple HTTP GET request, adding the malicious sql code in the JOBID parameter of the URL.",

  "analysis": "# Summary\n| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The application fails to properly neutralize special elements used in SQL commands, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. |\n| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. The application does not adequately validate the user-supplied `jobID` parameter. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that impacted the decision was the parent-child relationship between CWE-20 and more specific input validation CWEs. While CWE-20 is a valid consideration, the presence of SQL Injection (CWE-89) strongly suggests that the root cause is the improper handling of special elements within the SQL query, rather than a general lack of input validation. Thus, CWE-89 is the more specific and appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of special elements in the SQL command (CWE-89), which allows for **SQL injection**. This leads to the ability to modify application data, create administrative users, and delete or modify data in the application database. The missing link is proper input validation (CWE-20) which could have prevented the injection from occurring.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-89 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of **SQL injection** in the vulnerability description. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section clearly states that user-supplied input is used to construct SQL queries without proper sanitization, which is a key characteristic of CWE-89.\n\nThe retriever results further support this choice, with CWE-89 having the highest relevance score. Other CWEs, such as CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), were considered but ultimately deemed less specific.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description, the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\", and the retriever results. CWE-89 is the most specific and appropriate CWE for this vulnerability, as it directly addresses the root cause: the improper handling of special elements in SQL commands leading to SQL injection. CWE-20, while relevant, is a broader category and less precise than CWE-89 in this context. The selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the **SQL injection** vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
