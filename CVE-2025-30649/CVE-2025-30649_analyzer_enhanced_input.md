# Vulnerability Description

    An Improper **Input Validation vulnerability** in the syslog stream TCP transport of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX240, MX480 and MX960 devices with MX-SPC3 Security Services Card allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker, to send specific spoofed packets to cause a CPU Denial of Service (DoS) to the MX-SPC3 SPUs. Continued receipt and processing of these specific packets will sustain the DoS condition. This issue affects Junos OS * All versions before 22.2R3-S6, * from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S4, * from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3, * from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S4, * from 24.2 before 24.2R1-S2, 24.2R2 An indicator of compromise will indicate the SPC3 SPUs utilization has spiked. For example user@device> show services service-sets summary Service sets CPU Interface configured Bytes used Session bytes used Policy bytes used utilization interface 1 bytes (percent%) sessions (percent%) bytes (percent%) 99.97 % OVLD <<<<<< look for high CPU usage

    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'Input Validation vulnerability'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (Score: 921.47)

The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources....

### 2. CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input (Score: 889.15)

The product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties....

### 3. CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order (Score: 864.86)

The product performs multiple related behaviors, but the behaviors are performed in the wrong order in ways which may produce resultant weaknesses....

### 4. CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime (Score: 856.08)

The product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory....

### 5. CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value (Score: 801.21)

The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated....
