Continued receipt and processing of these specific packets will sustain the DoS condition. This issue affects Junos OS * All versions before 22.2R3-S6, * from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S4, * from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3, * from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S4, * from 24.2 before 24.2R1-S2, 24.2R2 An indicator of compromise will indicate the SPC3 SPUs utilization has spiked.

Continued receipt and processing of these specific packets will sustain the DoS condition. This issue affects Junos OS * All versions before 22.2R3-S6, * from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S4, * from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3, * from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S4, * from 24.2 before 24.2R1-S2, 24.2R2 An indicator of compromise will indicate the SPC3 SPUs utilization has spiked.

CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input (Score: 889.15)\n\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties....\n\n### 3. CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order (Score: 864.86)\n\nThe product performs multiple related behaviors, but the behaviors are performed in the wrong order in ways which may produce resultant weaknesses....\n\n### 4. CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime (Score: 856.08)\n\nThe product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory....\n\n### 5. CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value (Score: 801.21)\n\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated....\n\n## VERSION: 'from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S4'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this VERSION:\n\n### 1.
