  "description": "IrfanView DXF File Parsing Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a **memory corruption** condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24704.",

CWE-20 is a class-level CWE that can be a parent of CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input), which could lead to an out-of-bounds write.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe1284 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (Improper Input Validation), leading to a **memory corruption** condition, and culminating in the ability to execute arbitrary code.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the primary weakness is an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) due to **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-20). The evidence is strong, with explicit mentions of **memory corruption** resulting from improper validation. The retriever results and similar CVE descriptions also support CWE-787 as the primary candidate.
