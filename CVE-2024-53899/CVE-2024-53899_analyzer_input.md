# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-53899

## Vulnerability Description
virtualenv before 20.26.6 allows **command injection** through the activation scripts for a virtual environment. Magic template strings are not quoted correctly when replacing. NOTE this is not the same as CVE-2024-9287.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **product:** virtualenv
- **version:** before 20.26.6

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-53899:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a command injection vulnerability present in the activation script of `virtualenv`. This arises from how the script handles template strings when replacing them with environment-specific values. Specifically, these strings were not properly quoted or sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The core vulnerability is command injection. By crafting a virtual environment path with malicious code embedded, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary shell commands when the activation script is run using `source ./bin/activate` or `. ./bin/activate`.
*   **Unquoted Template Strings:** The script uses template strings for configuration, and these strings were not properly quoted when substituted into shell commands in the activation scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the system with the privileges of the user activating the virtual environment.
*   **Downstream Attack Vectors:** While direct exploitation is considered low risk since the user has to specifically create a malicious env path, it allows the potential for exploiting vulnerable downstream dependencies.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Environment Path:** The primary attack vector involves creating a directory with a name that includes malicious shell commands. For example,  `envname="';uname -a;':"`
*   **Activation Script:** The injected commands are executed when the user activates the virtual environment via `source ./bin/activate` or `. ./bin/activate`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User-Level Access:** The attacker needs to be able to create directories and virtual environments on the target system.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires that the victim user activates the crafted virtual environment.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of this specific injection point within the `virtualenv` activation script.
