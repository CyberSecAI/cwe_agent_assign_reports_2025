Affected devices **store user passwords in plaintext** without proper protection. This could allow a physical attacker to retrieve them from the embedded storage ICs.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **store user passwords in plaintext**
- **impact:** retrieve them from the embedded storage ICs
- **attacker:** physical attacker
- **product:** LOGO! and SIPLUS LOGO!
- **version:** All versions

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the plaintext storage of user-set passwords within the embedded storage IC of the affected Siemens LOGO! V8.3 BM devices.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-256:** Plaintext Storage of a Password. The device stores passwords without any encryption or hashing, making them easily readable if accessed.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker with physical access to the affected device can extract user-set passwords from the embedded storage IC.
*   The extracted passwords could allow unauthorized access and control of the affected device.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The primary attack vector involves gaining physical access to the vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs physical access to the affected LOGO! V8.3 BM or SIPLUS LOGO! V8.3 BM device.
*   The attacker requires the ability to extract data from the embedded storage IC.

**Additional details:**

*   The advisory lists specific affected product versions and their corresponding part numbers.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in newer hardware versions (LOGO! V8.4 BM and SIPLUS LOGO! V8.4 BM).
*   There are no software patches for the vulnerable versions, and mitigation relies on securing physical access to the devices.
*   The advisory also provides a CVSS v3.1 and v4.0 score and vectors for the vulnerability.
