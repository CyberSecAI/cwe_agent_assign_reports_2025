  "description": "**Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm** in Apache Kafkas SCRAM implementation. Issue Summary Apache Kafkas implementation of the Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) **did not fully adhere to the requirements of RFC 5802** [1]. Specifically, as per RFC 5802, the server must verify that the nonce sent by the client in the second message matches the nonce sent by the server in its first message. However, Kafkas SCRAM implementation did not perform this validation. Impact This vulnerability is exploitable only when an attacker has plaintext access to the SCRAM authentication exchange. However, the usage of SCRAM over plaintext is strongly discouraged as it is considered an insecure practice [2]. Apache Kafka recommends deploying SCRAM exclusively with TLS encryption to protect SCRAM exchanges from interception [3]. Deployments using SCRAM with TLS are not affected by this issue. How to Detect If You Are Impacted If your deployment uses SCRAM authentication over plaintext communication channels (without TLS encryption), you are likely impacted. To check if TLS is enabled, review your server.properties configuration file for listeners property. If you have SASL_PLAINTEXT in the listeners, then you are likely impacted. Fix Details The issue has been addressed by introducing nonce verification in the final message of the SCRAM authentication exchange to ensure compliance with RFC 5802. Affected Versions Apache Kafka versions 0.10.2.0 through 3.9.0, excluding the fixed versions below. Fixed Versions 3.9.0 3.8.1 3.7.2 Users are advised to upgrade to 3.7.2 or later to mitigate this issue. Recommendations for Mitigation Users unable to upgrade to the fixed versions can mitigate the issue by - Using TLS with SCRAM Authentication Always deploy SCRAM over TLS to encrypt authentication exchanges and protect against interception. - Considering Alternative Authentication Mechanisms Evaluate alternative authentication mechanisms, such as PLAIN, Kerberos or OAuth with TLS, which provide additional layers of security.",

Verification of CVE Relevance**\n   - The provided content explicitly mentions `CVE-2024-56128` and describes a vulnerability in Apache Kafka's SCRAM implementation, directly relating to the CVE.\n\n**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**\n   - The root cause is an incorrect implementation of the Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) in Apache Kafka.\n   - Specifically, Kafka's implementation failed to verify if the nonce sent by the client in the second message matched the nonce sent by the server in the first message, as required by RFC 5802.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**\n   - **Missing Nonce Verification:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper nonce validation in the SCRAM authentication exchange. According to RFC 5802, the server is supposed to verify that the nonce sent in the client's final message matches the nonce it sent in the initial server response.\n   - This missing validation enables the replay attack.\n\n**4. Impact of Exploitation**\n   - **Replay Attacks:** An attacker who has plaintext access to a SCRAM authentication exchange can potentially reuse the captured messages to impersonate a legitimate user. This can lead to unauthorized access to the system.\n   - It's critical to note this vulnerability is exploitable when the attacker intercepts the handshake in plaintext.\n\n**5. Attack Vectors**\n   - **Plaintext Interception:** The attack vector involves intercepting the SCRAM authentication exchange over a plaintext channel (i.e., without TLS encryption). This is often achievable through network eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**\n   - **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be positioned where they can intercept network traffic between a Kafka client and server.\n   - **Plaintext Access:** The attacker needs to intercept the traffic in plaintext format.\n   - **Knowledge of protocol:** The attacker has to have an understanding of the SCRAM protocol to be able to replay relevant messages\n\n**Additional Technical Details:**\n\n*   **RFC 5802 Compliance:** The vulnerability stems from a deviation from the requirements outlined in RFC 5802, which specifies the SCRAM protocol.\n*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability can be mitigated by:\n    *   **Enforcing TLS:** Always use TLS encryption for SCRAM authentication exchanges to prevent plaintext interception.\n    *   **Upgrading:** Upgrade to Apache Kafka versions 3.7.2, 3.8.1, or 3.9.0, or any later version that includes the fix.\n*   **Affected Kafka Versions:** Versions 0.10.2.0 before 3.7.2 and 3.8.0 of Apache Kafka are affected.\n*   **Server configuration**: Check `server.properties` configuration for listeners property. if `SASL_PLAINTEXT` is part of the listeners, then the instance is likely impacted.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nCVE-2024-56128 describes a replay attack vulnerability in Apache Kafka's SCRAM implementation due to a lack of nonce verification. An attacker with the ability to intercept plaintext SCRAM exchanges can reuse the messages to bypass authentication. The primary mitigation is to use TLS encryption.\n```",
