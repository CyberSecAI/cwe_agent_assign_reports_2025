(Remote Code Execution) For this, the user must be able to create ScriptVars with the type script and preview them by, for example, creating a new Info. By default, admin users have those permissions, but with the granular permission system, those permissions may be assigned to other users. An attacker is able to execute commands on the server running the bestinformed Web application if an account with the correct permissions was compromised before.",
