CWE-352 is a compound weakness, whereas CWE-79 is a Base level weakness. There are no direct relationships between CWE-352 and CWE-79, but in this context, successful exploitation of CWE-352 can lead to CWE-79.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe352 -->|CAN LEAD TO| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability**, which allows an attacker to perform actions on behalf of a user. In this case, the CSRF leads to **Stored XSS**, because the attacker is able to inject malicious code using the CSRF vulnerability, and that code is then stored and executed when another user views the content. Therefore, the chain is: CSRF -> Stored XSS. The **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability** is the first in the \"Vulnerability Chain\".\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability** that leads to **Stored XSS**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms the **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability**. The retriever results also list CWE-352 and CWE-79 as top candidates.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-352 because the root cause of the vulnerability is the **lack of CSRF protection**. This allows an attacker to perform actions on behalf of another user, which in this specific case results in Stored XSS (CWE-79).
