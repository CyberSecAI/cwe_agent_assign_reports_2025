This vulnerability allows attackers to change a victims profile picture without their consent, potentially leading to a denial of service by overloading the filesystem with files. Additionally, this flaw can be exploited to perform a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victims browser session. The issue is resolved in version 9.3. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-359 CWE-116 CWE-79 CWE-472 CWE-1004 CWE-352 CWE-434",
