This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /cgi-bin/mainfunction.cgi/apmcfgupptim of the component Web Management Interface. The manipulation of the argument session leads to os command injection. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 1.5.1.5 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.",
