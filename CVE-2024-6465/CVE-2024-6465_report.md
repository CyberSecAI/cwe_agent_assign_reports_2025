# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-6465

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-6465

## Description

The WP Links Page plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a **missing capability check** on the wplf_ajax_update_screenshots function in all versions up to, and including, 4.9.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to regenerate the links thumbnail image.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** missing capability check
- **Impact:** unauthorized modification of data
- **Attacker:** authenticated attackers
- **Product:** WP Links Page plugin for WordPress
- **Version:** up to and including 4.9.5
- **Component:** wplf_ajax_update_screenshots function

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 1.0 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. |
| CWE-425 | Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is between CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] and its child CWE-425 [Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')]. While CWE-862 is a class-level CWE, CWE-425 is a base-level CWE that is more specific, describing the missing authorization in terms of direct requests to URLs. CWE-862 is selected because it is a broader category that encapsulates the vulnerability, while CWE-425 describes a specific instance of missing authorization related to direct requests.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing capability check** in the `wplf_ajax_update_screenshots` function (CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]), which allows unauthorized users (subscriber-level and above) to directly request and trigger the regeneration of link thumbnails. This leads to the **unauthorized modification of data**.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] as the primary weakness, due to the **missing capability check**. The evidence supporting this is found in the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary": "The `wplf_ajax_update_screenshots` function in the WP Links Page plugin **lacks a proper capability check**. This allows any authenticated user, even with the lowest Subscriber role, to trigger the function."

The retriever results also highlighted CWE-425 [Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')], which is a child of CWE-862. While CWE-425 is a more specific case of missing authorization, I've decided to include it as a secondary CWE because it accurately describes how an authenticated user can directly request the thumbnail regeneration, which is not adequately protected.

The selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] capturing the general lack of authorization and CWE-425 [Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')] capturing the specific attack vector.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-862: Missing Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review

The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
