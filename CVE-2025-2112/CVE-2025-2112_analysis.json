  "description": "A vulnerability was found in user-xiangpeng yaoqishan up to a47fec4a31cbd13698c592dfdc938c8824dd25e4. It has been declared as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is the function getMediaLisByFilter of the file cn/javaex/yaoqishan/service/media_info/MediaInfoService.java. The manipulation of the argument typeId leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This product takes the approach of rolling releases to provide continious delivery. Therefore, version details for affected and updated releases are not available. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

The description explicitly mentions \"**sql injection**\" which aligns perfectly with CWE-89. Other CWEs were considered, but they represent either broader categories (like CWE-74) or different types of vulnerabilities (like CWE-79, CWE-113).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe79 -->|PEEROF| cwe89\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper neutralization** of special elements in SQL commands (CWE-89).\n2.  **Impact:** Remote attacker can manipulate SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based directly on the vulnerability description. The description states that the vulnerability is an \"**sql injection**\" caused by the manipulation of the argument `typeId`. The \"Retriever Results\" confirms that CWE-89 is the best match for this type of vulnerability. The relationship analysis indicates that CWE-89 is a specific type of injection, making it more appropriate than the broader CWE-74. The evidence is clear and directly supports the selection of CWE-89.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
