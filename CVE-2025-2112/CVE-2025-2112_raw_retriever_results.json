Affected by this vulnerability is the function getMediaLisByFilter of the file cn/javaex/yaoqishan/service/media_info/MediaInfoService.java. The manipulation of the argument typeId leads to sql injection. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This product takes the approach of rolling releases to provide continious delivery. Therefore, version details for affected and updated releases are not available. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
