# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-39908

## Vulnerability Description
REXML is an XML toolkit for Ruby. The REXML gem before 3.3.1 has some DoS vulnerabilities when it parses an XML that has many specific characters such as ``. If you need to parse untrusted XMLs, you many be impacted to these vulnerabilities. The REXML gem 3.3.2 or later include the patches to fix these vulnerabilities. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid parsing untrusted XML strings.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **If you need to parse untrusted XMLs you may be impacted to these vulnerabilities**
- **impact:** DoS
- **product:** REXML gem
- **version:** before 3.3.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-39908

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how the REXML gem parses XML documents containing a high number of specific characters such as `<`, `0`, and `%>`. This can lead to excessive processing time.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The core weakness is the inefficient parsing of XML documents with a high concentration of specific characters (`<`, `0`, and `%>`).
- This inefficient parsing leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a denial-of-service by providing a specially crafted XML document to an application using the vulnerable REXML gem.
- The application will become unresponsive or slow due to the excessive processing time, potentially affecting its availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the parsing of malicious XML documents.
- Applications that accept and parse XML from untrusted sources are vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply malicious XML input to an application that uses the vulnerable REXML gem.
- This can be achieved if the application processes XML input from external sources, user uploads, APIs, or any other location the attacker can influence.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is categorized as a low severity issue.
- The issue was discovered by "mprogrammer" and the fix is included in version 3.3.2 of the gem.
- A similar vulnerability is referenced: GHSA-vg3r-rm7w-2xgh
- The official ruby-lang.org advisory provides more details compared to the basic CVE description.
