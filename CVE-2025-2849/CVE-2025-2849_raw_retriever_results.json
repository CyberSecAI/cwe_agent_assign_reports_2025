  "query": "A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in UPX up to 5.0.0. Affected is the function PackLinuxElf64un_DT_INIT of the file src/p_lx_elf.cpp. The manipulation leads to heap-based buffer overflow. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The patch is identified as e0b6ff192412f5bb5364c1948f4f6b27a0cd5ea2. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.",
