CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 252.58)\n\nA heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc()....\n\n### 2. CWE-126: Buffer Over-read (Score: 251.02)\n\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer....\n\n### 3. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 241.48)\n\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties....\n\n### 4. CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write (Score: 240.14)\n\nThe product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....\n\n### 5. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 225.04)\n\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to st...\n\n## WEAKNESS: 'Memory corruption'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1. CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write (Score: 240.14)\n\nThe product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....\n\n### 2. CWE-667: Improper Locking (Score: 236.95)\n\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors....\n\n### 3. CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset (Score: 225.20)\n\nThe product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer....\n\n### 4. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 225.04)\n\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to st...\n\n### 5. CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference (Score: 220.48)\n\nThe product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL....\n\n## COMPONENT: 'camera driver'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this COMPONENT:\n\n### 1. CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write (Score: 240.14)\n\nThe product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....\n\n### 2. CWE-667: Improper Locking (Score: 236.95)\n\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors....\n\n### 3. CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset (Score: 225.20)\n\nThe product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer....\n\n### 4. CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference (Score: 220.48)\n\nThe product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL....\n\n### 5. CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (Score: 71.12)\n\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data....\n\n## ROOTCAUSE: 'use-after-free'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1. CWE-667: Improper Locking (Score: 236.95)\n\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors....\n\n### 2. CWE-415: Double Free (Score: 230.49)\n\nThe product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations....\n\n### 3. CWE-665: Improper Initialization (Score: 225.47)\n\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used....\n\n### 4. CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset (Score: 225.20)\n\nThe product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer....\n\n### 5. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 225.05)\n\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently....\n\n\n    # Analysis Instructions\n    1.
