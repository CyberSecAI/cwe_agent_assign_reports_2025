  "description": "The KiviCare Clinic & Patient Management System (EHR) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the service_list[0][service_id] parameter of the get_widget_payment_options AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.4 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Custom-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11729\n\n**Root Cause:** Insufficient escaping of user-supplied input and lack of sufficient preparation in the existing SQL query. Specifically, the `service_list[0][service_id]` parameter of the `get_widget_payment_options` AJAX action is vulnerable.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code into database queries.\n*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code fails to properly sanitize the `service_list[0][service_id]` parameter, allowing special characters and SQL syntax to be passed directly to the database.\n*   **Insufficient Prepared Statements:** The use of dynamic queries without proper parameterization opens the door for SQL injection attacks.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database by appending malicious SQL queries to existing ones. This could include user data, payment information, or other confidential data.\n*   **Potential Data Modification:** Although the provided information only confirms the ability to extract data, SQL injection vulnerabilities can often also lead to data modification or deletion. (not explicit from given content but typical for SQLi).\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Network:** The attack occurs over the network, through an AJAX request.\n*   **AJAX Action:** The vulnerable parameter resides within the `get_widget_payment_options` AJAX action.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have at least \"subscriber\" level access to WordPress.\n*   **Access to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint:** The attacker needs to be able to send a request to the vulnerable AJAX action with the malicious `service_list[0][service_id]` parameter.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n* The vulnerability is present in KiviCare \u2013 Clinic & Patient Management System (EHR) plugin versions up to and including 3.6.4.\n*   The issue is fixed in version 3.6.5.\n*   The vulnerable code is located in the `KCBookAppointmentWidgetController.php` file\n* The patch involves sanitizing the `service_list_data` by applying `absint` to ensure that the data are integers before using them in SQL queries, and also checking `payment_mode` before setting status\n\nThis information provides more details than the original CVE description, specifically mentioning the vulnerable parameter, the vulnerable AJAX action, and the location of the vulnerable code. It also confirms that this vulnerability allows for data extraction.",

CWE-89 is a Base level CWE which is the preferred level. Several Class level CWEs were considered, such as CWE-138, but they are less specific than CWE-89. The chain relationship wasn't a big factor in this case, but the **lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query** means that SQL injection is possible.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe138[\"CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|PEEROF| cwe425\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe138\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n    class cwe138 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**, leading to the **SQL Injection** vulnerability, which allows authenticated attackers to extract sensitive information from the database.\n  - **Root Cause:** **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**\n  - **Weakness:** **SQL Injection** (CWE-89)\n  - **Impact:** Extract sensitive information from the database\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')). This is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions **SQL injection** due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms that the **root cause** is the lack of input sanitization and the use of dynamic queries, which leads to SQL injection. This CWE is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred. The evidence clearly supports this selection.\n\nCWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) was considered because the attacker needs to be an authenticated user to exploit the **SQL Injection**. However, the primary issue is the **SQL Injection** itself, not the lack of authorization. While authorization might be a contributing factor, the core vulnerability lies in the improper handling of SQL queries.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
