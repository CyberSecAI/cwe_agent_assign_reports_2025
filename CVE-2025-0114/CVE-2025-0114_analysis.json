CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400 and represents a more specific case of uncontrolled resource consumption, where resources are allocated without limits or throttling. The relationship between CWE-400 and CWE-770 influenced the decision to include CWE-770 as a secondary CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an unauthenticated attacker sending a large number of specially crafted packets, leading to **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400), which results in a **denial of service**. The **allocation of resources without limits or throttling** (CWE-770) may further explain the root cause of the uncontrolled resource consumption in GlobalProtect.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the denial of service vulnerability. The evidence clearly points to the ability of an unauthenticated attacker to exhaust resources by sending a large number of packets. The primary CWE, CWE-400, accurately captures this aspect. The inclusion of CWE-770 as a secondary CWE provides additional context regarding the resource allocation aspect of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-400 is based on the vulnerability description, which states that the attacker can render the service unavailable by sending a large number of packets. This aligns with the definition of CWE-400, which describes the product's failure to properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource.\n\nThe evidence is strong, based on the provided vulnerability description and the analysis of CVE-2025-0114. The graph relationships support the inclusion of CWE-770 as a more specific aspect of CWE-400. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-400 providing a general description of the vulnerability and CWE-770 offering a more detailed explanation of the resource allocation aspect.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-406: Insufficient Control of Network Message Volume (Network Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently monitor or control transmitted network traffic volume, so that an actor can cause the product to transmit more traffic than should be allowed for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs.
