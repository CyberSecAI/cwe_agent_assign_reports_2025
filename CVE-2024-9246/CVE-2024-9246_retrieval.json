This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Foxit PDF Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of Annotation objects. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24135.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'lack of proper validation of user-supplied data', 'weakness': ['Information Disclosure Vulnerability', 'Out-Of-Bounds Read'], 'impact': ['Information Disclosure', 'disclose sensitive information', 'execute arbitrary code'], 'vector': 'malicious page or file', 'attacker': 'remote attackers', 'product': 'Foxit PDF Reader', 'version': '', 'component': 'handling of Annotation objects'}, reference_content='Based on the provided content, here\\'s a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-9246:\\n\\n**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\\n\\n*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when handling Annotation objects in Foxit PDF Reader. This lack of validation can lead to a read operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.\\n\\n**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n\\n*   **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the application attempts to read data from a memory location beyond the allocated buffer.\\n*   **Insufficient Data Validation**: The core issue is the insufficient validation of user-provided input.\\n\\n**3. Impact of Exploitation:**\\n\\n*   **Information Disclosure:** The out-of-bounds read can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. The official description states it allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information.\\n*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The advisory also mentions that this vulnerability can be leveraged along with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.\\n\\n**4. Attack Vectors:**\\n\\n*   **Malicious PDF files:** The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a malicious PDF file specifically crafted to exploit the flaw in the processing of Annotation objects.\\n*   **Malicious web pages:** User interaction is required. The target must either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious file to be exploited.\\n\\n**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n\\n*   **Remote Attacker:**  The attacker is remote, meaning they do not require physical access to the victim\\'s system.\\n*   **User Interaction Required:** The attacker requires the user to interact with the malicious content (either opening a file or visiting a page). This is indicated by \"User interaction is required\" within the \"VULNERABILITY DETAILS\" section of the advisory.\\n*   **No Special Privileges:** The attack does not require any specific user privileges on the targeted system (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N).\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n\\n*   The vulnerability is present within the handling of Annotation objects.\\n*   The advisory indicates Foxit has released an update to correct this vulnerability.\\n*   The advisory is also linked to ZDI-24-1299 and ZDI-CAN-24135, which are likely internal identifiers used by Trend Micro\\'s Zero Day Initiative.\\n*   The CVSS score is 3.3, with a vector of AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N. This indicates that it\\'s a low severity, local access, user-interaction-required vulnerability that results in low confidentiality impact.\\n*   The advisory notes that this can be combined with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code.\\n*   This is addressed in multiple Foxit PDF Reader/Editor versions for Windows and Mac, and also in the cloud version of the editor, according to the provided Foxit changelogs.\\n\\nThis content provides a more detailed explanation of the vulnerability than the basic CVE description.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {95: {'cwe_counts':

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    Foxit PDF Reader Annotation **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Foxit PDF Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of Annotation objects. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24135.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'lack of proper validation of user-supplied data'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
