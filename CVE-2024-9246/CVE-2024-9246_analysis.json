  "description": "Foxit PDF Reader Annotation **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Foxit PDF Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of Annotation objects. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24135.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-9246:\n\n**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when handling Annotation objects in Foxit PDF Reader. This lack of validation can lead to a read operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.\n\n**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the application attempts to read data from a memory location beyond the allocated buffer.\n*   **Insufficient Data Validation**: The core issue is the insufficient validation of user-provided input.\n\n**3. Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Information Disclosure:** The out-of-bounds read can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. The official description states it allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information.\n*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The advisory also mentions that this vulnerability can be leveraged along with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.\n\n**4. Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Malicious PDF files:** The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a malicious PDF file specifically crafted to exploit the flaw in the processing of Annotation objects.\n*   **Malicious web pages:** User interaction is required. The target must either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious file to be exploited.\n\n**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Remote Attacker:**  The attacker is remote, meaning they do not require physical access to the victim's system.\n*   **User Interaction Required:** The attacker requires the user to interact with the malicious content (either opening a file or visiting a page). This is indicated by \"User interaction is required\" within the \"VULNERABILITY DETAILS\" section of the advisory.\n*   **No Special Privileges:** The attack does not require any specific user privileges on the targeted system (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N).\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is present within the handling of Annotation objects.\n*   The advisory indicates Foxit has released an update to correct this vulnerability.\n*   The advisory is also linked to ZDI-24-1299 and ZDI-CAN-24135, which are likely internal identifiers used by Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.\n*   The CVSS score is 3.3, with a vector of AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N. This indicates that it's a low severity, local access, user-interaction-required vulnerability that results in low confidentiality impact.\n*   The advisory notes that this can be combined with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code.\n*   This is addressed in multiple Foxit PDF Reader/Editor versions for Windows and Mac, and also in the cloud version of the editor, according to the provided Foxit changelogs.\n\nThis content provides a more detailed explanation of the vulnerability than the basic CVE description.",

This leads to **CWE-125** (Out-of-bounds Read) when the application attempts to read data past the end of an allocated buffer. The impact of the **Out-Of-Bounds Read** is **Information Disclosure**. The vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker through a malicious page or file.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is **CWE-125** (Out-of-bounds Read), which is directly supported by the vulnerability description's mention of an \"**Out-Of-Bounds Read**\". The \"**lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**\" indicates that **CWE-20** (Improper Input Validation) is a contributing factor.\n\nThe relationship analysis shows that **CWE-125** is a child of **CWE-119**, but **CWE-125** is more specific and accurately reflects the vulnerability. **CWE-20** can precede **CWE-125**, forming a chain where improper validation leads to an out-of-bounds read.\n\nI considered **CWE-787** (Out-of-bounds Write), **CWE-122** (Heap-based Buffer Overflow), and **CWE-1284** (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input), but they are not the most appropriate CWEs for this vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**Out-Of-Bounds Read**\", so **CWE-125** is the best match.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available.
