  "query": "CVE-2025-27702 is a vulnerability in the management console of Absolute Secure Access prior to version 13.54. Attackers with administrative access to the console and who have been assigned a certain set of permissions can bypass those permissions to improperly modify settings. The attack complexity is low, there are no preexisting attack requirements the privileges required are high, and there is no user interaction required. There is no impact to system confidentiality or availability, impact to system integrity is high.",
