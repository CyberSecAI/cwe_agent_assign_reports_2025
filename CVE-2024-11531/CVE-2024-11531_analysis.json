  "description": "IrfanView CGM File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Read Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of CGM files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24606.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing CGM files in IrfanView. This improper validation allows a read past the end of an allocated buffer.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to insufficient input validation during CGM file parsing.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The attack requires user interaction.\n- An attacker can exploit this by enticing a user to visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious CGM file.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious CGM file to a user of a vulnerable version of IrfanView. This can be done via web or file delivery.\n- The attacker does not require any special privileges on the user's system.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability is fixed in IrfanView version 4.70 with plugins version 4.70.\n- This vulnerability is identified as ZDI-24-1535 and ZDI-CAN-24606 in addition to CVE-2024-11531.",

The vulnerability description clearly indicates a **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** as the root cause, which directly results in an **out-of-bounds read**. Therefore, CWE-125 is a more specific child of CWE-20.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20), which then leads to an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125). The impact of this is potential remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) was considered due to its high ranking in similar CVE descriptions. However, the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference summary explicitly mention an **out-of-bounds read** vulnerability. The **lack of proper validation** allows the read operation to go beyond the allocated buffer.\nCWE-20 is also included as the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** is the root cause of the vulnerability.\nCWE-125 is chosen as the primary CWE because the description specifically mentions an **out-of-bounds read** resulting from this missing validation. This is more precise than using just CWE-20 or even CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), which is a more general class.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
