There is no more specific child CWE of CWE-401 that applies.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe401 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a **memory leak** due to the **missing release of memory**, leading to potential resource exhaustion.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary, which clearly indicate a **memory leak** in the `parseSWF_PLACEOBJECT3` function due to **improper memory handling**. The primary weakness is the **missing release of memory**, which directly corresponds to CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime).
