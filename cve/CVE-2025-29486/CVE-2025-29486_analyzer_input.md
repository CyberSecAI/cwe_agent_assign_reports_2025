# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-29486

## Vulnerability Description
libming v0.4.8 was discovered to contain a **memory leak** via the parseSWF_PLACEOBJECT3 function.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **memory leak**
- **product:** libming
- **version:** v0.4.8
- **component:** parseSWF_PLACEOBJECT3 function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
Root cause of vulnerability:
*   **bug1**: Out-of-memory error due to allocation of a large block of memory in the `parseABC_NS_SET_INFO` function.
*   **bug2**: Memory leak in `parseSWF_ENABLEDEBUGGER2` where memory allocated for reading strings is not freed.
*   **bug3**: Memory leak in `parseSWF_PLACEOBJECT3` due to improper memory handling when reading strings.
*   **bug4**: Segmentation fault (SEGV) in `decompileRETURN` caused by a READ memory access to an invalid address.
*   **bug5**: Memory leak in `parseSWF_INITACTION` due to improper memory reallocation.
*   **bug6**: Out-of-memory error in `parseABC_STRING_INFO` when allocating a large memory block.
*   **bug7**: Memory leak in `parseSWF_MORPHLINESTYLES` due to improper memory allocation.
*   **bug8**: Segmentation fault (SEGV) in `decompileCALLMETHOD` due to READ memory access to an invalid address.
*   **bug9**: Segmentation fault (SEGV) in `decompileSETVARIABLE` due to READ memory access to an invalid address.
*   **bug10**: Allocation-size-too-big error in `parseSWF_DEFINEBINARYDATA` due to an excessively large memory allocation request.
*   **bug11**: Segmentation fault (SEGV) in `decompileGETPROPERTY` due to READ memory access to an invalid address.
*   **bug12**: Segmentation fault (SEGV) in `decompileGETMEMBER` due to READ memory access to an invalid address.
*   **bug13**: Segmentation fault (SEGV) in `decompileIMPLEMENTS` due to READ memory access to an invalid address.
*   **bug14**: Segmentation fault (SEGV) in `decompileDUPLICATECLIP` due to READ memory access to an invalid address.
*   **bug15**: Memory leak in `parseSWF_MORPHFILLSTYLES` due to improper memory allocation.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
*   Out-of-memory errors leading to application termination or denial of service (DoS).
*   Memory leaks that consume system resources.
*   Segmentation faults (SEGV) that lead to program crashes.

Impact of exploitation:
*   **bug1, bug6**: Denial of Service (DoS) due to allocator exhaustion.
*   **bug2, bug3, bug5, bug7, bug15**: Memory leaks, potentially leading to resource exhaustion over time.
*   **bug4, bug8, bug9, bug11, bug12, bug13, bug14**: Program crashes and potential denial of service.
*   **bug10**: Application abort due to allocation failure

Attack vectors:
*   Loading and processing maliciously crafted SWF files.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
*   Ability to create SWF files.
*   Attacker needs to provide crafted SWF files.

Mitigation or fix:
*   The content provides links to PoC files.
