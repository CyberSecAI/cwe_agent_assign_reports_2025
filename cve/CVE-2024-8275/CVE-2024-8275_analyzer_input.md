# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-8275

## Vulnerability Description
The The Events Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the order parameter of the tribe_has_next_event function in all versions up to, and including, 6.6.4 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. Only sites that have manually added tribe_has_next_event() will be vulnerable to this **SQL injection**.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **impact:** extract sensitive information from the database
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **product:** The Events Calendar plugin for WordPress
- **version:** all versions up to and including 6.6.4
- **component:** tribe_has_next_event function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8275:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization and escaping of the `order` parameter within the `tribe_has_next_event` function in "The Events Calendar" plugin. This function doesn't properly prepare the SQL query using user-supplied data, leading to an SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (`order` parameter) before incorporating it into an SQL query. Specifically, the `order` parameter is not validated properly, allowing arbitrary SQL code to be injected into the query.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not adequately sanitize or escape the user-supplied `order` parameter before using it in database queries.
- **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The plugin does not utilize prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database by appending malicious SQL queries, leading to potential data exposure of user data, event details, or any other stored data.
- **Data Modification:** It might also be possible to modify or delete data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests by manipulating the `order` parameter used in the `tribe_has_next_event` function. This function is triggered when generating a page that uses the `tribe_has_next_event` template tag to display navigation between events.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated attackers, meaning that the attacker does not need to log into the WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Function:** The attacker needs knowledge that the site uses `tribe_has_next_event()` function, which is not enabled by default and only available if added manually.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `/src/Events/Custom_Tables/V1/WP_Query/Custom_Tables_Query.php` file.
- The `sanitize_order` function was added to address the vulnerability in version 6.6.4.1.
- The fix involves sanitizing the order direction by converting it to uppercase and comparing it to "DESC", defaulting to "ASC" if not "DESC".
