  "description": "The The Events Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the order parameter of the tribe_has_next_event function in all versions up to, and including, 6.6.4 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. Only sites that have manually added tribe_has_next_event() will be vulnerable to this **SQL injection**.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8275:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization and escaping of the `order` parameter within the `tribe_has_next_event` function in \"The Events Calendar\" plugin. This function doesn't properly prepare the SQL query using user-supplied data, leading to an SQL injection vulnerability.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **SQL Injection:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (`order` parameter) before incorporating it into an SQL query. Specifically, the `order` parameter is not validated properly, allowing arbitrary SQL code to be injected into the query.\n- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not adequately sanitize or escape the user-supplied `order` parameter before using it in database queries.\n- **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The plugin does not utilize prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database by appending malicious SQL queries, leading to potential data exposure of user data, event details, or any other stored data.\n- **Data Modification:** It might also be possible to modify or delete data.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests by manipulating the `order` parameter used in the `tribe_has_next_event` function. This function is triggered when generating a page that uses the `tribe_has_next_event` template tag to display navigation between events.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated attackers, meaning that the attacker does not need to log into the WordPress site.\n- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Function:** The attacker needs knowledge that the site uses `tribe_has_next_event()` function, which is not enabled by default and only available if added manually.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerable code is located in the `/src/Events/Custom_Tables/V1/WP_Query/Custom_Tables_Query.php` file.\n- The `sanitize_order` function was added to address the vulnerability in version 6.6.4.1.\n- The fix involves sanitizing the order direction by converting it to uppercase and comparing it to \"DESC\", defaulting to \"ASC\" if not \"DESC\".\n\nThis analysis provides more details than the initial CVE description which states \"PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval\".",

The root cause is **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query** leading to **SQL Injection** |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-89, which is a Base level CWE. No child CWEs of CWE-89 were considered because the description clearly indicates a general SQL Injection issue. The retriever results support this decision, as CWE-89 has the highest score. There are no parent or peer relationships that would suggest a different classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**, leading directly to the **SQL Injection** vulnerability (CWE-89), which allows attackers to **extract sensitive information from the database**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the clear evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The vulnerability is a classic SQL Injection issue due to **insufficient sanitization** of user-supplied input. The retriever results strongly support CWE-89 as the primary CWE.
