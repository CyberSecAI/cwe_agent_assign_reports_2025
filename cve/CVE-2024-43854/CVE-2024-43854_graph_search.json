For PI metadata this is limited to the app tag that isnt used by kernel generated metadata, but for non-PI metadata the entire buffer leaks kernel memory. Fix this by adding the __GFP_ZERO flag to allocations for writes. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-125 CWE-909 CWE-1285 CWE-190 CWE-362 CWE-197 CWE-367 CWE-908 CWE-126",
