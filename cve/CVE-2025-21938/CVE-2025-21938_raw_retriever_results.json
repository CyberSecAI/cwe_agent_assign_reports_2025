  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mptcp fix scheduling while atomic in mptcp_pm_nl_append_new_local_addr If multiple connection requests attempt to create an implicit mptcp endpoint in parallel, more than one caller may end up in mptcp_pm_nl_append_new_local_addr because none found the address in local_addr_list during their call to mptcp_pm_nl_get_local_id. In this case, the concurrent new_local_addr calls may delete the address entry created by the previous caller. These deletes use synchronize_rcu, but this is not permitted in some of the contexts where this function may be called. During packet recv, the caller may be in a rcu read critical section and have preemption disabled.

In the case where the external address is advertised and multiple connections already exist, multiple subflow SYNs arrive in parallel which tends to trigger the race during creation of the first local_addr_list entries which have the internal address instead. Fix by skipping the replacement of an existing implicit local address if called via mptcp_pm_nl_get_local_id.",
