  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is the function AssimpAC3DImporterConvertObjectSection of the file code/AssetLib/AC/ACLoader.cpp of the component AC3D File Handler. The manipulation of the argument src.entries leads to **out-of-bounds read**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

It details a bug report (Issue #6017) concerning an out-of-bounds read in the Assimp library, specifically within the `Assimp::AC3DImporter::ConvertObjectSection` function. Here's a breakdown of the information:\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of validation for `src.entries` leading to an out-of-bounds read of `object.vertices`.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Potential for remote code execution if an attacker can provide a malformed AC3D file that triggers the vulnerability.\n*   **Attack vectors:** Malformed AC3D file.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to create a specially crafted AC3D file and trick the victim into loading it with Assimp.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** Not specified in the provided content.\n*   **Affected versions:** assimp>=5.4.3\n\nThe content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including code snippets, GDB output, and a PoC using a fuzzer. It also includes instructions for building Assimp with sanitizers and running the fuzzer to reproduce the issue.",
