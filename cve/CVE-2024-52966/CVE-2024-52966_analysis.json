While CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE and generally discouraged, the lack of detailed information prevents selection of a more specific Base or Variant level CWE. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-200.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe200 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is simple:\n1.  **Root Cause:** Filter manipulation (inferred). The exact nature of the manipulation is not described.\n2.  **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information.\n\nThe chain is incomplete because the exact mechanism of filter manipulation isn't described.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the **information disclosure**. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor\" and \"cause **information disclosure** via filter manipulation\". Given the limited information and the high retriever score, CWE-200 was selected as the primary CWE, despite its discouraged usage.\n\nThe decision is heavily based on the vulnerability description's explicit language. Without further details about the **weakness** (filter manipulation), a more specific CWE cannot be chosen.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
