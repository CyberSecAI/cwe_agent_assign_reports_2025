As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287]. |\n| CWE-1295 | Debug Messages Revealing Unnecessary Information | 0.4 | Base | Secondary | Allowed: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** LOW\n\n## Relationship Analysis\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-200 which is a class level CWE. There are many potential child CWEs, but the evidence is lacking to choose a more specific CWE. CWE-1295 is a base CWE and a child of CWE-200.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe1295[\"CWE-1295: Debug Messages Revealing Unnecessary Information\"]\n    \n    cwe1295 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe1295 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe chain of weaknesses starts with an unspecified **weakness** that leads to **Information Disclosure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe vulnerability description indicates a Windows Cryptographic **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. The primary **weakness** is **Information Disclosure**.\n\nThe \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section lists CWE-NVD-noinfo as the primary CWE match, and CWE-668 and CWE-125 as the top CWEs. However, CWE-NVD-noinfo is not a valid CWE. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary is \"UNRELATED\" indicating a lack of supporting evidence.\n\nThe Retriever Results lists CWE-200 as the top combined result with a score of 0.800. While CWE-200 is discouraged because it is often misused to represent the impact rather than the root cause, it is the best option given the limited information.\n\nCWE-1295 is also listed as a possible CWE. Since the vulnerability involves cryptographic information disclosure, it's possible that debug messages are revealing sensitive information. However, without more information, it's difficult to say for sure.\n\nBased on the available information, the primary CWE is CWE-200, with CWE-1295 as a secondary candidate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.

As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287]. |\n| CWE-1295 | Debug Messages Revealing Unnecessary Information | 0.4 | Base | Secondary | Allowed: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** LOW\n\n## Relationship Analysis\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-200 which is a class level CWE. There are many potential child CWEs, but the evidence is lacking to choose a more specific CWE. CWE-1295 is a base CWE and a child of CWE-200.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe1295[\"CWE-1295: Debug Messages Revealing Unnecessary Information\"]\n    \n    cwe1295 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe1295 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe chain of weaknesses starts with an unspecified **weakness** that leads to **Information Disclosure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe vulnerability description indicates a Windows Cryptographic **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. The primary **weakness** is **Information Disclosure**.\n\nThe \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section lists CWE-NVD-noinfo as the primary CWE match, and CWE-668 and CWE-125 as the top CWEs. However, CWE-NVD-noinfo is not a valid CWE. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary is \"UNRELATED\" indicating a lack of supporting evidence.\n\nThe Retriever Results lists CWE-200 as the top combined result with a score of 0.800. While CWE-200 is discouraged because it is often misused to represent the impact rather than the root cause, it is the best option given the limited information.\n\nCWE-1295 is also listed as a possible CWE. Since the vulnerability involves cryptographic information disclosure, it's possible that debug messages are revealing sensitive information. However, without more information, it's difficult to say for sure.\n\nBased on the available information, the primary CWE is CWE-200, with CWE-1295 as a secondary candidate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
