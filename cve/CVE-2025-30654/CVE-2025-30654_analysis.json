  "description": "An Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in the User Interface (UI) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a local, low-privileged, authenticated attacker with access to the CLI to access sensitive information. Through the execution of a specific show mgd command, a user with limited permissions (e.g., a low-privileged login class user) can access sensitive information such as hashed passwords, that can be used to further impact the system. This issue affects Junos OS * All versions before 21.4R3-S10, * from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S5, * from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S5, * from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3, * from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S3. Junos OS Evolved * All versions before 21.4R3-S10-EVO, * from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S6-EVO, * from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S5-EVO, * from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S3-EVO, * from 23.4-EVO before 23.4R2-S3-EVO.",

While CWE-497 also aligns with the description, it is considered secondary since the root cause appears to stem from privilege misconfiguration, leading to the information exposure. Both are base level CWEs. There aren't any meaningful parent-child relationships directly influencing the decision, the main factor is the privilege assignment issue leading to the exposure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe266 primary\n    class cwe497 secondary\n    class cwe668 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Incorrect Privilege Assignment** (CWE-266). This leads to the ability of a low-privileged user to execute a specific command. This command then results in **Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere** (CWE-497). Thus the chain is: CWE-266 -> CWE-497\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the root cause is an **incorrect privilege assignment** (CWE-266) which allows a low-privileged user to execute a command that exposes sensitive information (CWE-497). The decision is based on the vulnerability description highlighting that \"a user with limited permissions (e.g., a low-privileged login class user) can access sensitive information\". This strongly suggests that the user was incorrectly assigned the privilege to execute the command despite their low-privilege status.\n\nThe \"Privileges vs Permissions Guidance\" section also points to using CWE-266 when the \"system assigns incorrect privileges to a user\".\n\nCWE-497 is considered a secondary weakness because the **exposure of sensitive information** is a consequence of the **incorrect privilege assignment**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity (Base level) as they directly represent the root cause and resulting weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1899.01\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-269 is commonly misused.
