Through the execution of a specific show mgd command, a user with limited permissions (e.g., a low-privileged login class user) can access sensitive information such as hashed passwords, that can be used to further impact the system. This issue affects Junos OS * All versions before 21.4R3-S10, * from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S5, * from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S5, * from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3, * from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S3.
