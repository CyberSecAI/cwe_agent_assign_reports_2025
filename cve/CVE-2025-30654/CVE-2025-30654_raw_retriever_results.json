  "query": "An Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in the User Interface (UI) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a local, low-privileged, authenticated attacker with access to the CLI to access sensitive information. Through the execution of a specific show mgd command, a user with limited permissions (e.g., a low-privileged login class user) can access sensitive information such as hashed passwords, that can be used to further impact the system. This issue affects Junos OS * All versions before 21.4R3-S10, * from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S5, * from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S5, * from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3, * from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S3. Junos OS Evolved * All versions before 21.4R3-S10-EVO, * from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S6-EVO, * from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S5-EVO, * from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S3-EVO, * from 23.4-EVO before 23.4R2-S3-EVO.",
