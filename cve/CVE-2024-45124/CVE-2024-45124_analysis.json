While less specific, it aligns with the description provided. CWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, and CWE-862, Missing Authorization, are child CWEs of CWE-284 and represent more specific authorization flaws. The relationships between these CWEs helped in considering the most appropriate level of abstraction. The choice of CWE-284 reflects the general nature of the vulnerability description, with possibility of the weakness falling under either CWE-863 or CWE-862.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Access Control** (CWE-284), leading to a Security Feature Bypass and low impact on Integrity.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the provided evidence, leads to the conclusion that CWE-284, Improper Access Control, is the most appropriate primary CWE.
