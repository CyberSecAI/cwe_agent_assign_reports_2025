The **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) CWE-352** is a compound weakness, and describes how the vulnerability can be exploited. There is no direct relationship between CWE-79 and CWE-352.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe352 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with a **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) CWE-352** vulnerability, which allows a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions. This leads to **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') CWE-79**, resulting in Stored XSS.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability that allows for Stored XSS. The **root cause** of the XSS vulnerability is the **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') CWE-79**. The **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) CWE-352** is how the attacker exploits the **XSS, cross-site scripting** weakness.\n\nThe retriever results support this assessment, with **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') CWE-79** having the highest score. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-79 is a base-level weakness, while CWE-352 is a compound weakness related to the attack vector.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
