  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-6447', description='The FULL - Cliente plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the license plan parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.12 due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** as well as **missing authorization** and capability checks on the related functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that will execute whenever an administrative user accesses wp-admin dashboard', key_phrases={'rootcause': ['insufficient input sanitization and output escaping', 'missing authorization'], 'weakness': 'cross-site scripting', 'impact': ['execute arbitrary web scripts', 'inject arbitrary web scripts'], 'vector': '', 'attacker': 'unauthenticated attackers', 'product': 'FULL - Cliente plugin for WordPress', 'version': 'up to and including 3.1.12', 'component': 'license plan parameter'}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6447\\n\\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the license plan parameter, coupled with missing authorization and capability checks. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript code can be stored in the database via a crafted license plan parameter.\\n*   **Missing Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing potentially harmful data to be stored.\\n*   **Missing Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly escape stored data before displaying it on a web page, allowing stored JavaScript to execute.\\n*   **Missing Authorization/Capability Checks:** The plugin lacks proper checks to restrict who can modify the license plan data, leading to an unauthenticated vulnerability.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\nAn unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts that will execute when an administrative user accesses the WordPress admin dashboard (wp-admin). This can lead to:\\n*   **Account Takeover:**  An attacker could potentially steal admin session cookies or credentials.\\n*   **Malicious Redirects:** The attacker could redirect admin users to malicious sites.\\n*   **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the appearance or functionality of the administrative interface.\\n*   **Malware Distribution:** The attacker could inject code that would download malware to the user's system.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n*   **Unauthenticated HTTP request:** Attackers send a crafted request to the `/license` REST route with malicious code in the 'plan' parameter within the JSON body. This route has a `permission_callback` of `__return_true`, meaning no authentication is required.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n*   **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need a valid account or user credentials.\\n*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.\\n\\n**Technical Details:**\\n\\n*   The vulnerability is located in the `FULL \u2013 Cliente` plugin, versions up to and including 3.1.12.\\n*   The vulnerable code is within `app/api/Connection.php` (specifically in the `license` function) and how it processes the license data in `app/controller/inc/License.php`.\\n*   The `license` function in `Connection.php` retrieves data using `$request->get_json_params()` which doesn't sanitize the input, then the `updateReceivedLicense` function in `License.php` saves the unsanitized data. This data is later used to display the plugin's settings page in the admin dashboard in `app/controller/actions.php`.\\n*   The `permission_callback` of the `/license` route in `Connection.php` is set to `__return_true`, which allows unauthenticated access.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n* The Wordfence article indicates the vulnerability has been patched in version 3.1.13.\\n* The code snippets from the Trac system show the relevant files within the plugin's directory structure.\\n\\nThis information provides more detail than the standard CVE description.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
