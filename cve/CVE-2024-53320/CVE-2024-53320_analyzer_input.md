### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack buffer overflows**
- **product:** Qualisys C++ SDK
- **component:** GetCurrentFrame, SaveCapture, and LoadProject functions

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
CVE-2024-53320 is not specified, so I cannot verify if the content relates to it. However, I can analyze the provided content for vulnerabilities.

**VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS**

The content details multiple stack buffer overflows in the Qualysys C++ SDK.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the use of undersized fixed-size stack buffers (100-256 bytes) combined with unsafe string operations like `strcat` and `sprintf`. These functions do not perform bounds checking, allowing an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer size.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability.
*   **Unsafe String Operations:** Use of `strcat` and `sprintf` without proper bounds checking.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Stack corruption
*   Code execution
*   Information disclosure
*   Denial of Service (Crash)

**Attack vectors:**

An attacker can control component options passed to real-time data retrieval functions (e.g., `GetCurrentFrame`) to craft options that generate large component strings, triggering the buffer overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

The attacker needs to be able to control the component options passed to the affected functions. This likely requires the ability to influence the input data or configuration used by the SDK.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The recommendation is to replace fixed-size buffers with dynamic allocation using `std::string` or `std::vector<char>` along with `strncpy` to prevent overflows.

**Affected Functions:**

*   `GetCurrentFrame` (256 byte buffer)
*   `SaveCapture` (100 byte buffer)
*   `LoadProject` (100 byte buffer)

The provided content includes detailed stack traces from AddressSanitizer (ASAN) reports, pinpointing the exact locations of the overflows within the code. This level of detail goes beyond a typical CVE description.
