CWE-214 [Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information] is related as the command-line flag exposes the sensitive data.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe214[\"CWE-214: Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe214 -->|CAN_FOLLOW| cwe312\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe214 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the application storing sensitive information. The use of the `--show-inputs-only` flag then leads to **cleartext storage** of the information on the terminal.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-312 [Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information] because the core issue is the display of securely stored properties in **cleartext**. The command-line flag is a contributing factor, leading to the exposure, making CWE-214 [Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information] a secondary concern. The evidence directly supports CWE-312 as the **impact** of the vulnerability is the **display of sensitive information in cleartext**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25

In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders. If a system administrator can recover a password directly, or use a brute force search on the available information, the administrator can use the password on other accounts.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 376.59\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nStoring a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n-",
