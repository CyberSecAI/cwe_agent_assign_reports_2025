## Vulnerability Description
An issue in Silverpeas v.6.4.2 and lower allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service via the password change function.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** denial of service
- **vector:** password change function
- **attacker:** remote attacker
- **product:** Silverpeas
- **version:** 6.4.2 and lower

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-42849:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the password change functionality of Silverpeas versions 6.4.2 and lower.
*   The system attempts to hash user-supplied passwords. When an excessively long string (e.g., 1MB) is provided as a password, the hashing process consumes excessive resources, leading to a denial-of-service.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Resource exhaustion:** The application lacks proper input validation or resource management when processing excessively long password strings. This allows an attacker to overwhelm the system by causing it to allocate significant processing power or memory attempting to hash an extremely large password.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition, where the Silverpeas application becomes unresponsive due to high resource consumption. This prevents legitimate users from accessing the platform's services.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote attack:** The attack can be launched remotely.
*   **Password Change Function:** The attack exploits the password change function within the Silverpeas application.
*   **Malicious Payload:** The attacker needs to craft a specific payload that contains a very large string, to be used as the new password.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker requires network access to the Silverpeas application.
*   **Ability to intercept and modify requests:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify the password change request (e.g., through a proxy like Burp Suite), in order to inject the malicious payload.
*  **No need for authentication:** Based on the description, it seems the attacker may not need authentication, given that the password change request is initiated before logging in.
