# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-50088
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved btrfs fix uninitialized pointer free in add_inode_ref() The add_inode_ref() function does not initialize the name struct when it is declared. If any of the following calls to read_one_inode() returns NULL, dir = read_one_inode(root, parent_objectid) if (!dir) { ret = -ENOENT goto out } inode = read_one_inode(root, inode_objectid) if (!inode) { ret = -EIO goto out } then name.name would be freed on out before being initialized. out ... kfree(name.name) This issue was reported by Coverity with CID 1526744.

## Keyphrases
