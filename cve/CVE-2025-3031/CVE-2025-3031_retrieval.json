It translates a target-independent intermediate representation into executable machine code. There is a bug in 0.73 of the Cranelift x64 backend that can create a scenario that could result in a potential sandbox escape in a Wasm program. This bug was introduced in the new backend on 2020-09-08 and first included in a release on 2020-09-30, but the new backend was not the default prior to 0.73. The recently-released version 0.73 with default settings, and prior versions with an explicit build flag to select the new backend, are vulnerable. The bug in question performs a sign-extend instead of a zero-extend on a value loaded from the stack, under a specific set of circumstances. If those circumstances occur, the bug could allow access to memory addresses upto 2GiB before the start of the Wasm program heap. If the heap bound is larger than 2GiB, then it would be possible to read memory from a computable range dependent on the size of the heaps bound. The impact of this bug is highly dependent on heap implementation, specifically: * if the heap has bounds checks, and * does not rely exclusively on guard pages, and * the heap bound is 2GiB or smaller * then this bug cannot be used to reach memory from another Wasm program heap. The impact of the vulnerability is mitigated if there is no memory mapped in the range accessible using this bug, for example, if there is a 2 GiB guard region before the Wasm program heap. The bug in question performs a sign-extend instead of a zero-extend on a value loaded from the stack, when the register allocator reloads a spilled integer value narrower than 64 bits. This interacts poorly with another optimization: the instruction selector elides a 32-to-64-bit zero-extend operator when we know that an instruction producing a 32-bit value actually zeros the upper 32 bits of its destination register. Hence, we rely on these zeroed bits, but the type of the value is still i32, and the spill/reload reconstitutes those bits as the sign extension of the i32\u2019s MSB. The issue would thus occur when: * An i32 value in a Wasm program is greater than or equal to 0x8000_0000; * The value is spilled and reloaded by the register allocator due to high register pressure in the program between the value\u2019s definition and its use; * The value is produced by an instruction that we know to be \u201cspecial\u201d in that it zeroes the upper 32 bits of its destination: add, sub, mul, and, or; * The value is then zero-extended to 64 bits in the Wasm program; * The resulting 64-bit value is used. Under these circumstances there is a potential sandbox escape when the i32 value is a pointer. The usual code emitted for heap accesses zero-extends the Wasm heap address, adds it to a 64-bit heap base, and accesses the resulting address. If the zero-extend becomes a sign-extend, the program could reach backward and access memory up to 2GiB before the start of its heap. In addition to assessing the nature of the code generation bug in Cranelift, we have also determined that under specific circumstances, both Lucet and Wasmtime using this version of Cranelift may be exploitable.

The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNorm` is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. If the tensors are empty, the same implementation can trigger undefined behavior by dereferencing null pointers. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/57d86e0db5d1365f19adcce848dfc1bf89fdd4c7/tensorflow/core/kernels/fused_batch_norm_op.cc) fails to validate that `scale`, `offset`, `mean` and `variance` (the last two only when required) all have the same number of elements as the number of channels of `x`. This results in heap out of bounds reads when the buffers backing these tensors are indexed past their boundary. If the tensors are empty, the validation mentioned in the above paragraph would also trigger and prevent the undefined behavior. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29988: Firefox incorrectly treated an inline list-item element as a block element, resulting in an out of bounds read or memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

The function ezxml_parse_str() performs incorrect memory handling while parsing crafted XML files (out-of-bounds read after a certain strcspn failure).\n\n- CVE-2021-32761: Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. A vulnerability involving out-of-bounds read and integer overflow to buffer overflow exists starting with version 2.2 and prior to versions 5.0.13, 6.0.15, and 6.2.5. On 32-bit systems, Redis `*BIT*` command are vulnerable to integer overflow that can potentially be exploited to corrupt the heap, leak arbitrary heap contents or trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter to a very large value and constructing specially crafted commands bit commands. This problem only affects Redis on 32-bit platforms, or compiled as a 32-bit binary. Redis versions 5.0.`3m 6.0.15, and 6.2.5 contain patches for this issue. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the `redis-server` executable is to prevent users from modifying the `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.\n\n- CVE-2021-3409: The patch for CVE-2020-17380/CVE-2020-25085 was found to be ineffective, thus making QEMU vulnerable to the out-of-bounds read/write access issues previously found in the SDHCI controller emulation code. This flaw allows a malicious privileged guest to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service or potential code execution. QEMU up to (including) 5.2.0 is affected by this.\n\n- CVE-2021-3517: There is a flaw in the xml entity encoding functionality of libxml2 in versions before 2.9.11. An attacker who is able to supply a crafted file to be processed by an application linked with the affected functionality of libxml2 could trigger an out-of-bounds read. The most likely impact of this flaw is to application availability, with some potential impact to confidentiality and integrity if an attacker is able to use memory information to further exploit the application.\n\n- CVE-2021-3712: ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext).

Prior to version 2.0.2, there is a bug in Wasmtime's implementation of its pooling instance allocator when the allocator is configured to give WebAssembly instances a maximum of zero pages of memory. In this configuration, the virtual memory mapping for WebAssembly memories did not meet the compiler-required configuration requirements for safely executing WebAssembly modules. Wasmtime's default settings require virtual memory page faults to indicate that wasm reads/writes are out-of-bounds, but the pooling allocator's configuration would not create an appropriate virtual memory mapping for this meaning out of bounds reads/writes can successfully read/write memory unrelated to the wasm sandbox within range of the base address of the memory mapping created by the pooling allocator. This bug is not applicable with the default settings of the `wasmtime` crate. This bug can only be triggered by setting `InstanceLimits::memory_pages` to zero. This is expected to be a very rare configuration since this means that wasm modules cannot allocate any pages of linear memory. All wasm modules produced by all current toolchains are highly likely to use linear memory, so it's expected to be unlikely that this configuration is set to zero by any production embedding of Wasmtime. This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2. This bug can be worked around by increasing the `memory_pages` allotment when configuring the pooling allocator to a value greater than zero. If an embedding wishes to still prevent memory from actually being used then the `Store::limiter` method can be used to dynamically disallow growth of memory beyond 0 bytes large. Note that the default `memory_pages` value is greater than zero.\n\n- CVE-2022-41902: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The function MakeGrapplerFunctionItem takes arguments that determine the sizes of inputs and outputs. If the inputs given are greater than or equal to the sizes of the outputs, an out-of-bounds memory read or a crash is triggered. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit a65411a1d69edfb16b25907ffb8f73556ce36bb7. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.8.4, 2.9.3, and 2.10.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-41981: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the TGA file format parser of OpenImageIO v2.3.19.0. A specially-crafted targa file can lead to out of bounds read and write on the process stack, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-4203: A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. In theory it could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext) although we are not aware of any working exploit leading to memory contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects. \n\n- CVE-2022-48303: GNU Tar through 1.34 has a one-byte out-of-bounds read that results in use of uninitialized memory for a conditional jump.

The implementation of `tf.io.decode_raw` produces incorrect results and crashes the Python interpreter when combining `fixed_length` and wider datatypes. The implementation of the padded version(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc) is buggy due to a confusion about pointer arithmetic rules. First, the code computes(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L61) the width of each output element by dividing the `fixed_length` value to the size of the type argument. The `fixed_length` argument is also used to determine the size needed for the output tensor(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L63-L79). This is followed by reencoding code(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L85-L94). The erroneous code is the last line above: it is moving the `out_data` pointer by `fixed_length * sizeof(T)` bytes whereas it only copied at most `fixed_length` bytes from the input. This results in parts of the input not being decoded into the output. Furthermore, because the pointer advance is far wider than desired, this quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data. This OOB write leads to interpreter crash in the reproducer mentioned here, but more severe attacks can be mounted too, given that this gadget allows writing to periodically placed locations in memory. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29947: Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 87.

They generally contain junk data with the contents of stack memory before the function was invoked. An attacker can sometimes control or read these contents. In other languages or conditions, a variable that is not explicitly initialized can be given a default value that has security implications, depending on the logic of the program. The presence of an uninitialized variable can sometimes indicate a typographic error in the code.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2019-15900: Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n\n- CVE-2008-3688: Chain: A denial of service may be caused by an uninitialized variable (CWE-457) allowing an infinite loop (CWE-835) resulting from a connection to an unresponsive server.\n\n- CVE-2008-0081: Uninitialized variable leads to code execution in popular desktop application.\n\n- CVE-2007-4682: Crafted input triggers dereference of an uninitialized object pointer.\n\n- CVE-2007-3468: Crafted audio file triggers crash when an uninitialized variable is used.\n\n- CVE-2007-2728: Uninitialized random seed variable used.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1619: A vulnerability in the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) function of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass NETCONF or RESTCONF authentication and do either of the following: Install, manipulate, or delete the configuration of an affected device Cause memory corruption that results in a denial of service (DoS) on an affected device This vulnerability is due to an uninitialized variable. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of NETCONF or RESTCONF requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use NETCONF or RESTCONF to install, manipulate, or delete the configuration of a network device or to corrupt memory on the device, resulting a DoS.\n\n- CVE-2021-41253: Zydis is an x86/x86-64 disassembler library. Users of Zydis versions v3.2.0 and older that use the string functions provided in `zycore` in order to append untrusted user data to the formatter buffer within their custom formatter hooks can run into heap buffer overflows. Older versions of Zydis failed to properly initialize the string object within the formatter buffer, forgetting to initialize a few fields, leaving their value to chance. This could then in turn cause zycore functions like `ZyanStringAppend` to make incorrect calculations for the new target size, resulting in heap memory corruption. This does not affect the regular uncustomized Zydis formatter, because Zydis internally doesn't use the string functions in zycore that act upon these fields. However, because the zycore string functions are the intended way to work with the formatter buffer for users of the library that wish to extend the formatter, we still consider this to be a vulnerability in Zydis. This bug is patched starting in version 3.2.1. As a workaround, users may refrain from using zycore string functions in their formatter hooks until updating to a patched version.\n\n- CVE-2021-21140: Uninitialized use in USB in Google Chrome prior to 88.0.4324.96 allowed a local attacker to potentially perform out of bounds memory access via via a USB device.\n\n- CVE-2021-44003: A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V13.2.0.5), Teamcenter Visualization (All versions < V13.2.0.5).

Versions prior to 4.9 are vulnerable to an Out-of-bounds read. While processing the L2CAP protocol, the Bluetooth Low Energy stack of Contiki-NG needs to map an incoming channel ID to its metadata structure. While looking up the corresponding channel structure in get_channel_for_cid (in os/net/mac/ble/ble-l2cap.c), a bounds check is performed on the incoming channel ID, which is meant to ensure that the channel ID does not exceed the maximum number of supported channels.However, an integer truncation issue leads to only the lowest byte of the channel ID to be checked, which leads to an incomplete out-of-bounds check. A crafted channel ID leads to out-of-bounds memory to be read and written with attacker-controlled data. The vulnerability has been patched in the \"develop\" branch of Contiki-NG, and will be included in release 4.9. As a workaround, Users can apply the patch in Contiki-NG pull request 2081 on GitHub.\n\n- CVE-2022-42324: Oxenstored 32->31 bit integer truncation issues Integers in Ocaml are 63 or 31 bits of signed precision. The Ocaml Xenbus library takes a C uint32_t out of the ring and casts it directly to an Ocaml integer. In 64-bit Ocaml builds this is fine, but in 32-bit builds, it truncates off the most significant bit, and then creates unsigned/signed confusion in the remainder. This in turn can feed a negative value into logic not expecting a negative value, resulting in unexpected exceptions being thrown. The unexpected exception is not handled suitably, creating a busy-loop trying (and failing) to take the bad packet out of the xenstore ring.\n\n- CVE-2022-34169: The Apache Xalan Java XSLT library is vulnerable to an integer truncation issue when processing malicious XSLT stylesheets.

In code prior to the `8c0eca3` commit h2o may attempt to access uninitialized memory. When receiving QUIC frames in certain order, HTTP/3 server-side implementation of h2o can be misguided to treat uninitialized memory as HTTP/3 frames that have been received. When h2o is used as a reverse proxy, an attacker can abuse this vulnerability to send internal state of h2o to backend servers controlled by the attacker or third party. Also, if there is an HTTP endpoint that reflects the traffic sent from the client, an attacker can use that reflector to obtain internal state of h2o. This internal state includes traffic of other connections in unencrypted form and TLS session tickets. This vulnerability exists in h2o server with HTTP/3 support, between commit 93af138 and d1f0f65.

In versions prior to 0.14.0 Elvish's web UI backend (started by `elvish -web`) hosts an endpoint that allows executing the code sent from the web UI. The backend does not check the origin of requests correctly. As a result, if the user has the web UI backend open and visits a compromised or malicious website, the website can send arbitrary code to the endpoint in localhost. All Elvish releases from 0.14.0 onward no longer include the the web UI, although it is still possible for the user to build a version from source that includes the web UI. The issue can be patched for previous versions by removing the web UI (found in web, pkg/web or pkg/prog/web, depending on the exact version).\n\n- CVE-2021-1231: A vulnerability in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) for Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to disable switching on a small form-factor pluggable (SFP) interface. This vulnerability is due to incomplete validation of the source of a received LLDP packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LLDP packet on an SFP interface to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to disable switching on the SFP interface, which could disrupt network traffic.\n\n- CVE-2021-41158: FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. Prior to version 1.10.7, an attacker can perform a SIP digest leak attack against FreeSWITCH and receive the challenge response of a gateway configured on the FreeSWITCH server. This is done by challenging FreeSWITCH's SIP requests with the realm set to that of the gateway, thus forcing FreeSWITCH to respond with the challenge response which is based on the password of that targeted gateway. Abuse of this vulnerability allows attackers to potentially recover gateway passwords by performing a fast offline password cracking attack on the challenge response. The attacker does not require special network privileges, such as the ability to sniff the FreeSWITCH's network traffic, to exploit this issue. Instead, what is required for this attack to work is the ability to cause the victim server to send SIP request messages to the malicious party. Additionally, to exploit this issue, the attacker needs to specify the correct realm which might in some cases be considered secret. However, because many gateways are actually public, this information can easily be retrieved. The vulnerability appears to be due to the code which handles challenges in `sofia_reg.c`, `sofia_reg_handle_sip_r_challenge()` which does not check if the challenge is originating from the actual gateway. The lack of these checks allows arbitrary UACs (and gateways) to challenge any request sent by FreeSWITCH with the realm of the gateway being targeted. This issue is patched in version 10.10.7. Maintainers recommend that one should create an association between a SIP session for each gateway and its realm to make a check be put into place for this association when responding to challenges.\n\n- CVE-2021-4024: A flaw was found in podman. The `podman machine` function (used to create and manage Podman virtual machine containing a Podman process) spawns a `gvproxy` process on the host system. The `gvproxy` API is accessible on port 7777 on all IP addresses on the host. If that port is open on the host's firewall, an attacker can potentially use the `gvproxy` API to forward ports on the host to ports in the VM, making private services on the VM accessible to the network. This issue could be also used to interrupt the host's services by forwarding all ports to the VM.\n\n- CVE-2021-45441: A origin validation error vulnerability in Trend Micro Apex One (on-prem and SaaS) could allow a local attacker drop and manipulate a specially crafted file to issue commands over a certain pipe and elevate to a higher level of privileges. Please note: an attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-25146: The Remote App module in Liferay Portal Liferay Portal v7.4.3.4 through v7.4.3.8 and Liferay DXP 7.4 before update 5 does not check if the origin of event messages it receives matches the origin of the Remote App, allowing attackers to exfiltrate the CSRF token via a crafted event message.\n\n- CVE-2022-41924: A vulnerability identified in the Tailscale Windows client allows a malicious website to reconfigure the Tailscale daemon `tailscaled`, which can then be used to remotely execute code. In the Tailscale Windows client, the local API was bound to a local TCP socket, and communicated with the Windows client GUI in cleartext with no Host header verification. This allowed an attacker-controlled website visited by the node to rebind DNS to an attacker-controlled DNS server, and then make local API requests in the client, including changing the coordination server to an attacker-controlled coordination server. An attacker-controlled coordination server can send malicious URL responses to the client, including pushing executables or installing an SMB share. These allow the attacker to remotely execute code on the node. All Windows clients prior to version v.1.32.3 are affected. If you are running Tailscale on Windows, upgrade to v1.32.3 or later to remediate the issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-38507: The Opportunistic Encryption feature of HTTP2 (RFC 8164) allows a connection to be transparently upgraded to TLS while retaining the visual properties of an HTTP connection, including being same-origin with unencrypted connections on port 80. However, if a second encrypted port on the same IP address (e.g. port 8443) did not opt-in to opportunistic encryption; a network attacker could forward a connection from the browser to port 443 to port 8443, causing the browser to treat the content of port 8443 as same-origin with HTTP. This was resolved by disabling the Opportunistic Encryption feature, which had low usage. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.\n\n- CVE-2022-24762: sysend.js is a library that allows a user to send messages between pages that are open in the same browser. Users that use cross-origin communication may have their communications intercepted. Impact is limited by the communication occurring in the same browser. This issue has been patched in sysend.js version 1.10.0. The only currently known workaround is to avoid sending communications that a user does not want to have intercepted via sysend messages.\n\n- CVE-2021-33959: Plex media server 1.21 and before is vulnerable to ddos reflection attack via plex service.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-345 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-345 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",

Many internal data structures also require this initialize / dispose discipline, but not all of them. When the \"soft reset\" feature was implemented, the libxl__domain_suspend_state structure didn't require any initialization or disposal. At some point later, an initialization function was introduced for the structure; but the \"soft reset\" path wasn't refactored to call the initialization function. When a guest nwo initiates a \"soft reboot\", uninitialized data structure leads to an assert() when later code finds the structure in an unexpected state. The effect of this is to crash the process monitoring the guest. How this affects the system depends on the structure of the toolstack. For xl, this will have no security-relevant effect: every VM has its own independent monitoring process, which contains no state. The domain in question will hang in a crashed state, but can be destroyed by `xl destroy` just like any other non-cooperating domain. For daemon-based toolstacks linked against libxl, such as libvirt, this will crash the toolstack, losing the state of any in-progress operations (localized DoS), and preventing further administrator operations unless the daemon is configured to restart automatically (system-wide DoS). If crashes \"leak\" resources, then repeated crashes could use up resources, also causing a system-wide DoS.\n\n- CVE-2021-23386: This affects the package dns-packet before 5.2.2.

This flaw affects the Linux kernel versions prior to 5.17-rc1.\n\n- CVE-2021-0946: The method PVRSRVBridgePMRPDumpSymbolicAddr allocates puiMemspaceNameInt on the heap, fills the contents of the buffer via PMR_PDumpSymbolicAddr, and then copies the buffer to userspace. The method PMR_PDumpSymbolicAddr may fail, and if it does the buffer will be left uninitialized and despite the error will still be copied to userspace. Kernel leak of uninitialized heap data with no privs required.Product: AndroidVersions: Android SoCAndroid ID: A-236846966\n\n- CVE-2021-0947: The method PVRSRVBridgeTLDiscoverStreams allocates puiStreamsInt on the heap, fills the contents of the buffer via TLServerDiscoverStreamsKM, and then copies the buffer to userspace. The method TLServerDiscoverStreamsKM may fail for several reasons including invalid sizes. If this method fails the buffer will be left uninitialized and despite the error will still be copied to userspace. Kernel leak of uninitialized heap data with no privs required.Product: AndroidVersions: Android SoCAndroid ID: A-236838960\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-665 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-665 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-908 (CanPrecede)",

It translates a target-independent intermediate representation into executable machine code. There is a bug in 0.73 of the Cranelift x64 backend that can create a scenario that could result in a potential sandbox escape in a Wasm program. This bug was introduced in the new backend on 2020-09-08 and first included in a release on 2020-09-30, but the new backend was not the default prior to 0.73. The recently-released version 0.73 with default settings, and prior versions with an explicit build flag to select the new backend, are vulnerable. The bug in question performs a sign-extend instead of a zero-extend on a value loaded from the stack, under a specific set of circumstances. If those circumstances occur, the bug could allow access to memory addresses upto 2GiB before the start of the Wasm program heap. If the heap bound is larger than 2GiB, then it would be possible to read memory from a computable range dependent on the size of the heaps bound. The impact of this bug is highly dependent on heap implementation, specifically: * if the heap has bounds checks, and * does not rely exclusively on guard pages, and * the heap bound is 2GiB or smaller * then this bug cannot be used to reach memory from another Wasm program heap. The impact of the vulnerability is mitigated if there is no memory mapped in the range accessible using this bug, for example, if there is a 2 GiB guard region before the Wasm program heap. The bug in question performs a sign-extend instead of a zero-extend on a value loaded from the stack, when the register allocator reloads a spilled integer value narrower than 64 bits. This interacts poorly with another optimization: the instruction selector elides a 32-to-64-bit zero-extend operator when we know that an instruction producing a 32-bit value actually zeros the upper 32 bits of its destination register. Hence, we rely on these zeroed bits, but the type of the value is still i32, and the spill/reload reconstitutes those bits as the sign extension of the i32\u2019s MSB. The issue would thus occur when: * An i32 value in a Wasm program is greater than or equal to 0x8000_0000; * The value is spilled and reloaded by the register allocator due to high register pressure in the program between the value\u2019s definition and its use; * The value is produced by an instruction that we know to be \u201cspecial\u201d in that it zeroes the upper 32 bits of its destination: add, sub, mul, and, or; * The value is then zero-extended to 64 bits in the Wasm program; * The resulting 64-bit value is used. Under these circumstances there is a potential sandbox escape when the i32 value is a pointer. The usual code emitted for heap accesses zero-extends the Wasm heap address, adds it to a 64-bit heap base, and accesses the resulting address. If the zero-extend becomes a sign-extend, the program could reach backward and access memory up to 2GiB before the start of its heap. In addition to assessing the nature of the code generation bug in Cranelift, we have also determined that under specific circumstances, both Lucet and Wasmtime using this version of Cranelift may be exploitable.

The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNorm` is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. If the tensors are empty, the same implementation can trigger undefined behavior by dereferencing null pointers. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/57d86e0db5d1365f19adcce848dfc1bf89fdd4c7/tensorflow/core/kernels/fused_batch_norm_op.cc) fails to validate that `scale`, `offset`, `mean` and `variance` (the last two only when required) all have the same number of elements as the number of channels of `x`. This results in heap out of bounds reads when the buffers backing these tensors are indexed past their boundary. If the tensors are empty, the validation mentioned in the above paragraph would also trigger and prevent the undefined behavior. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29988: Firefox incorrectly treated an inline list-item element as a block element, resulting in an out of bounds read or memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

The function ezxml_parse_str() performs incorrect memory handling while parsing crafted XML files (out-of-bounds read after a certain strcspn failure).\n\n- CVE-2021-32761: Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. A vulnerability involving out-of-bounds read and integer overflow to buffer overflow exists starting with version 2.2 and prior to versions 5.0.13, 6.0.15, and 6.2.5. On 32-bit systems, Redis `*BIT*` command are vulnerable to integer overflow that can potentially be exploited to corrupt the heap, leak arbitrary heap contents or trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter to a very large value and constructing specially crafted commands bit commands. This problem only affects Redis on 32-bit platforms, or compiled as a 32-bit binary. Redis versions 5.0.`3m 6.0.15, and 6.2.5 contain patches for this issue. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the `redis-server` executable is to prevent users from modifying the `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.\n\n- CVE-2021-3409: The patch for CVE-2020-17380/CVE-2020-25085 was found to be ineffective, thus making QEMU vulnerable to the out-of-bounds read/write access issues previously found in the SDHCI controller emulation code. This flaw allows a malicious privileged guest to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service or potential code execution. QEMU up to (including) 5.2.0 is affected by this.\n\n- CVE-2021-3517: There is a flaw in the xml entity encoding functionality of libxml2 in versions before 2.9.11. An attacker who is able to supply a crafted file to be processed by an application linked with the affected functionality of libxml2 could trigger an out-of-bounds read. The most likely impact of this flaw is to application availability, with some potential impact to confidentiality and integrity if an attacker is able to use memory information to further exploit the application.\n\n- CVE-2021-3712: ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2y).\n\n- CVE-2021-31174: Microsoft Excel Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-27408: The affected product is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read, which can cause information leakage leading to arbitrary code execution if chained to the out-of-bounds write vulnerability on the Welch Allyn medical device management tools (Welch Allyn Service Tool: versions prior to v1.10, Welch Allyn Connex Device Integration Suite \u2013 Network Connectivity Engine (NCE): versions prior to v5.3, Welch Allyn Software Development Kit (SDK): versions prior to v3.2, Welch Allyn Connex Central Station (CS): versions prior to v1.8.6, Welch Allyn Service Monitor: versions prior to v1.7.0.0, Welch Allyn Connex Vital Signs Monitor (CVSM): versions prior to v2.43.02, Welch Allyn Connex Integrated Wall System (CIWS): versions prior to v2.43.02, Welch Allyn Connex Spot Monitor (CSM): versions prior to v1.52, Welch Allyn Spot Vital Signs 4400 Device (Spot 4400) / Welch Allyn Spot 4400 Vital Signs Extended Care Device: versions prior to v1.11.00).\n\n- CVE-2021-27791: The function that is used to parse the Authentication header in Brocade Fabric OS Web application service before Brocade Fabric OS v9.0.1a and v8.2.3a fails to properly process a malformed authentication header from the client, resulting in reading memory addresses outside the intended range.

User interaction is not required.\n\n- CVE-2022-35260: curl can be told to parse a `.netrc` file for credentials. If that file endsin a line with 4095 consecutive non-white space letters and no newline, curlwould first read past the end of the stack-based buffer, and if the readworks, write a zero byte beyond its boundary.This will in most cases cause a segfault or similar, but circumstances might also cause different outcomes.If a malicious user can provide a custom netrc file to an application or otherwise affect its contents, this flaw could be used as denial-of-service.\n\n- CVE-2022-39392: Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to version 2.0.2, there is a bug in Wasmtime's implementation of its pooling instance allocator when the allocator is configured to give WebAssembly instances a maximum of zero pages of memory. In this configuration, the virtual memory mapping for WebAssembly memories did not meet the compiler-required configuration requirements for safely executing WebAssembly modules. Wasmtime's default settings require virtual memory page faults to indicate that wasm reads/writes are out-of-bounds, but the pooling allocator's configuration would not create an appropriate virtual memory mapping for this meaning out of bounds reads/writes can successfully read/write memory unrelated to the wasm sandbox within range of the base address of the memory mapping created by the pooling allocator. This bug is not applicable with the default settings of the `wasmtime` crate. This bug can only be triggered by setting `InstanceLimits::memory_pages` to zero. This is expected to be a very rare configuration since this means that wasm modules cannot allocate any pages of linear memory. All wasm modules produced by all current toolchains are highly likely to use linear memory, so it's expected to be unlikely that this configuration is set to zero by any production embedding of Wasmtime. This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2. This bug can be worked around by increasing the `memory_pages` allotment when configuring the pooling allocator to a value greater than zero. If an embedding wishes to still prevent memory from actually being used then the `Store::limiter` method can be used to dynamically disallow growth of memory beyond 0 bytes large. Note that the default `memory_pages` value is greater than zero.\n\n- CVE-2022-41902: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The function MakeGrapplerFunctionItem takes arguments that determine the sizes of inputs and outputs. If the inputs given are greater than or equal to the sizes of the outputs, an out-of-bounds memory read or a crash is triggered. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit a65411a1d69edfb16b25907ffb8f73556ce36bb7. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.8.4, 2.9.3, and 2.10.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-41981: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the TGA file format parser of OpenImageIO v2.3.19.0. A specially-crafted targa file can lead to out of bounds read and write on the process stack, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-4203: A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. In theory it could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext) although we are not aware of any working exploit leading to memory contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects. \n\n- CVE-2022-48303: GNU Tar through 1.34 has a one-byte out-of-bounds read that results in use of uninitialized memory for a conditional jump.

The implementation of `tf.io.decode_raw` produces incorrect results and crashes the Python interpreter when combining `fixed_length` and wider datatypes. The implementation of the padded version(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc) is buggy due to a confusion about pointer arithmetic rules. First, the code computes(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L61) the width of each output element by dividing the `fixed_length` value to the size of the type argument. The `fixed_length` argument is also used to determine the size needed for the output tensor(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L63-L79). This is followed by reencoding code(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L85-L94). The erroneous code is the last line above: it is moving the `out_data` pointer by `fixed_length * sizeof(T)` bytes whereas it only copied at most `fixed_length` bytes from the input. This results in parts of the input not being decoded into the output. Furthermore, because the pointer advance is far wider than desired, this quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data. This OOB write leads to interpreter crash in the reproducer mentioned here, but more severe attacks can be mounted too, given that this gadget allows writing to periodically placed locations in memory. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29947: Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 87.

They generally contain junk data with the contents of stack memory before the function was invoked. An attacker can sometimes control or read these contents. In other languages or conditions, a variable that is not explicitly initialized can be given a default value that has security implications, depending on the logic of the program. The presence of an uninitialized variable can sometimes indicate a typographic error in the code.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2019-15900: Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n\n- CVE-2008-3688: Chain: A denial of service may be caused by an uninitialized variable (CWE-457) allowing an infinite loop (CWE-835) resulting from a connection to an unresponsive server.\n\n- CVE-2008-0081: Uninitialized variable leads to code execution in popular desktop application.\n\n- CVE-2007-4682: Crafted input triggers dereference of an uninitialized object pointer.\n\n- CVE-2007-3468: Crafted audio file triggers crash when an uninitialized variable is used.\n\n- CVE-2007-2728: Uninitialized random seed variable used.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1619: A vulnerability in the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) function of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass NETCONF or RESTCONF authentication and do either of the following: Install, manipulate, or delete the configuration of an affected device Cause memory corruption that results in a denial of service (DoS) on an affected device This vulnerability is due to an uninitialized variable. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of NETCONF or RESTCONF requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use NETCONF or RESTCONF to install, manipulate, or delete the configuration of a network device or to corrupt memory on the device, resulting a DoS.\n\n- CVE-2021-41253: Zydis is an x86/x86-64 disassembler library. Users of Zydis versions v3.2.0 and older that use the string functions provided in `zycore` in order to append untrusted user data to the formatter buffer within their custom formatter hooks can run into heap buffer overflows. Older versions of Zydis failed to properly initialize the string object within the formatter buffer, forgetting to initialize a few fields, leaving their value to chance. This could then in turn cause zycore functions like `ZyanStringAppend` to make incorrect calculations for the new target size, resulting in heap memory corruption. This does not affect the regular uncustomized Zydis formatter, because Zydis internally doesn't use the string functions in zycore that act upon these fields. However, because the zycore string functions are the intended way to work with the formatter buffer for users of the library that wish to extend the formatter, we still consider this to be a vulnerability in Zydis. This bug is patched starting in version 3.2.1. As a workaround, users may refrain from using zycore string functions in their formatter hooks until updating to a patched version.\n\n- CVE-2021-21140: Uninitialized use in USB in Google Chrome prior to 88.0.4324.96 allowed a local attacker to potentially perform out of bounds memory access via via a USB device.\n\n- CVE-2021-44003: A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V13.2.0.5), Teamcenter Visualization (All versions < V13.2.0.5).

Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must open a malicious file.\n\n- CVE-2022-28488: The function wav_format_write in libwav.c in libwav through 2017-04-20 has an Use of Uninitialized Variable vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-31026: Trilogy is a client library for MySQL. When authenticating, a malicious server could return a specially crafted authentication packet, causing the client to read and return up to 12 bytes of data from an uninitialized variable in stack memory. Users of the trilogy gem should upgrade to version 2.1.1 This issue can be avoided by only connecting to trusted servers.\n\n- CVE-2022-34390: Dell BIOS contains a use of uninitialized variable vulnerability. A local authenticated malicious user may potentially exploit this vulnerability by using an SMI to gain arbitrary code execution in SMRAM.\n\n- CVE-2022-47012: Use of uninitialized variable in function gen_eth_recv in GNS3 dynamips 0.2.21.\n\n- CVE-2022-40768: drivers/scsi/stex.c in the Linux kernel through 5.19.9 allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory because stex_queuecommand_lck lacks a memset for the PASSTHRU_CMD case.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-908 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-665 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-665 (ChildOf)",

Versions prior to 4.9 are vulnerable to an Out-of-bounds read. While processing the L2CAP protocol, the Bluetooth Low Energy stack of Contiki-NG needs to map an incoming channel ID to its metadata structure. While looking up the corresponding channel structure in get_channel_for_cid (in os/net/mac/ble/ble-l2cap.c), a bounds check is performed on the incoming channel ID, which is meant to ensure that the channel ID does not exceed the maximum number of supported channels.However, an integer truncation issue leads to only the lowest byte of the channel ID to be checked, which leads to an incomplete out-of-bounds check. A crafted channel ID leads to out-of-bounds memory to be read and written with attacker-controlled data. The vulnerability has been patched in the \"develop\" branch of Contiki-NG, and will be included in release 4.9. As a workaround, Users can apply the patch in Contiki-NG pull request 2081 on GitHub.\n\n- CVE-2022-42324: Oxenstored 32->31 bit integer truncation issues Integers in Ocaml are 63 or 31 bits of signed precision. The Ocaml Xenbus library takes a C uint32_t out of the ring and casts it directly to an Ocaml integer. In 64-bit Ocaml builds this is fine, but in 32-bit builds, it truncates off the most significant bit, and then creates unsigned/signed confusion in the remainder. This in turn can feed a negative value into logic not expecting a negative value, resulting in unexpected exceptions being thrown. The unexpected exception is not handled suitably, creating a busy-loop trying (and failing) to take the bad packet out of the xenstore ring.\n\n- CVE-2022-34169: The Apache Xalan Java XSLT library is vulnerable to an integer truncation issue when processing malicious XSLT stylesheets.

In code prior to the `8c0eca3` commit h2o may attempt to access uninitialized memory. When receiving QUIC frames in certain order, HTTP/3 server-side implementation of h2o can be misguided to treat uninitialized memory as HTTP/3 frames that have been received. When h2o is used as a reverse proxy, an attacker can abuse this vulnerability to send internal state of h2o to backend servers controlled by the attacker or third party. Also, if there is an HTTP endpoint that reflects the traffic sent from the client, an attacker can use that reflector to obtain internal state of h2o. This internal state includes traffic of other connections in unencrypted form and TLS session tickets. This vulnerability exists in h2o server with HTTP/3 support, between commit 93af138 and d1f0f65. None of the released versions of h2o are affected by this vulnerability. There are no known workarounds. Users of unreleased versions of h2o using HTTP/3 are advised to upgrade immediately.\n\n- CVE-2021-39671: In code generated by aidl_const_expressions.cpp, there is a possible out of bounds read due to uninitialized data.

In versions prior to 0.14.0 Elvish's web UI backend (started by `elvish -web`) hosts an endpoint that allows executing the code sent from the web UI. The backend does not check the origin of requests correctly. As a result, if the user has the web UI backend open and visits a compromised or malicious website, the website can send arbitrary code to the endpoint in localhost. All Elvish releases from 0.14.0 onward no longer include the the web UI, although it is still possible for the user to build a version from source that includes the web UI. The issue can be patched for previous versions by removing the web UI (found in web, pkg/web or pkg/prog/web, depending on the exact version).\n\n- CVE-2021-1231: A vulnerability in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) for Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to disable switching on a small form-factor pluggable (SFP) interface. This vulnerability is due to incomplete validation of the source of a received LLDP packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LLDP packet on an SFP interface to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to disable switching on the SFP interface, which could disrupt network traffic.\n\n- CVE-2021-41158: FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. Prior to version 1.10.7, an attacker can perform a SIP digest leak attack against FreeSWITCH and receive the challenge response of a gateway configured on the FreeSWITCH server. This is done by challenging FreeSWITCH's SIP requests with the realm set to that of the gateway, thus forcing FreeSWITCH to respond with the challenge response which is based on the password of that targeted gateway. Abuse of this vulnerability allows attackers to potentially recover gateway passwords by performing a fast offline password cracking attack on the challenge response. The attacker does not require special network privileges, such as the ability to sniff the FreeSWITCH's network traffic, to exploit this issue. Instead, what is required for this attack to work is the ability to cause the victim server to send SIP request messages to the malicious party. Additionally, to exploit this issue, the attacker needs to specify the correct realm which might in some cases be considered secret. However, because many gateways are actually public, this information can easily be retrieved. The vulnerability appears to be due to the code which handles challenges in `sofia_reg.c`, `sofia_reg_handle_sip_r_challenge()` which does not check if the challenge is originating from the actual gateway. The lack of these checks allows arbitrary UACs (and gateways) to challenge any request sent by FreeSWITCH with the realm of the gateway being targeted. This issue is patched in version 10.10.7. Maintainers recommend that one should create an association between a SIP session for each gateway and its realm to make a check be put into place for this association when responding to challenges.\n\n- CVE-2021-4024: A flaw was found in podman. The `podman machine` function (used to create and manage Podman virtual machine containing a Podman process) spawns a `gvproxy` process on the host system. The `gvproxy` API is accessible on port 7777 on all IP addresses on the host. If that port is open on the host's firewall, an attacker can potentially use the `gvproxy` API to forward ports on the host to ports in the VM, making private services on the VM accessible to the network. This issue could be also used to interrupt the host's services by forwarding all ports to the VM.\n\n- CVE-2021-45441: A origin validation error vulnerability in Trend Micro Apex One (on-prem and SaaS) could allow a local attacker drop and manipulate a specially crafted file to issue commands over a certain pipe and elevate to a higher level of privileges. Please note: an attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-25146: The Remote App module in Liferay Portal Liferay Portal v7.4.3.4 through v7.4.3.8 and Liferay DXP 7.4 before update 5 does not check if the origin of event messages it receives matches the origin of the Remote App, allowing attackers to exfiltrate the CSRF token via a crafted event message.\n\n- CVE-2022-41924: A vulnerability identified in the Tailscale Windows client allows a malicious website to reconfigure the Tailscale daemon `tailscaled`, which can then be used to remotely execute code. In the Tailscale Windows client, the local API was bound to a local TCP socket, and communicated with the Windows client GUI in cleartext with no Host header verification. This allowed an attacker-controlled website visited by the node to rebind DNS to an attacker-controlled DNS server, and then make local API requests in the client, including changing the coordination server to an attacker-controlled coordination server. An attacker-controlled coordination server can send malicious URL responses to the client, including pushing executables or installing an SMB share. These allow the attacker to remotely execute code on the node. All Windows clients prior to version v.1.32.3 are affected. If you are running Tailscale on Windows, upgrade to v1.32.3 or later to remediate the issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-38507: The Opportunistic Encryption feature of HTTP2 (RFC 8164) allows a connection to be transparently upgraded to TLS while retaining the visual properties of an HTTP connection, including being same-origin with unencrypted connections on port 80. However, if a second encrypted port on the same IP address (e.g. port 8443) did not opt-in to opportunistic encryption; a network attacker could forward a connection from the browser to port 443 to port 8443, causing the browser to treat the content of port 8443 as same-origin with HTTP. This was resolved by disabling the Opportunistic Encryption feature, which had low usage. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.\n\n- CVE-2022-24762: sysend.js is a library that allows a user to send messages between pages that are open in the same browser. Users that use cross-origin communication may have their communications intercepted. Impact is limited by the communication occurring in the same browser. This issue has been patched in sysend.js version 1.10.0. The only currently known workaround is to avoid sending communications that a user does not want to have intercepted via sysend messages.\n\n- CVE-2021-33959: Plex media server 1.21 and before is vulnerable to ddos reflection attack via plex service.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-345 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-345 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",

Many internal data structures also require this initialize / dispose discipline, but not all of them. When the \"soft reset\" feature was implemented, the libxl__domain_suspend_state structure didn't require any initialization or disposal. At some point later, an initialization function was introduced for the structure; but the \"soft reset\" path wasn't refactored to call the initialization function. When a guest nwo initiates a \"soft reboot\", uninitialized data structure leads to an assert() when later code finds the structure in an unexpected state. The effect of this is to crash the process monitoring the guest. How this affects the system depends on the structure of the toolstack. For xl, this will have no security-relevant effect: every VM has its own independent monitoring process, which contains no state. The domain in question will hang in a crashed state, but can be destroyed by `xl destroy` just like any other non-cooperating domain. For daemon-based toolstacks linked against libxl, such as libvirt, this will crash the toolstack, losing the state of any in-progress operations (localized DoS), and preventing further administrator operations unless the daemon is configured to restart automatically (system-wide DoS). If crashes \"leak\" resources, then repeated crashes could use up resources, also causing a system-wide DoS.\n\n- CVE-2021-23386: This affects the package dns-packet before 5.2.2. It creates buffers with allocUnsafe and does not always fill them before forming network packets. This can expose internal application memory over unencrypted network when querying crafted invalid domain names.\n\n- CVE-2021-26333: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in AMD Platform Security Processor (PSP) chipset driver.

If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2022-3979:** Chain: data visualization program written in PHP uses the \"!=\" operator instead of the type-strict \"!==\" operator (CWE-480) when validating hash values, potentially leading to an incorrect type conversion (CWE-704)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-194: Unexpected Sign Extension\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an operation on a number that causes it to be sign extended when it is transformed into a larger data type. When the original number is negative, this can produce unexpected values that lead to resultant weaknesses.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-681\nChildOf -> CWE-681\nChildOf -> CWE-681\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Sign extension errors can lead to buffer overflows and other memory-based problems. They are also likely to be factors in other weaknesses that are not based on memory operations, but rely on numeric calculation.\n\n**[Maintenance]** This entry is closely associated with signed-to-unsigned conversion errors (CWE-195) and other numeric errors. These relationships need to be more closely examined within CWE.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2018-10887:** Chain: unexpected sign extension (CWE-194) leads to integer overflow (CWE-190), causing an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)\n- **CVE-1999-0234:** Sign extension error produces -1 value that is treated as a command separator, enabling OS command injection.\n- **CVE-2003-0161:** Product uses \"char\" type for input character. When char is implemented as a signed type, ASCII value 0xFF (255), a sign extension produces a -1 value that is treated as a program-specific separator value, effectively disabling a length check and leading to a buffer overflow. This is also a multiple interpretation error.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOOB read: Shorthand for \"Out of bounds\" read\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-1018:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to read 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.\n- **CVE-2020-11899:** Out-of-bounds read in IP stack used in embedded systems, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: \"Heartbleed\" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nMemory Corruption: Often used to describe the consequences of writing to memory outside the bounds of a buffer, or to memory that is otherwise invalid.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-1017:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to write 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.\n- **CVE-2021-21220:** Chain: insufficient input validation (CWE-20) in browser allows heap corruption (CWE-787), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe code uses a variable that has not been initialized, leading to unpredictable or unintended results.\n\n### Extended Description\nIn some languages such as C and C++, stack variables are not initialized by default. They generally contain junk data with the contents of stack memory before the function was invoked. An attacker can sometimes control or read these contents. In other languages or conditions, a variable that is not explicitly initialized can be given a default value that has security implications, depending on the logic of the program. The presence of an uninitialized variable can sometimes indicate a typographic error in the code.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-908\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nChildOf -> CWE-665\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n- **CVE-2008-3688:** Chain: A denial of service may be caused by an uninitialized variable (CWE-457) allowing an infinite loop (CWE-835) resulting from a connection to an unresponsive server.\n- **CVE-2008-0081:** Uninitialized variable leads to code execution in popular desktop application.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis typically occurs when the pointer or its index is incremented to a position beyond the bounds of the buffer or when pointer arithmetic results in a position outside of the valid memory location to name a few. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-125\nChildOf -> CWE-788\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** These problems may be resultant from missing sentinel values (CWE-463) or trusting a user-influenced input length variable.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-1733:** Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code\n- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: \"Heartbleed\" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.\n- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nAny condition where the attacker has the ability to write an arbitrary value to an arbitrary location, often as the result of a buffer overflow.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-787\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis typically occurs when a pointer or its index is decremented to a position before the buffer, when pointer arithmetic results in a position before the beginning of the valid memory location, or when a negative index is used.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nbuffer underrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term \"buffer underrun\". \"Buffer underflow\" is more commonly used, although both terms are also sometimes used to describe a buffer under-read (CWE-127).\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-786\nChildOf -> CWE-787\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This could be resultant from several errors, including a bad offset or an array index that decrements before the beginning of the buffer (see CWE-129).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-24018:** buffer underwrite in firmware verification routine allows code execution via a crafted firmware image\n- **CVE-2002-2227:** Unchecked length of SSLv2 challenge value leads to buffer underflow.\n- **CVE-2007-4580:** Buffer underflow from a small size value with a large buffer (length parameter inconsistency, CWE-130)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nTruncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a primitive is cast to a smaller primitive, the high order bits of the large value are lost in the conversion, potentially resulting in an unexpected value that is not equal to the original value. This value may be required as an index into a buffer, a loop iterator, or simply necessary state data. In any case, the value cannot be trusted and the system will be in an undefined state. While this method may be employed viably to isolate the low bits of a value, this usage is rare, and truncation usually implies that an implementation error has occurred.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-681\nChildOf -> CWE-681\nChildOf -> CWE-681\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-195\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-196\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-192\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-194\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** This weakness has traditionally been under-studied and under-reported, although vulnerabilities in popular software have been published in 2008 and 2009.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-17087:** Chain: integer truncation (CWE-197) causes small buffer allocation (CWE-131) leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) in kernel pool, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2009-0231:** Integer truncation of length value leads to heap-based buffer overflow.\n- **CVE-2008-3282:** Size of a particular type changes for 64-bit platforms, leading to an integer truncation in document processor causes incorrect index to be generated.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses or accesses a resource that has not been initialized.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a resource has not been properly initialized, the product may behave unexpectedly. This may lead to a crash or invalid memory access, but the consequences vary depending on the type of resource and how it is used within the product.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nChildOf -> CWE-665\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-9805:** Chain: Creation of the packet client occurs before initialization is complete (CWE-696) resulting in a read from uninitialized memory (CWE-908), causing memory corruption.\n- **CVE-2008-4197:** Use of uninitialized memory may allow code execution.\n- **CVE-2008-2934:** Free of an uninitialized pointer leads to crash and possible code execution.\n\n",

It translates a target-independent intermediate representation into executable machine code. There is a bug in 0.73 of the Cranelift x64 backend that can create a scenario that could result in a potential sandbox escape in a Wasm program. This bug was introduced in the new backend on 2020-09-08 and first included in a release on 2020-09-30, but the new backend was not the default prior to 0.73. The recently-released version 0.73 with default settings, and prior versions with an explicit build flag to select the new backend, are vulnerable. The bug in question performs a sign-extend instead of a zero-extend on a value loaded from the stack, under a specific set of circumstances. If those circumstances occur, the bug could allow access to memory addresses upto 2GiB before the start of the Wasm program heap. If the heap bound is larger than 2GiB, then it would be possible to read memory from a computable range dependent on the size of the heaps bound. The impact of this bug is highly dependent on heap implementation, specifically: * if the heap has bounds checks, and * does not rely exclusively on guard pages, and * the heap bound is 2GiB or smaller * then this bug cannot be used to reach memory from another Wasm program heap. The impact of the vulnerability is mitigated if there is no memory mapped in the range accessible using this bug, for example, if there is a 2 GiB guard region before the Wasm program heap. The bug in question performs a sign-extend instead of a zero-extend on a value loaded from the stack, when the register allocator reloads a spilled integer value narrower than 64 bits. This interacts poorly with another optimization: the instruction selector elides a 32-to-64-bit zero-extend operator when we know that an instruction producing a 32-bit value actually zeros the upper 32 bits of its destination register. Hence, we rely on these zeroed bits, but the type of the value is still i32, and the spill/reload reconstitutes those bits as the sign extension of the i32\u2019s MSB. The issue would thus occur when: * An i32 value in a Wasm program is greater than or equal to 0x8000_0000; * The value is spilled and reloaded by the register allocator due to high register pressure in the program between the value\u2019s definition and its use; * The value is produced by an instruction that we know to be \u201cspecial\u201d in that it zeroes the upper 32 bits of its destination: add, sub, mul, and, or; * The value is then zero-extended to 64 bits in the Wasm program; * The resulting 64-bit value is used. Under these circumstances there is a potential sandbox escape when the i32 value is a pointer. The usual code emitted for heap accesses zero-extends the Wasm heap address, adds it to a 64-bit heap base, and accesses the resulting address. If the zero-extend becomes a sign-extend, the program could reach backward and access memory up to 2GiB before the start of its heap. In addition to assessing the nature of the code generation bug in Cranelift, we have also determined that under specific circumstances, both Lucet and Wasmtime using this version of Cranelift may be exploitable.

The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNorm` is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. If the tensors are empty, the same implementation can trigger undefined behavior by dereferencing null pointers. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/57d86e0db5d1365f19adcce848dfc1bf89fdd4c7/tensorflow/core/kernels/fused_batch_norm_op.cc) fails to validate that `scale`, `offset`, `mean` and `variance` (the last two only when required) all have the same number of elements as the number of channels of `x`. This results in heap out of bounds reads when the buffers backing these tensors are indexed past their boundary. If the tensors are empty, the validation mentioned in the above paragraph would also trigger and prevent the undefined behavior. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29988: Firefox incorrectly treated an inline list-item element as a block element, resulting in an out of bounds read or memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

A vulnerability involving out-of-bounds read and integer overflow to buffer overflow exists starting with version 2.2 and prior to versions 5.0.13, 6.0.15, and 6.2.5. On 32-bit systems, Redis `*BIT*` command are vulnerable to integer overflow that can potentially be exploited to corrupt the heap, leak arbitrary heap contents or trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter to a very large value and constructing specially crafted commands bit commands. This problem only affects Redis on 32-bit platforms, or compiled as a 32-bit binary. Redis versions 5.0.`3m 6.0.15, and 6.2.5 contain patches for this issue. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the `redis-server` executable is to prevent users from modifying the `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.\n\n- CVE-2021-3409: The patch for CVE-2020-17380/CVE-2020-25085 was found to be ineffective, thus making QEMU vulnerable to the out-of-bounds read/write access issues previously found in the SDHCI controller emulation code. This flaw allows a malicious privileged guest to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service or potential code execution.

An attacker who is able to supply a crafted file to be processed by an application linked with the affected functionality of libxml2 could trigger an out-of-bounds read. The most likely impact of this flaw is to application availability, with some potential impact to confidentiality and integrity if an attacker is able to use memory information to further exploit the application.\n\n- CVE-2021-3712: ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2y).\n\n- CVE-2021-31174: Microsoft Excel Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-27408: The affected product is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read, which can cause information leakage leading to arbitrary code execution if chained to the out-of-bounds write vulnerability on the Welch Allyn medical device management tools (Welch Allyn Service Tool: versions prior to v1.10, Welch Allyn Connex Device Integration Suite \u2013 Network Connectivity Engine (NCE): versions prior to v5.3, Welch Allyn Software Development Kit (SDK): versions prior to v3.2, Welch Allyn Connex Central Station (CS): versions prior to v1.8.6, Welch Allyn Service Monitor: versions prior to v1.7.0.0, Welch Allyn Connex Vital Signs Monitor (CVSM): versions prior to v2.43.02, Welch Allyn Connex Integrated Wall System (CIWS): versions prior to v2.43.02, Welch Allyn Connex Spot Monitor (CSM): versions prior to v1.52, Welch Allyn Spot Vital Signs 4400 Device (Spot 4400) / Welch Allyn Spot 4400 Vital Signs Extended Care Device: versions prior to v1.11.00).\n\n- CVE-2021-27791: The function that is used to parse the Authentication header in Brocade Fabric OS Web application service before Brocade Fabric OS v9.0.1a and v8.2.3a fails to properly process a malformed authentication header from the client, resulting in reading memory addresses outside the intended range.

Prior to version 2.0.2, there is a bug in Wasmtime's implementation of its pooling instance allocator when the allocator is configured to give WebAssembly instances a maximum of zero pages of memory. In this configuration, the virtual memory mapping for WebAssembly memories did not meet the compiler-required configuration requirements for safely executing WebAssembly modules. Wasmtime's default settings require virtual memory page faults to indicate that wasm reads/writes are out-of-bounds, but the pooling allocator's configuration would not create an appropriate virtual memory mapping for this meaning out of bounds reads/writes can successfully read/write memory unrelated to the wasm sandbox within range of the base address of the memory mapping created by the pooling allocator. This bug is not applicable with the default settings of the `wasmtime` crate. This bug can only be triggered by setting `InstanceLimits::memory_pages` to zero. This is expected to be a very rare configuration since this means that wasm modules cannot allocate any pages of linear memory. All wasm modules produced by all current toolchains are highly likely to use linear memory, so it's expected to be unlikely that this configuration is set to zero by any production embedding of Wasmtime. This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2. This bug can be worked around by increasing the `memory_pages` allotment when configuring the pooling allocator to a value greater than zero. If an embedding wishes to still prevent memory from actually being used then the `Store::limiter` method can be used to dynamically disallow growth of memory beyond 0 bytes large. Note that the default `memory_pages` value is greater than zero.\n\n- CVE-2022-41902: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The function MakeGrapplerFunctionItem takes arguments that determine the sizes of inputs and outputs.

We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.8.4, 2.9.3, and 2.10.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-41981: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the TGA file format parser of OpenImageIO v2.3.19.0. A specially-crafted targa file can lead to out of bounds read and write on the process stack, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-4203: A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. In theory it could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext) although we are not aware of any working exploit leading to memory contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects. \n\n- CVE-2022-48303: GNU Tar through 1.34 has a one-byte out-of-bounds read that results in use of uninitialized memory for a conditional jump.

The implementation of `tf.io.decode_raw` produces incorrect results and crashes the Python interpreter when combining `fixed_length` and wider datatypes. The implementation of the padded version(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc) is buggy due to a confusion about pointer arithmetic rules. First, the code computes(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L61) the width of each output element by dividing the `fixed_length` value to the size of the type argument. The `fixed_length` argument is also used to determine the size needed for the output tensor(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L63-L79). This is followed by reencoding code(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L85-L94). The erroneous code is the last line above: it is moving the `out_data` pointer by `fixed_length * sizeof(T)` bytes whereas it only copied at most `fixed_length` bytes from the input. This results in parts of the input not being decoded into the output. Furthermore, because the pointer advance is far wider than desired, this quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data. This OOB write leads to interpreter crash in the reproducer mentioned here, but more severe attacks can be mounted too, given that this gadget allows writing to periodically placed locations in memory. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29947: Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 87.

They generally contain junk data with the contents of stack memory before the function was invoked. An attacker can sometimes control or read these contents. In other languages or conditions, a variable that is not explicitly initialized can be given a default value that has security implications, depending on the logic of the program. The presence of an uninitialized variable can sometimes indicate a typographic error in the code.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2019-15900: Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n\n- CVE-2008-3688: Chain: A denial of service may be caused by an uninitialized variable (CWE-457) allowing an infinite loop (CWE-835) resulting from a connection to an unresponsive server.\n\n- CVE-2008-0081: Uninitialized variable leads to code execution in popular desktop application.\n\n- CVE-2007-4682: Crafted input triggers dereference of an uninitialized object pointer.\n\n- CVE-2007-3468: Crafted audio file triggers crash when an uninitialized variable is used.\n\n- CVE-2007-2728: Uninitialized random seed variable used.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1619: A vulnerability in the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) function of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass NETCONF or RESTCONF authentication and do either of the following: Install, manipulate, or delete the configuration of an affected device Cause memory corruption that results in a denial of service (DoS) on an affected device This vulnerability is due to an uninitialized variable. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of NETCONF or RESTCONF requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use NETCONF or RESTCONF to install, manipulate, or delete the configuration of a network device or to corrupt memory on the device, resulting a DoS.\n\n- CVE-2021-41253: Zydis is an x86/x86-64 disassembler library. Users of Zydis versions v3.2.0 and older that use the string functions provided in `zycore` in order to append untrusted user data to the formatter buffer within their custom formatter hooks can run into heap buffer overflows. Older versions of Zydis failed to properly initialize the string object within the formatter buffer, forgetting to initialize a few fields, leaving their value to chance. This could then in turn cause zycore functions like `ZyanStringAppend` to make incorrect calculations for the new target size, resulting in heap memory corruption. This does not affect the regular uncustomized Zydis formatter, because Zydis internally doesn't use the string functions in zycore that act upon these fields. However, because the zycore string functions are the intended way to work with the formatter buffer for users of the library that wish to extend the formatter, we still consider this to be a vulnerability in Zydis. This bug is patched starting in version 3.2.1. As a workaround, users may refrain from using zycore string functions in their formatter hooks until updating to a patched version.\n\n- CVE-2021-21140: Uninitialized use in USB in Google Chrome prior to 88.0.4324.96 allowed a local attacker to potentially perform out of bounds memory access via via a USB device.\n\n- CVE-2021-44003: A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V13.2.0.5), Teamcenter Visualization (All versions < V13.2.0.5).

Versions prior to 4.9 are vulnerable to an Out-of-bounds read. While processing the L2CAP protocol, the Bluetooth Low Energy stack of Contiki-NG needs to map an incoming channel ID to its metadata structure. While looking up the corresponding channel structure in get_channel_for_cid (in os/net/mac/ble/ble-l2cap.c), a bounds check is performed on the incoming channel ID, which is meant to ensure that the channel ID does not exceed the maximum number of supported channels.However, an integer truncation issue leads to only the lowest byte of the channel ID to be checked, which leads to an incomplete out-of-bounds check. A crafted channel ID leads to out-of-bounds memory to be read and written with attacker-controlled data. The vulnerability has been patched in the \"develop\" branch of Contiki-NG, and will be included in release 4.9. As a workaround, Users can apply the patch in Contiki-NG pull request 2081 on GitHub.\n\n- CVE-2022-42324: Oxenstored 32->31 bit integer truncation issues Integers in Ocaml are 63 or 31 bits of signed precision. The Ocaml Xenbus library takes a C uint32_t out of the ring and casts it directly to an Ocaml integer. In 64-bit Ocaml builds this is fine, but in 32-bit builds, it truncates off the most significant bit, and then creates unsigned/signed confusion in the remainder. This in turn can feed a negative value into logic not expecting a negative value, resulting in unexpected exceptions being thrown. The unexpected exception is not handled suitably, creating a busy-loop trying (and failing) to take the bad packet out of the xenstore ring.\n\n- CVE-2022-34169: The Apache Xalan Java XSLT library is vulnerable to an integer truncation issue when processing malicious XSLT stylesheets. This can be used to corrupt Java class files generated by the internal XSLTC compiler and execute arbitrary Java bytecode. Users are recommended to update to version 2.7.3 or later.

In code prior to the `8c0eca3` commit h2o may attempt to access uninitialized memory. When receiving QUIC frames in certain order, HTTP/3 server-side implementation of h2o can be misguided to treat uninitialized memory as HTTP/3 frames that have been received. When h2o is used as a reverse proxy, an attacker can abuse this vulnerability to send internal state of h2o to backend servers controlled by the attacker or third party. Also, if there is an HTTP endpoint that reflects the traffic sent from the client, an attacker can use that reflector to obtain internal state of h2o. This internal state includes traffic of other connections in unencrypted form and TLS session tickets. This vulnerability exists in h2o server with HTTP/3 support, between commit 93af138 and d1f0f65.

In versions prior to 0.14.0 Elvish's web UI backend (started by `elvish -web`) hosts an endpoint that allows executing the code sent from the web UI. The backend does not check the origin of requests correctly. As a result, if the user has the web UI backend open and visits a compromised or malicious website, the website can send arbitrary code to the endpoint in localhost. All Elvish releases from 0.14.0 onward no longer include the the web UI, although it is still possible for the user to build a version from source that includes the web UI. The issue can be patched for previous versions by removing the web UI (found in web, pkg/web or pkg/prog/web, depending on the exact version).\n\n- CVE-2021-1231: A vulnerability in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) for Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to disable switching on a small form-factor pluggable (SFP) interface. This vulnerability is due to incomplete validation of the source of a received LLDP packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LLDP packet on an SFP interface to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to disable switching on the SFP interface, which could disrupt network traffic.\n\n- CVE-2021-41158: FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. Prior to version 1.10.7, an attacker can perform a SIP digest leak attack against FreeSWITCH and receive the challenge response of a gateway configured on the FreeSWITCH server. This is done by challenging FreeSWITCH's SIP requests with the realm set to that of the gateway, thus forcing FreeSWITCH to respond with the challenge response which is based on the password of that targeted gateway. Abuse of this vulnerability allows attackers to potentially recover gateway passwords by performing a fast offline password cracking attack on the challenge response. The attacker does not require special network privileges, such as the ability to sniff the FreeSWITCH's network traffic, to exploit this issue. Instead, what is required for this attack to work is the ability to cause the victim server to send SIP request messages to the malicious party. Additionally, to exploit this issue, the attacker needs to specify the correct realm which might in some cases be considered secret. However, because many gateways are actually public, this information can easily be retrieved. The vulnerability appears to be due to the code which handles challenges in `sofia_reg.c`, `sofia_reg_handle_sip_r_challenge()` which does not check if the challenge is originating from the actual gateway. The lack of these checks allows arbitrary UACs (and gateways) to challenge any request sent by FreeSWITCH with the realm of the gateway being targeted. This issue is patched in version 10.10.7. Maintainers recommend that one should create an association between a SIP session for each gateway and its realm to make a check be put into place for this association when responding to challenges.\n\n- CVE-2021-4024: A flaw was found in podman. The `podman machine` function (used to create and manage Podman virtual machine containing a Podman process) spawns a `gvproxy` process on the host system. The `gvproxy` API is accessible on port 7777 on all IP addresses on the host. If that port is open on the host's firewall, an attacker can potentially use the `gvproxy` API to forward ports on the host to ports in the VM, making private services on the VM accessible to the network. This issue could be also used to interrupt the host's services by forwarding all ports to the VM.\n\n- CVE-2021-45441: A origin validation error vulnerability in Trend Micro Apex One (on-prem and SaaS) could allow a local attacker drop and manipulate a specially crafted file to issue commands over a certain pipe and elevate to a higher level of privileges. Please note: an attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-25146: The Remote App module in Liferay Portal Liferay Portal v7.4.3.4 through v7.4.3.8 and Liferay DXP 7.4 before update 5 does not check if the origin of event messages it receives matches the origin of the Remote App, allowing attackers to exfiltrate the CSRF token via a crafted event message.\n\n- CVE-2022-41924: A vulnerability identified in the Tailscale Windows client allows a malicious website to reconfigure the Tailscale daemon `tailscaled`, which can then be used to remotely execute code. In the Tailscale Windows client, the local API was bound to a local TCP socket, and communicated with the Windows client GUI in cleartext with no Host header verification. This allowed an attacker-controlled website visited by the node to rebind DNS to an attacker-controlled DNS server, and then make local API requests in the client, including changing the coordination server to an attacker-controlled coordination server. An attacker-controlled coordination server can send malicious URL responses to the client, including pushing executables or installing an SMB share. These allow the attacker to remotely execute code on the node. All Windows clients prior to version v.1.32.3 are affected. If you are running Tailscale on Windows, upgrade to v1.32.3 or later to remediate the issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-38507: The Opportunistic Encryption feature of HTTP2 (RFC 8164) allows a connection to be transparently upgraded to TLS while retaining the visual properties of an HTTP connection, including being same-origin with unencrypted connections on port 80. However, if a second encrypted port on the same IP address (e.g. port 8443) did not opt-in to opportunistic encryption; a network attacker could forward a connection from the browser to port 443 to port 8443, causing the browser to treat the content of port 8443 as same-origin with HTTP. This was resolved by disabling the Opportunistic Encryption feature, which had low usage. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.\n\n- CVE-2022-24762: sysend.js is a library that allows a user to send messages between pages that are open in the same browser. Users that use cross-origin communication may have their communications intercepted. Impact is limited by the communication occurring in the same browser. This issue has been patched in sysend.js version 1.10.0. The only currently known workaround is to avoid sending communications that a user does not want to have intercepted via sysend messages.\n\n- CVE-2021-33959: Plex media server 1.21 and before is vulnerable to ddos reflection attack via plex service.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-345 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-345 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",

Many internal data structures also require this initialize / dispose discipline, but not all of them. When the \"soft reset\" feature was implemented, the libxl__domain_suspend_state structure didn't require any initialization or disposal. At some point later, an initialization function was introduced for the structure; but the \"soft reset\" path wasn't refactored to call the initialization function. When a guest nwo initiates a \"soft reboot\", uninitialized data structure leads to an assert() when later code finds the structure in an unexpected state. The effect of this is to crash the process monitoring the guest. How this affects the system depends on the structure of the toolstack. For xl, this will have no security-relevant effect: every VM has its own independent monitoring process, which contains no state. The domain in question will hang in a crashed state, but can be destroyed by `xl destroy` just like any other non-cooperating domain. For daemon-based toolstacks linked against libxl, such as libvirt, this will crash the toolstack, losing the state of any in-progress operations (localized DoS), and preventing further administrator operations unless the daemon is configured to restart automatically (system-wide DoS). If crashes \"leak\" resources, then repeated crashes could use up resources, also causing a system-wide DoS.\n\n- CVE-2021-23386: This affects the package dns-packet before 5.2.2.

This issue needs to handle 'return' with proper preconditions, as it can lead to a kernel information leak problem caused by a local, unprivileged attacker.\n\n- CVE-2022-0175: A flaw was found in the VirGL virtual OpenGL renderer (virglrenderer). The virgl did not properly initialize memory when allocating a host-backed memory resource. A malicious guest could use this flaw to mmap from the guest kernel and read this uninitialized memory from the host, possibly leading to information disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2022-0382: An information leak flaw was found due to uninitialized memory in the Linux kernel's TIPC protocol subsystem, in the way a user sends a TIPC datagram to one or more destinations. This flaw allows a local user to read some kernel memory. This issue is limited to no more than 7 bytes, and the user cannot control what is read. This flaw affects the Linux kernel versions prior to 5.17-rc1.\n\n- CVE-2021-0946: The method PVRSRVBridgePMRPDumpSymbolicAddr allocates puiMemspaceNameInt on the heap, fills the contents of the buffer via PMR_PDumpSymbolicAddr, and then copies the buffer to userspace. The method PMR_PDumpSymbolicAddr may fail, and if it does the buffer will be left uninitialized and despite the error will still be copied to userspace. Kernel leak of uninitialized heap data with no privs required.Product: AndroidVersions: Android SoCAndroid ID: A-236846966\n\n- CVE-2021-0947: The method PVRSRVBridgeTLDiscoverStreams allocates puiStreamsInt on the heap, fills the contents of the buffer via TLServerDiscoverStreamsKM, and then copies the buffer to userspace. The method TLServerDiscoverStreamsKM may fail for several reasons including invalid sizes. If this method fails the buffer will be left uninitialized and despite the error will still be copied to userspace. Kernel leak of uninitialized heap data with no privs required.Product: AndroidVersions: Android SoCAndroid ID: A-236838960\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-665 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-665 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-908 (CanPrecede)",
