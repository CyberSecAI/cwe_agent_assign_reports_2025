  "description": "WinZip Mark-of-the-Web Bypass Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web protection mechanism on affected installations of WinZip. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of archive files. When opening an archive that bears the Mark-of-the-Web, WinZip removes the Mark-of-the-Web from the archive file. Following extraction, the extracted files also lack the Mark-of-the-Web. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-23983.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in how WinZip handles archive files containing the Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW). When such an archive is opened, WinZip incorrectly removes the MOTW from the archive file itself. Subsequently, when files are extracted, they also lack the MOTW.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is the improper handling of MOTW by WinZip, leading to the removal of security metadata which is supposed to be applied to files originating from the internet.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to bypass MOTW protection, which is designed to prevent execution of untrusted files. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user, potentially gaining complete control of the affected system.\n*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves tricking a user into opening a specially crafted archive file. This could be done by hosting a malicious file on a website or delivering it via email.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious archive to the target user. The user must then open the malicious file, requiring user interaction, but the attacker does not need any special privileges on the system itself.\n\nThe advisory also specifies that:\n* The vulnerability is fixed in WinZip 76.8\n* The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2024-05-03\n* Credit is given to Peter Girnus (@gothburz) of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative",

  "analysis": "# Summary\n\n| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| CWE-770 | Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling | 0.8 | Base | Primary | Allowed |\n| CWE-552 | Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-770, which relates to resource management. The secondary CWE, CWE-552, is related to file access control. CWE-770 describes a scenario where resources are allocated without limits, and this can lead to issues like denial of service or bypass of security mechanisms. CWE-552 is about making files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors. These CWEs are not directly related in a parent-child or peer relationship but can be present in the same vulnerability when improper resource management (CWE-770) leads to files being inappropriately accessed (CWE-552).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe552[\"CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe552 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with WinZip's **improper handling** of the Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW). This **improper handling** allows the removal of the MOTW, which is a form of resource allocation without proper limits or throttling (CWE-770). This leads to the extracted files lacking the MOTW, making them accessible without the intended security restrictions (CWE-552). This allows an attacker to **execute arbitrary code**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the analysis considered the high-scoring CWEs from the Retriever Results, such as CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), CWE-59 (Improper Link Resolution Before File Access), and CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation). However, these did not directly address the core issue of WinZip removing the Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) from archive files. The key aspect of this vulnerability is the **improper handling** of a security mechanism (MOTW), leading to a bypass.\n\nCWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) fits because the MOTW is a resource intended to limit the execution of untrusted files. By removing it, WinZip is essentially allocating resources (file execution) without the intended limits. CWE-552 (Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties) is a secondary weakness because the extracted files, now lacking MOTW, are accessible without the intended security restrictions.\n\nThe graph relationships did not significantly influence the final selection, as the focus was on identifying the root cause based on the vulnerability description and CVE summary. The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the **improper handling** of the MOTW and the resulting accessibility of files.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n**CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**\n\n*   **Description:** The software allocates resources without imposing adequate restrictions on the quantity or rate at which those resources are allocated, which can allow an attacker to consume a large amount of resources, possibly leading to a denial of service or the circumvention of security mechanisms that depend on resource limitations.\n*   **Mapping Guidance:** Usage: Allowed\n*   **Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties**\n\n*   **Description:** The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n*   **Mapping Guidance:** Usage: Allowed\n*   **Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWEs Considered and Rejected:\n\n*   CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write): While the vulnerability leads to arbitrary code execution, it's not directly caused by an out-of-bounds write.\n*   CWE-59 (Improper Link Resolution Before File Access): This doesn't apply as the issue isn't about improper link resolution.\n*   CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation): Too generic; the vulnerability is more specific than general input validation.\n*   CWE-23 (Relative Path Traversal): Not relevant as the vulnerability doesn't involve path traversal.\n*   CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')): Not relevant as the vulnerability doesn't involve path traversal.\n*   CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource): Could be argued, but CWE-770 + CWE-552 better captures the initial resource allocation issue leading to the permission problem.\n*   CWE-1007 (Insufficient Visual Distinction of Homoglyphs Presented to User): Not applicable to this vulnerability.\n*   CWE-274 (Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges): Not the primary issue.\n*   CWE-409 (Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification)): Not relevant as the vulnerability doesn't involve compressed data handling.\n*   CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path): Not the primary issue.",
