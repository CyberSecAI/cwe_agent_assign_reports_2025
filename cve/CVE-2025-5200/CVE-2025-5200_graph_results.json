  "query": "A vulnerability was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3 and classified as problematic. This issue affects the function MDLImporterInternReadFile_Quake1 of the file assimp/code/AssetLib/MDL/MDLLoader.cpp. The manipulation leads to out-of-bounds read. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The project decided to collect all Fuzzer bugs in a main-issue to address them in the future.",
