The **CSRF** is the root cause that allows **XSS**. |\n| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The **XSS** is the resulting weakness. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship of interest is that of root cause versus impact. The vulnerability description clearly states a **CSRF** vulnerability leads to Stored **XSS**. This suggests that an attacker can leverage **CSRF** to inject malicious scripts, which are then stored and executed, leading to **XSS**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe352 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability, which allows an attacker to force a user to perform actions they did not intend to, such as injecting malicious scripts. The injected scripts are then stored and executed, leading to a Stored **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability.\n\n`CSRF` -> `XSS`\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states that a **CSRF** vulnerability allows for Stored **XSS**.
