  "description": "openHAB, a provider of open-source home automation software, has add-ons including the visualization add-on CometVisu. Prior to version 4.2.1, the proxy endpoint of openHABs CometVisu add-on can be accessed without authentication. This proxy-feature can be exploited as Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to induce GET HTTP requests to internal-only servers, in case openHAB is exposed in a non-private network. Furthermore, this proxy-feature can also be exploited as a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, as an attacker is able to re-route a request to their server and return a page with malicious JavaScript code. Since the browser receives this data directly from the openHAB CometVisu UI, this JavaScript code will be executed with the origin of the CometVisu UI. This allows an attacker to exploit call endpoints on an openHAB server even if the openHAB server is located in a private network. (e.g. by sending an openHAB admin a link that proxies malicious JavaScript.) This issue may lead up to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when chained with other vulnerabilities. Users should upgrade to version 4.2.1 of the CometVisu add-on of openHAB to receive a patch.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe root cause is an unauthenticated proxy endpoint within the CometVisu add-on for openHAB. This allows external users to make arbitrary requests to internal resources using the openHAB server as an intermediary.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The proxy endpoint allows attackers to make GET requests to internal servers that would otherwise be inaccessible from outside the network.\n*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The proxy endpoint can be exploited by an attacker to reroute requests to an attacker-controlled server, returning malicious JavaScript. Since the response is received by the browser as being from the openHAB server, the malicious JavaScript will be executed with the origin of the CometVisu UI allowing access to the openHAB server's APIs even if the openHAB server is on a private network.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **SSRF:** Attackers can potentially gather information about internal network infrastructure by making requests to internal services.\n*   **XSS:** Attackers can execute malicious JavaScript in the context of the CometVisu UI. This could allow them to perform actions on the openHAB server on behalf of the user, including manipulating system settings.\n*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This vulnerability can be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The proxy endpoint is accessible without any authentication, making it easy to exploit.\n*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker controls the target URL through the `url` query parameter of the `/proxy` endpoint.\n*   **Arbitrary Request Injection:** The proxy endpoint relays the response received from the specified URL, allowing for the injection of malicious content.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker must have network access to the openHAB server with the vulnerable CometVisu addon.\n*   The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs to exploit the proxy endpoint, either for SSRF or XSS attacks.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is located in the `ProxyResource.java` file.\n*   The issue was discovered using CodeQL's Server-side request forgery query.\n*   The fix for this vulnerability was introduced in version 4.2.1.\n*   The commit `630e8525835c698cf58856aa43782d92b18087f2` addresses the issue, including requiring authentication for some REST endpoints and adding some sanity checks.\n\n**In summary, this CVE describes a significant vulnerability in the openHAB CometVisu add-on that could allow attackers to perform SSRF and XSS attacks due to an unauthenticated proxy endpoint. This could lead to severe consequences, including RCE when chained with other vulnerabilities.**",

The relationship between CWE-306 and CWE-918 is that the **missing authentication** (CWE-306) is a prerequisite for the SSRF vulnerability (CWE-918). Similarly, the **missing authentication** facilitates the XSS vulnerability (CWE-79), as it allows an attacker to control the response and inject malicious JavaScript. The abstraction levels are appropriate, with CWE-306 and CWE-918 being Base-level CWEs that accurately represent the root cause and the resulting vulnerability. CWE-79 is also a Base-level CWE, describing the XSS issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe918 -- REQUIRES --> cwe306\n    cwe79 -- REQUIRES --> cwe306\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe918,cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing authentication** for the proxy endpoint (CWE-306)\n2.  **Weakness 1:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to the ability to make requests to internal servers (CWE-918)\n3.  **Weakness 2:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the ability to re-route requests and inject malicious JavaScript (CWE-79)\n4.  **Impact:** Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) when chained with other vulnerabilities.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is heavily based on the provided vulnerability description, particularly the keyphrase analysis. The primary **root cause** is clearly the **missing authentication** (CWE-306) on the proxy endpoint. The SSRF (CWE-918) and XSS (CWE-79) vulnerabilities are consequences of this **missing authentication**. The relationship graph and the vulnerability chain helped to clarify the interaction between these weaknesses. The selected CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity, providing a clear and accurate representation of the vulnerability. The evidence supporting the primary CWE is the statement \"the proxy endpoint of openHABs CometVisu add-on can be accessed without authentication.\" The evidence for CWE-918 is \"This proxy-feature can be exploited as Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to induce GET HTTP requests to internal-only servers\". The evidence for CWE-79 is \"this proxy-feature can also be exploited as a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, as an attacker is able to re-route a request to their server and return a page with malicious JavaScript code\".\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected as CWE-79 is the more general case and seems more appropriate*\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because a more specific CWE ID is a better fit.*\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because there is **missing authentication** rather than an incorrect implementation of authentication*\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
