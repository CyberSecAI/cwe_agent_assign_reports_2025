  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-42467', description='openHAB, a provider of open-source home automation software, has add-ons including the visualization add-on CometVisu. Prior to version 4.2.1, the proxy endpoint of openHABs CometVisu add-on can be accessed without authentication. This proxy-feature can be exploited as Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to induce GET HTTP requests to internal-only servers, in case openHAB is exposed in a non-private network. Furthermore, this proxy-feature can also be exploited as a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, as an attacker is able to re-route a request to their server and return a page with malicious JavaScript code. Since the browser receives this data directly from the openHAB CometVisu UI, this JavaScript code will be executed with the origin of the CometVisu UI. This allows an attacker to exploit call endpoints on an openHAB server even if the openHAB server is located in a private network. (e.g. by sending an openHAB admin a link that proxies malicious JavaScript.) This issue may lead up to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when chained with other vulnerabilities. Users should upgrade to version 4.2.1 of the CometVisu add-on of openHAB to receive a patch.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'missing authentication', 'weakness': ['server-side request forgery', 'cross-site scripting'], 'impact': 'remote code execution', 'vector': 'malicious JavaScript code', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'openHAB CometVisu add-on', 'version': 'prior to 4.2.1', 'component': 'proxy endpoint'}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**Root Cause:**\\n\\nThe root cause is an unauthenticated proxy endpoint within the CometVisu add-on for openHAB. This allows external users to make arbitrary requests to internal resources using the openHAB server as an intermediary.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n\\n*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The proxy endpoint allows attackers to make GET requests to internal servers that would otherwise be inaccessible from outside the network.\\n*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The proxy endpoint can be exploited by an attacker to reroute requests to an attacker-controlled server, returning malicious JavaScript. Since the response is received by the browser as being from the openHAB server, the malicious JavaScript will be executed with the origin of the CometVisu UI allowing access to the openHAB server's APIs even if the openHAB server is on a private network.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n\\n*   **SSRF:** Attackers can potentially gather information about internal network infrastructure by making requests to internal services.\\n*   **XSS:** Attackers can execute malicious JavaScript in the context of the CometVisu UI. This could allow them to perform actions on the openHAB server on behalf of the user, including manipulating system settings.\\n*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This vulnerability can be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n\\n*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The proxy endpoint is accessible without any authentication, making it easy to exploit.\\n*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker controls the target URL through the `url` query parameter of the `/proxy` endpoint.\\n*   **Arbitrary Request Injection:** The proxy endpoint relays the response received from the specified URL, allowing for the injection of malicious content.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n\\n*   The attacker must have network access to the openHAB server with the vulnerable CometVisu addon.\\n*   The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs to exploit the proxy endpoint, either for SSRF or XSS attacks.\\n\\n**Additional Details:**\\n\\n*   The vulnerability is located in the `ProxyResource.java` file.\\n*   The issue was discovered using CodeQL's Server-side request forgery query.\\n*   The fix for this vulnerability was introduced in version 4.2.1.\\n*   The commit `630e8525835c698cf58856aa43782d92b18087f2` addresses the issue, including requiring authentication for some REST endpoints and adding some sanity checks.\\n\\n**In summary, this CVE describes a significant vulnerability in the openHAB CometVisu add-on that could allow attackers to perform SSRF and XSS attacks due to an unauthenticated proxy endpoint. This could lead to severe consequences, including RCE when chained with other vulnerabilities.**\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [],

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    openHAB, a provider of open-source home automation software, has add-ons including the visualization add-on CometVisu. Prior to version 4.2.1, the proxy endpoint of openHABs CometVisu add-on can be accessed without authentication. This proxy-feature can be exploited as Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to induce GET HTTP requests to internal-only servers, in case openHAB is exposed in a non-private network. Furthermore, this proxy-feature can also be exploited as a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, as an attacker is able to re-route a request to their server and return a page with malicious JavaScript code. Since the browser receives this data directly from the openHAB CometVisu UI, this JavaScript code will be executed with the origin of the CometVisu UI. This allows an attacker to exploit call endpoints on an openHAB server even if the openHAB server is located in a private network. (e.g. by sending an openHAB admin a link that proxies malicious JavaScript.) This issue may lead up to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when chained with other vulnerabilities. Users should upgrade to version 4.2.1 of the CometVisu add-on of openHAB to receive a patch.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'missing authentication'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
