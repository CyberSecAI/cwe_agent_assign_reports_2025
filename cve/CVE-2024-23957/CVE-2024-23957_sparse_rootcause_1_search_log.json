  "query": "Autel MaxiCharger AC Elite Business C50 DLB_HostHeartBeat Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Autel MaxiCharger AC Elite Business C50 charging stations. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the DLB_HostHeartBeat handler of the DLB protocol implementation. When parsing an AES key, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device. Was ZDI-CAN-23241",
