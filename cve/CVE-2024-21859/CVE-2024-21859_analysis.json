The evidence indicates an \"Improper buffer restrictions\", suggesting potential out-of-bounds access. CWE-497 describes the impact of the vulnerability, which is information exposure.

This could potentially lead to out-of-bounds memory access, and ultimately information disclosure.\n\nThe retriever results suggest CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) as the closest match.
