  "description": "changedetection.io is a free open source web page change detection, website watcher, restock monitor and notification service. **Improper input validation** in the application can allow attackers to perform local file read (LFR) or **path traversal attacks**. These vulnerabilities occur when user input is used to construct file paths without adequate sanitization or validation. For example, using file../../../etc/passwd or file ///etc/passwd can bypass weak validations and allow unauthorized access to sensitive files. Even though this has been addressed in previous patch, it is still insufficient. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.48.05.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-56509:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation when handling file paths. The application attempts to prevent access to local files using a regular expression check `if re.search(r'^file:/', url.strip(), re.IGNORECASE):` but this check can be bypassed.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue. Attackers can manipulate the file path input to access files outside of the intended directory.\n*   **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate file paths, allowing attackers to use characters like `..` and spaces within the file URI to bypass the checks.\n*   **Insufficient Regex:** The initial regular expression used to prevent file access is too simplistic and does not account for variations in file path formats.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Local File Read (LFR):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read arbitrary local files on the server where the application is running. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive information, such as configuration files, user data, or system files like `/etc/passwd`.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **URL Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the URL provided to the application. Attackers can craft URLs with `file:` protocol and path traversal sequences.\n*   **Direct Input:** Attackers provide the malicious file path directly, for example, when setting up a new watch.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application's interface to input the manipulated URLs.\n*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability doesn't require any specific privileges or user interaction, making it easier to exploit for any user with access to the application.\n*   **Knowledge of Target File System:** A successful attack requires some knowledge of the server's file system structure to craft valid path traversal sequences.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is present in the `changedetection.io` application.\n*   The problematic code is in `changedetectionio/processors/__init__.py`, specifically where the URL is checked for the `file:/` protocol.\n*   The vulnerability is demonstrated through proof-of-concept (PoC) that involves setting up a new watch with a malicious file path like `file:../../../../etc/passwd`.\n*   The fix involves a stricter file protocol checking which is implemented in the commit `f7e9846` (https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/commit/f7e9846c9b40a229813d19cdb66bf60fbe5e6a2a) which implements the fix for CVE-2024-56509. The commit message indicates that a \"Stricter file protocol checking pre-check\" was added.\n*   The vulnerability is addressed in versions 0.48.05 and later.\n*   The original flawed regex is `r'^file:/'` which is updated to check for variations such as `file:../../../../etc/passwd` and `file: ///etc/passwd`.\n\nThe content provides more specific details than the official CVE description, including the vulnerable code snippet, attack vectors, and PoC steps.",

Thus, while **Improper Input Validation** is present, the root cause is the **Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**. CWE-22 is a base level CWE and therefore preferred over the class level CWE-20.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe22 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Input Validation** (CWE-20), which leads to **Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** (CWE-22). This allows attackers to bypass validations and gain unauthorized access to sensitive files, leading to Local File Read (LFR).\n  - The root cause is **Improper Input Validation**\n  - The weakness is **Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**\n  - The impact is unauthorized access to sensitive files, leading to Local File Read (LFR)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified that the vulnerability stems from **Improper Input Validation**. However, after further analysis, it was determined that the root cause is more specifically related to **Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**. The vulnerability description clearly states that the application uses user input to construct file paths without adequate sanitization or validation, leading to path traversal attacks. The evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, noting that the application fails to properly sanitize or validate file paths, allowing attackers to use characters like `..` to bypass checks.\n\nThe decision to prioritize CWE-22 over CWE-20 is based on the principle of selecting the most specific CWE that accurately represents the vulnerability. While **Improper Input Validation** is a contributing factor, the core issue is the lack of proper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory, which is precisely what CWE-22 addresses.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the vulnerability's root cause and aligns with the provided evidence and mapping guidance.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
