The vulnerability description clearly states that the **manipulation of the request argument** leads to **information disclosure**. This points directly to CWE-200, Information Exposure.\n\nThe retriever results suggested other CWEs like CWE-425 (Direct Request), CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting), and CWE-89 (SQL Injection). However, these CWEs don't directly align with the described vulnerability. The provided CVE Reference Links Content Summary was unrelated, which reduced the confidence level.\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 is based on the direct evidence of **information disclosure** due to **manipulation of the request argument**. The other CWEs were considered but deemed less relevant based on the available information. The specificity of CWE-200 aligns well with the described impact, making it the optimal choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
