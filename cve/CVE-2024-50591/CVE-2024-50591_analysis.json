  "description": "An attacker with local access the to medical office computer can escalate his Windows user privileges to NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM by exploiting a **command injection** vulnerability in the Elefant Update Service. The **command injection** can be exploited by communicating with the Elefant Update Service which is running as SYSTEM via Windows Named Pipes.The Elefant Software Updater (ESU) consists of two components. An ESU service which runs as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM and an ESU tray client which communicates with the service to update or repair the installation and is running with user permissions. The communication is implemented using named pipes. A crafted message of type MessageType.SupportServiceInfos can be sent to the local ESU service to inject commands, which are then executed as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-50591:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw within the Elefant Software Updater (ESU) service. This service runs with \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\" privileges.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Command Injection:** The ESU service improperly handles input sent via named pipes, specifically in the `CollectServiceInfos` function related to \"MessageType.SupportServiceInfos\". User-provided input is directly used in a command execution without sufficient sanitization or filtering.\n- **Named Pipe Communication:** The communication between the ESU tray client (user-level) and the ESU service (SYSTEM-level) occurs through named pipes, which allows for the injection of malicious data.\n- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** Input provided to the `CollectServiceInfos` function is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.\n- **Unfiltered Path Creation:** Before the command injection sink, a directory is created from a portion of the input. While specific characters are restricted due to Windows limitations, the '&' character remains usable for command chaining.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\nSuccessful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate their privileges from a regular user to \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.\" This enables the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on the system, such as installing software, modifying system configurations, accessing sensitive data, and potentially compromising the entire system.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the medical office computer where the Elefant software and ESU are installed.\n- **Named Pipe Communication:** The attack involves sending a crafted message via named pipes to the ESU service.\n- **Command Injection:** The attacker injects a malicious command into the `CollectServiceInfos` function parameter, which is then executed by the ESU service.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Local Access:**  The attacker must have a local user account on the target machine.\n- **Knowledge of Named Pipe Communication:** The attacker must be able to communicate with the ESU service via named pipes and know how to craft a message to trigger the command injection.\n- **Command Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs to craft a working command-injection payload that bypasses basic Windows path restrictions.\n- **Payload Delivery:** The attacker needs to deliver the attack payload via the client, using the service to execute commands.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- The vulnerability is in the `CollectServiceInfos` function of the Elefant Software Updater Service.\n- The input is split by ';' but does not properly filter characters that can be used for command injection like '&'.\n- The attacker injects commands that are executed as \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\".\n- The proof of concept demonstrated the ability to execute a PowerShell script as \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\" by injecting a payload via a modified \"Info\" function in the ESU tray client.\n- The injection occurs before the path is created, and the injected command will be executed once the directory creation is successful.\n- The provided proof of concept uses a PowerShell command to write the username to a file on the system.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- This vulnerability is part of a set of multiple vulnerabilities found in HASOMED Elefant and Elefant Software Updater.\n- The identified vulnerabilities include unprotected database access, an unprotected FHIR API, and other local privilege escalation flaws.\n- The vendor has released patches to address these vulnerabilities.",
