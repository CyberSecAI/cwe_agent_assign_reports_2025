  "query": "A vulnerability Veeam Backup & Replication allows low-privileged users to control and modify configurations on connected virtual infrastructure hosts. This includes the ability to power off virtual machines, delete files in storage, and make configuration changes, potentially leading to Denial of Service (DoS) and data integrity issues. The vulnerability is caused by improper permission checks in methods accessed via management services.",
