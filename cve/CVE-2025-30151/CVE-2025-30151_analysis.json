While more specific children of CWE-400 might exist, the description doesn't provide enough detail to pinpoint a more precise weakness. CWE-1333 was considered because the long passwords may be processed using regular expressions, leading to inefficiency and resource exhaustion.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')\"]\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe1333 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **passing long passwords** (input) which leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption** and results in **Denial of Service (DoS)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-400 as the primary weakness due to the direct mention of Denial of Service, which is a common impact of uncontrolled resource consumption. The **root cause** is the **acceptance of excessively long passwords**, leading to resource exhaustion.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description, specifically the phrases \"**passing long passwords** that leads to Denial Of Service\" and \"Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability,\" strongly supports this classification. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further validates this by stating, \"Passing long passwords to forms in Storefront or Store-API\" as the root cause and \"Denial of Service\" as the impact.\n\nCWE-1333 was considered as a secondary factor because it is possible the passwords were being processed using an inefficient regular expression.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because the description focuses on the high-level impact of resource consumption without providing specific details about the underlying cause beyond the **passing of long passwords**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected:* This is not related to the vulnerability description.
