# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-23501

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | 1.0 | Compound | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 0.8 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-352 [CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)], a compound weakness describing the lack of verification of request origin. The vulnerability description also mentions Stored XSS as an impact, which is best represented by CWE-79 [CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]. The relationship between CSRF and XSS is not directly defined in the CWE database, but it's common for successful CSRF attacks to lead to other vulnerabilities like XSS. The abstraction levels are appropriate, with CWE-352 [CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] being a compound weakness and CWE-79 [CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] being a base weakness.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper CSRF protection** (CWE-352 [CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]). An attacker exploits this by forging requests on behalf of a user, potentially leading to Stored XSS (CWE-79 [CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]). The lack of CSRF protection allows the attacker to inject malicious scripts, which are then stored and executed by other users.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the supporting information from the CVE reference. The description clearly states a **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability** due to **improper CSRF protection**. This directly maps to CWE-352 [CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]. The impact of the CSRF vulnerability is Stored XSS, which maps to CWE-79 [CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')].
The retriever results also support the selection of CWE-352 [CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] as the primary CWE, with the highest similarity score. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-352 [CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] is the root cause, and CWE-79 [CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] is a potential impact.
The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-352 [CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] being a compound weakness that accurately represents the lack of CSRF protection, and CWE-79 [CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] being a base weakness representing the XSS vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

## CWE-784: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of a cookie, but it does not properly ensure that the cookie is valid for the associated user.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This was not selected as it describes a specific mechanism involving cookies, whereas the vulnerability description only mentions CSRF.*

## CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a cookie to store sensitive information, but the cookie is not marked with the HttpOnly flag.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This was not selected as it describes a specific issue with the HttpOnly flag on cookies, and the vulnerability is a more general CSRF issue.*

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This was not selected as it describes a more general authorization issue, not specifically CSRF.*

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*This was not selected as it relates to output encoding, and the primary issue is the lack of CSRF protection.*

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This was not selected as it relates to immutable parameter verification and does not directly address the CSRF issue.*

## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This was not selected as it describes Server-Side Request Forgery, a different type of vulnerability.*

## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This was selected as a secondary CWE due to Stored XSS.*

## CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.
