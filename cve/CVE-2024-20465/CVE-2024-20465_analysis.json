  "description": "A vulnerability in the access control list (ACL) programming of Cisco IOS Software running on Cisco Industrial Ethernet 4000, 4010, and 5000 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured ACL. This vulnerability is due to the **incorrect handling of IPv4 ACLs on switched virtual interfaces** when an administrator enables and disables Resilient Ethernet Protocol (REP). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass an ACL on the affected device.",

IPv4 ACLs configured on an SVI are not correctly evaluated after enabling and disabling REP on an uplink interface.\n- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass configured ACLs, potentially gaining unauthorized access or control over network resources, though the specific impact is limited to the bypass itself.\n- **Attack vectors**: Sending network traffic through an affected device with a misconfigured ACL after REP was enabled/disabled.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send traffic to the affected device remotely. They do not need authentication.",

The **incorrect handling of IPv4 ACLs on switched virtual interfaces** leads to the ability to bypass the intended access control, which is an authorization issue. |\n| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.7 | Pillar | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate. This is a high-level category that could be applicable, but CWE-863 is more specific.|\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), which is a Class-level CWE. CWE-863 is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), which is a Pillar-level CWE. CWE-863 is more specific and directly addresses the **incorrect authorization** mechanism, making it a better choice than the more general CWE-284.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect handling of IPv4 ACLs on switched virtual interfaces** (the root cause), which results in an ACL bypass, allowing an unauthenticated, remote attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access to network resources.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Incorrect handling of IPv4 ACLs on switched virtual interfaces**\n  - **Weakness:** ACL bypass\n  - **Impact:** Potential unauthorized access to network resources\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary, which clearly indicate an **incorrect handling of IPv4 ACLs** leading to an ACL bypass. The **incorrect handling** directly implies a flaw in the authorization mechanism rather than a complete lack of authorization or authentication.\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a more specific child of the broader CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), making it the more appropriate choice. The provided evidence supports mapping the root cause to CWE-863 because the ACLs are present and configured but are not functioning as intended due to the **incorrect handling**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-863 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately captures the nature of the vulnerability\u2014an authorization mechanism that is implemented incorrectly.\nThe retriever results also list CWE-863 as a candidate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
