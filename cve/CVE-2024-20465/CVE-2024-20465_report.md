# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-20465

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-20465

## Description

A vulnerability in the access control list (ACL) programming of Cisco IOS Software running on Cisco Industrial Ethernet 4000, 4010, and 5000 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured ACL. This vulnerability is due to the **incorrect handling of IPv4 ACLs on switched virtual interfaces** when an administrator enables and disables Resilient Ethernet Protocol (REP). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass an ACL on the affected device.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** incorrect handling of IPv4 ACLs on switched virtual interfaces
- **Impact:** bypass ACL
- **Attacker:** unauthenticated remote attacker
- **Product:** Cisco Industrial Ethernet 4000, 4010, and 5000 Series Switches
- **Component:** access control list (ACL) programming

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE. The **incorrect handling of IPv4 ACLs on switched virtual interfaces** leads to the ability to bypass the intended access control, which is an authorization issue. |
| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.7 | Pillar | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate. This is a high-level category that could be applicable, but CWE-863 is more specific.|

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), which is a Class-level CWE. CWE-863 is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), which is a Pillar-level CWE. CWE-863 is more specific and directly addresses the **incorrect authorization** mechanism, making it a better choice than the more general CWE-284.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect handling of IPv4 ACLs on switched virtual interfaces** (the root cause), which results in an ACL bypass, allowing an unauthenticated, remote attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access to network resources.
  - **Root Cause:** **Incorrect handling of IPv4 ACLs on switched virtual interfaces**
  - **Weakness:** ACL bypass
  - **Impact:** Potential unauthorized access to network resources

## Summary of Analysis
The primary assessment is based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary, which clearly indicate an **incorrect handling of IPv4 ACLs** leading to an ACL bypass. The **incorrect handling** directly implies a flaw in the authorization mechanism rather than a complete lack of authorization or authentication.

The graph relationships confirm that CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a more specific child of the broader CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), making it the more appropriate choice. The provided evidence supports mapping the root cause to CWE-863 because the ACLs are present and configured but are not functioning as intended due to the **incorrect handling**.

The selection of CWE-863 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately captures the nature of the vulnerabilityâ€”an authorization mechanism that is implemented incorrectly.
The retriever results also list CWE-863 as a candidate.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs multiple related behaviors, but the behaviors are performed in the wrong order in ways which may produce resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.



## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
