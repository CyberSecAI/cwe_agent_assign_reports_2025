It is caused by **CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)**, a **Class** level CWE. CWE-787 is a child of **CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer)**. The relationship shows that improper input validation can lead to an out-of-bounds write, which results in memory corruption.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)**, which allows malicious input to reach the `libmediaextractorservice.so` library. This leads to **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)**, causing memory corruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. The vulnerability's root cause is **improper input validation**, which leads to **memory corruption** due to an out-of-bounds write. The retriever results support this classification, with CWE-787 and CWE-20 being among the top candidates.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 as the primary CWE is based on the fact that the vulnerability ultimately leads to an out-of-bounds write, which causes memory corruption. CWE-20 is selected as a secondary CWE because it represents the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input or data, but it does\n        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the\n        properties that are required to process the data safely and\n        correctly.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287].
