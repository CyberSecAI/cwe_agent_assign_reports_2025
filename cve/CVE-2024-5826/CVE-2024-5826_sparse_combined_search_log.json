  "query": "In the latest version of vanna-ai/vanna, the `vanna.ask` function is vulnerable to remote code execution due to prompt injection. The root cause is the lack of a sandbox when executing LLM-generated code, allowing an attacker to manipulate the code executed by the `exec` function in `src/vanna/base/base.py`. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to achieve remote code execution on the app backend server, potentially gaining full control of the server.",
