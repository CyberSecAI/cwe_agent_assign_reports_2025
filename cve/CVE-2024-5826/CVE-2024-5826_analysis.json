The root cause is the **lack of a sandbox when executing LLM-generated code**, allowing an attacker to manipulate the code executed by the `exec` function in `src/vanna/base/base.py`.

CWE-1427 is related because the input is used for LLM prompting, but the lack of proper control over the generated code is the more direct cause. CWE-94 is a parent of several more specific injection CWEs, but none of them fit perfectly.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe1427[\"CWE-1427: Improper Neutralization of Input Used for LLM Prompting\"]\n    \n    cwe1427 -->|INPUT| cwe94\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe1427 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **prompt injection** due to the **lack of a sandbox when executing LLM-generated code**. This leads to the `exec` function executing manipulated code, resulting in remote code execution.\n  - **Root Cause**: **Lack of a sandbox** leading to **improper control of code generation** (CWE-94).\n  - **Weakness**: **Prompt Injection** leveraged to influence code (CWE-1427).\n  - **Impact**: Remote Code Execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary issue is the ability to inject arbitrary code due to the **lack of a sandbox** when executing LLM-generated code. This is best captured by CWE-94. The **prompt injection** aspect is a contributing factor (CWE-1427), but the root cause lies in the unsafe execution environment.\n\nThe vulnerability description states \"the `vanna.ask` function is vulnerable to remote code execution due to **prompt injection**. The root cause is the **lack of a sandbox when executing LLM-generated code**, allowing an attacker to manipulate the code executed by the `exec` function\".\n\nCWE-94 is at the appropriate level of specificity as it directly addresses the improper control of code generation.

        "extended_description": "\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.",
