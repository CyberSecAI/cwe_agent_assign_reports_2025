          "matched_text": "CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\n\nType: Variant\n\nStatus: Draft\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nA hard-coded password typically leads to a significant authentication failure that can be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:\n\n```\n\t\tInbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.\n\t\tOutbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.\n```\nIn the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\n\nThe Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-29964: Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access\n\n- CVE-2021-37555: Telnet service for IoT feeder for dogs and cats has hard-coded password [REF-1288]\n\n- CVE-2021-35033: Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-27438: The software contains a hard-coded password it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components on the Reason DR60 (all firmware versions prior to 02A04.1).\n\n- CVE-2021-34757: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Business 220 Series Smart Switches firmware could allow an attacker with Administrator privileges to access sensitive login credentials or reconfigure the passwords on the user account.

It mishandles software updates such that local third-party apps can provide a spoofed software update file that contains an arbitrary shell script and arbitrary ARM binary, where both will be executed as the root user with an SELinux domain named osi. To exploit this vulnerability, a local third-party app needs to have write access to external storage to write the spoofed update at the expected path. The vulnerable system binary (i.e., /system/bin/osi_bin) does not perform any authentication of the update file beyond ensuring that it is encrypted with an AES key (that is hard-coded in the vulnerable system binary). Processes executing with the osi SELinux domain can programmatically perform the following actions: install apps, grant runtime permissions to apps (including permissions with protection levels of dangerous and development), access extensive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) using the programmatically grant permissions, uninstall apps, set the default launcher app to a malicious launcher app that spoofs other apps, set a network proxy to intercept network traffic, unload kernel modules, set the default keyboard to a keyboard that has keylogging functionality, examine notification contents, send text messages, and more. The spoofed update can optionally contain an arbitrary ARM binary that will be locally stored in internal storage and executed at system startup to achieve persistent code execution as the root user with the osi SELinux domain. This ARM binary will continue to execute at startup even if the app that provided the spoofed update is uninstalled.\n\n- CVE-2020-7352: The GalaxyClientService component of GOG Galaxy runs with elevated SYSTEM privileges in a Windows environment.

          "matched_text": "CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n\nType: Base\n\nStatus: Incomplete\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nMany password storage mechanisms compute a hash and store the hash, instead of storing the original password in plaintext. In this design, authentication involves accepting an incoming password, computing its hash, and comparing it to the stored hash.\n\n\nMany hash algorithms are designed to execute quickly with minimal overhead, even cryptographic hashes. However, this efficiency is a problem for password storage, because it can reduce an attacker's workload for brute-force password cracking. If an attacker can obtain the hashes through some other method (such as SQL injection on a database that stores hashes), then the attacker can store the hashes offline and use various techniques to crack the passwords by computing hashes efficiently. Without a built-in workload, modern attacks can compute large numbers of hashes, or even exhaust the entire space of all possible passwords, within a very short amount of time, using massively-parallel computing (such as cloud computing) and GPU, ASIC, or FPGA hardware. In such a scenario, an efficient hash algorithm helps the attacker.\n\n\nThere are several properties of a hash scheme that are relevant to its strength against an offline, massively-parallel attack:\n\n\n  - The amount of CPU time required to compute the hash (\"stretching\")\n\n  - The amount of memory required to compute the hash (\"memory-hard\" operations)\n\n  - Including a random value, along with the password, as input to the hash computation (\"salting\")\n\n  - Given a hash, there is no known way of determining an input (e.g., a password) that produces this hash value, other than by guessing possible inputs (\"one-way\" hashing)\n\n  - Relative to the number of all possible hashes that can be generated by the scheme, there is a low likelihood of producing the same hash for multiple different inputs (\"collision resistance\")\n\nNote that the security requirements for the product may vary depending on the environment and the value of the passwords. Different schemes might not provide all of these properties, yet may still provide sufficient security for the environment. Conversely, a solution might be very strong in preserving one property, which still being very weak for an attack against another property, or it might not be able to significantly reduce the efficiency of a massively-parallel attack.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2008-1526: Router does not use a salt with a hash, making it easier to crack passwords.\n\n- CVE-2006-1058: Router does not use a salt with a hash, making it easier to crack passwords.\n\n- CVE-2008-4905: Blogging software uses a hard-coded salt when calculating a password hash.\n\n- CVE-2002-1657: Database server uses the username for a salt when encrypting passwords, simplifying brute force attacks.\n\n- CVE-2001-0967: Server uses a constant salt when encrypting passwords, simplifying brute force attacks.\n\n- CVE-2005-0408: chain: product generates predictable MD5 hashes using a constant value combined with username, allowing authentication bypass.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-25754: An issue was discovered on Enphase Envoy R3.x and D4.x devices. There is a custom PAM module for user authentication that circumvents traditional user authentication. This module uses a password derived from the MD5 hash of the username and serial number. The serial number can be retrieved by an unauthenticated user at /info.xml. Attempts to change the user password via passwd or other tools have no effect.\n\n- CVE-2021-22741: Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort vulnerability exists in ClearSCADA (all versions), EcoStruxure Geo SCADA Expert 2019 (all versions), and EcoStruxure Geo SCADA Expert 2020 (V83.7742.1 and prior), which could cause the revealing of account credentials when server database files are available. Exposure of these files to an attacker can make the system vulnerable to password decryption attacks. Note that \u201c.sde\u201d configuration export files do not contain user account password hashes.\n\n- CVE-2021-32519: Use of password hash with insufficient computational effort vulnerability in QSAN Storage Manager, XEVO, SANOS allows remote attackers to recover the plain-text password by brute-forcing the MD5 hash. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.2, QSAN XEVO v2.1.0, and QSAN SANOS v2.1.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-33003: Delta Electronics DIAEnergie Version 1.7.5 and prior may allow an attacker to retrieve passwords in cleartext due to a weak hashing algorithm.\n\n- CVE-2021-37551: In JetBrains YouTrack before 2021.2.16363, system user passwords were hashed with SHA-256.\n\n- CVE-2021-38400: An attacker with physical access to Boston Scientific Zoom Latitude Model 3120 can remove the hard disk drive or create a specially crafted USB to extract the password hash for brute force reverse engineering of the system password.\n\n- CVE-2020-14516: In Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk Services Platform Versions 6.10.00 and 6.11.00, there is an issue with the implementation of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm with FactoryTalk Services Platform that prevents the user password from being hashed properly.\n\n- CVE-2021-36767: In Digi RealPort through 4.10.490, authentication relies on a challenge-response mechanism that gives access to the server password, making the protection ineffective. An attacker may send an unauthenticated request to the server. The server will reply with a weakly-hashed version of the server's access password. The attacker may then crack this hash offline in order to successfully login to the server.\n\n- CVE-2021-32997: The affected Baker Hughes Bentley Nevada products (3500 System 1 6.x, Part No. 3060/00 versions 6.98 and prior, 3500 System 1, Part No. 3071/xx & 3072/xx versions 21.1 HF1 and prior, 3500 Rack Configuration, Part No. 129133-01 versions 6.4 and prior, and 3500/22M Firmware, Part No. 288055-01 versions 5.05 and prior) utilize a weak encryption algorithm for storage and transmission of sensitive data, which may allow an attacker to more easily obtain credentials used for access.\n\n- CVE-2022-0022: Usage of a weak cryptographic algorithm in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software where the password hashes of administrator and local user accounts are not created with a sufficient level of computational effort, which allows for password cracking attacks on accounts in normal (non-FIPS-CC) operational mode. An attacker must have access to the account password hashes to take advantage of this weakness and can acquire those hashes if they are able to gain access to the PAN-OS software configuration. Fixed versions of PAN-OS software use a secure cryptographic algorithm for account password hashes. This issue does not impact Prisma Access firewalls. This issue impacts: PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.21; All versions of PAN-OS 9.0; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.11; PAN-OS 10.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.0.7.\n\n- CVE-2022-23348: BigAnt Software BigAnt Server v5.6.06 was discovered to utilize weak password hashes.\n\n- CVE-2022-26115: A use of password hash with insufficient computational effort vulnerability [CWE-916] in FortiSandbox before 4.2.0 may allow an attacker with access to the password database to efficiently mount bulk guessing attacks to recover the passwords.\n\n- CVE-2022-40258: AMI Megarac Weak password hashes for Redfish & API \n\n- CVE-2022-24041: A vulnerability has been identified in Desigo DXR2 (All versions < V01.21.142.5-22), Desigo PXC3 (All versions < V01.21.142.4-18), Desigo PXC4 (All versions < V02.20.142.10-10884), Desigo PXC5 (All versions < V02.20.142.10-10884). The web application stores the PBKDF2 derived key of users passwords with a low iteration count. An attacker with user profile access privilege can retrieve the stored password hashes of other accounts and then successfully perform an offline cracking attack and recover the plaintext passwords of other users.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-328 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-327 (ChildOf)",

Restricting frontend login to specific users, organized in different storage folders (partitions), can be bypassed. A potential attacker might use this ambiguity in usernames to get access to a different account - however, credentials must be known to the adversary. This issue is patched in versions 8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23600: fleet is an open source device management, built on osquery. Versions prior to 4.9.1 expose a limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with missing audience verification. This impacts deployments using SAML SSO in two specific cases: 1. A malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) could reuse the SAML response to log into Fleet as a user -- only if the user has an account with the same email in Fleet, _and_ the user signs into the malicious SP via SAML SSO from the same Identity Provider (IdP) configured with Fleet. 2. A user with an account in Fleet could reuse a SAML response intended for another SP to log into Fleet. This is only a concern if the user is blocked from Fleet in the IdP, but continues to have an account in Fleet. If the user is blocked from the IdP entirely, this cannot be exploited. Fleet 4.9.1 resolves this issue. Users unable to upgrade should: Reduce the length of sessions on your IdP to reduce the window for malicious re-use, Limit the amount of SAML Service Providers/Applications used by user accounts with access to Fleet, and When removing access to Fleet in the IdP, delete the Fleet user from Fleet as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24259: An incorrect check in the component cdr.php of Voipmonitor GUI before v24.96 allows unauthenticated attackers to escalate privileges via a crafted request.\n\n- CVE-2022-24883: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

In versions prior to 2.4.3, when using Portable Authentication Modules (PAM) for user authentication, if a user presented valid credentials but the account is disabled or otherwise not allowed to access the host (such as an expired password), it would still be accepted for access to Arvados. Other authentication methods (LDAP, OpenID Connect) supported by Arvados are not affected by this flaw. This issue is patched in version 2.4.3. Workaround for this issue is to migrate to a different authentication method supported by Arvados, such as LDAP.\n\n- CVE-2022-39263: `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding.\n\n- CVE-2022-39355: Discourse Patreon enables syncronization between Discourse Groups and Patreon rewards.

Versions prior to 2.7.13 in `stable`, 2.8.0.beta11 in `beta`, and 2.8.0.beta11 in `tests-passed` allow some users to log in to a community before they should be able to do so. A user invited via email to a forum with `must_approve_users` enabled is going to be automatically logged in, bypassing the check that does not allow unapproved users to sign in. They will be able to do everything an approved user can do. If they logout, they cannot log back in. This issue is patched in the `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11. One may disable invites as a workaround. Administrators can increase `min_trust_level_to_allow_invite` to reduce the attack surface to more trusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-2303: An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1.

This allows an attacker to use one AK, EK pair from a real TPM to pass EK validation and give the verifier an AK of a software TPM. A successful attack breaks the entire chain of trust because a not validated AK is used by the verifier. This issue is worse if the validation happens first and then the agent gets added to the verifier because the timing is easier and the verifier does not validate the regcount entry being equal to 1,\n\n- CVE-2022-45124: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the User authentication functionality of WellinTech KingHistorian 35.01.00.05. A specially crafted network packet can lead to a disclosure of sensitive information.

          "matched_text": "CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n\nType: Class\n\nStatus: Incomplete\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nBy design, authentication protocols try to ensure that attackers must perform brute force attacks if they do not know the credentials such as a key or password. However, when these credentials are easily predictable or even fixed (as with default or hard-coded passwords and keys), then the attacker can defeat the mechanism without relying on brute force.\n\n\nCredentials may be weak for different reasons, such as:\n\n\n  - Hard-coded (i.e., static and unchangeable by the administrator)\n\n  - Default (i.e., the same static value across different deployments/installations, but able to be changed by the administrator)\n\n  - Predictable (i.e., generated in a way that produces unique credentials across deployments/installations, but can still be guessed with reasonable efficiency)\n\nEven if a new, unique credential is intended to be generated for each product installation, if the generation is predictable, then that may also simplify guessing attacks.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- [REF-1374]: Chain: JavaScript-based cryptocurrency library can fall back to the insecure Math.random() function instead of reporting a failure (CWE-392), thus reducing the entropy (CWE-332) and leading to generation of non-unique cryptographic keys for Bitcoin wallets (CWE-1391)\n\n- CVE-2022-30270: Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses default credentials for some SSH accounts\n\n- CVE-2022-29965: Distributed Control System (DCS) uses a deterministic algorithm to generate utility passwords\n\n- CVE-2022-30271: Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used in typical deployments\n\n- CVE-2021-38759: microcontroller board has default password, allowing admin access\n\n- CVE-2021-41192: data visualization/sharing package uses default secret keys or cookie values if they are not specified in environment variables\n\n- CVE-2020-8994: UART interface for AI speaker uses empty password for root shell\n\n- CVE-2020-27020: password manager does not generate cryptographically strong passwords, allowing prediction of passwords using guessable details such as time of generation\n\n- CVE-2020-8632: password generator for cloud application has small length value, making it easier for brute-force guessing\n\n- CVE-2020-5365: network-attached storage (NAS) system has predictable default passwords for a diagnostics/support account\n\n- CVE-2020-5248: IT asset management app has a default encryption key that is the same across installations\n\n- CVE-2018-3825: cloud cluster management product has a default master encryption key\n\n- CVE-2012-3503: Installation script has a hard-coded secret token value, allowing attackers to bypass authentication\n\n- CVE-2010-2306: Intrusion Detection System (IDS) uses the same static, private SSL keys for multiple devices and installations, allowing decryption of SSL traffic\n\n- CVE-2001-0618: Residential gateway uses the last 5 digits of the 'Network Name' or SSID as the default WEP key, which allows attackers to get the key by sniffing the SSID, which is sent in the clear\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-3875: A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Click Studios Passwordstate and Passwordstate Browser Extension Chrome. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the component API. The manipulation leads to authentication bypass by assumed-immutable data. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-216244.\n\n- CVE-2021-3979: A key length flaw was found in Red Hat Ceph Storage. An attacker can exploit the fact that the key length is incorrectly passed in an encryption algorithm to create a non random key, which is weaker and can be exploited for loss of confidentiality and integrity on encrypted disks.\n\n- CVE-2021-42949: The component controlla_login function in HotelDruid Hotel Management Software v3.0.3 generates a predictable session token, allowing attackers to bypass authentication via bruteforce attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-23555: authentik is an open-source Identity Provider focused on flexibility and versatility. Versions prior to 2022.11.4 and 2022.10.4 are vulnerable to Improper Authentication. Token reuse in invitation URLs leads to access control bypass via the use of a different enrollment flow than in the one provided. The vulnerability allows an attacker that knows different invitation flows names (e.g. `enrollment-invitation-test` and `enrollment-invitation-admin`) via either different invite links or via brute forcing to signup via a single invitation url for any valid invite link received (it can even be a url for a third flow as long as it's a valid invite) as the token used in the `Invitations` section of the Admin interface does NOT change when a different `enrollment flow` is selected via the interface and it is NOT bound to the selected flow, so it will be valid for any flow when used. This issue is patched in authentik 2022.11.4,2022.10.4 and 2022.12.0. Only configurations that use invitations and have multiple enrollment flows with invitation stages that grant different permissions are affected. The default configuration is not vulnerable, and neither are configurations with a single enrollment flow. As a workaround, fixed data can be added to invitations which can be checked in the flow to deny requests. Alternatively, an identifier with high entropy (like a UUID) can be used as flow slug, mitigating the attack vector by exponentially decreasing the possibility of discovering other flows.\n\n- CVE-2022-28376: Verizon 5G Home LVSKIHP outside devices through 2022-02-15 allow anyone (knowing the device's serial number) to access a CPE admin website, e.g., at the 10.0.0.1 IP address. The password (for the verizon username) is calculated by concatenating the serial number and the model (i.e., the LVSKIHP string), running the sha256sum program, and extracting the first seven characters concatenated with the last seven characters of that SHA-256 value.\n\n- CVE-2022-34919: The file upload wizard in Zengenti Contensis Classic before 15.2.1.79 does not correctly check that a user has authenticated. By uploading a crafted aspx file, it is possible to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n- CVE-2022-40494: NPS before v0.26.10 was discovered to contain an authentication bypass vulnerability via constantly generating and sending the Auth key and Timestamp parameters.\n\n- CVE-2021-41506: Xiaongmai AHB7008T-MH-V2, AHB7804R-ELS, AHB7804R-MH-V2, AHB7808R-MS-V2, AHB7808R-MS, AHB7808T-MS-V2, AHB7804R-LMS, HI3518_50H10L_S39 V4.02.R11.7601.Nat.Onvif.20170420, V4.02.R11.Nat.Onvif.20160422, V4.02.R11.7601.Nat.Onvif.20170424, V4.02.R11.Nat.Onvif.20170327, V4.02.R11.Nat.Onvif.20161205, V4.02.R11.Nat.20170301, V4.02.R12.Nat.OnvifS.20170727 is affected by a backdoor in the macGuarder and dvrHelper binaries of DVR/NVR/IP camera firmware due to static root account credentials in the system.\n\n- CVE-2022-43917:  IBM WebSphere Application Server 8.5 and 9.0 traditional container uses weaker than expected cryptographic keys that could allow an attacker to decrypt sensitive information. This affects only the containerized version of WebSphere Application Server traditional. IBM X-Force ID: 241045. \n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-1390 (ChildOf)",

Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-10987: OS command injection in Wi-Fi router, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-10221: Template functionality in network configuration management tool allows OS command injection, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-9054: Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in username parameter, leading to OS command injection (CWE-78), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-1999-0067: Canonical example of OS command injection.

An issue in versions 1.4.0 to 1.5.1 allows for exposure of the home directory on Unix systems when using Bash with the `escape` or `escapeAll` functions from the _shescape_ API with the `interpolation` option set to `true`. Other tested shells, Dash and Zsh, are not affected. Depending on how the output of _shescape_ is used, directory traversal may be possible in the application using _shescape_. The issue was patched in version 1.5.1. As a workaround, manually escape all instances of the tilde character (`~`) using `arg.replace(/~/g, \"\\\\\\\\~\")`.\n\n- CVE-2022-33891: The Apache Spark UI offers the possibility to enable ACLs via the configuration option spark.acls.enable. With an authentication filter, this checks whether a user has access permissions to view or modify the application. If ACLs are enabled, a code path in HttpSecurityFilter can allow someone to perform impersonation by providing an arbitrary user name. A malicious user might then be able to reach a permission check function that will ultimately build a Unix shell command based on their input, and execute it. This will result in arbitrary shell command execution as the user Spark is currently running as. This affects Apache Spark versions 3.0.3 and earlier, versions 3.1.1 to 3.1.2, and versions 3.2.0 to 3.2.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-27561: Yealink Device Management (DM) 3.6.0.20 allows command injection as root via the /sm/api/v1/firewall/zone/services URI, without authentication.\n\n- CVE-2022-26258: D-Link DIR-820L 1.05B03 was discovered to contain remote command execution (RCE) vulnerability via HTTP POST to get set ccp.\n\n- CVE-2022-28810: Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus before build 6122 allows a remote authenticated administrator to execute arbitrary operating OS commands as SYSTEM via the policy custom script feature.

In affected versions a command injection vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on a server running Cacti, if a specific data source was selected for any monitored device. The vulnerability resides in the `remote_agent.php` file. This file can be accessed without authentication. This function retrieves the IP address of the client via `get_client_addr` and resolves this IP address to the corresponding hostname via `gethostbyaddr`. After this, it is verified that an entry within the `poller` table exists, where the hostname corresponds to the resolved hostname. If such an entry was found, the function returns `true` and the client is authorized. This authorization can be bypassed due to the implementation of the `get_client_addr` function. The function is defined in the file `lib/functions.php` and checks serval `$_SERVER` variables to determine the IP address of the client. The variables beginning with `HTTP_` can be arbitrarily set by an attacker. Since there is a default entry in the `poller` table with the hostname of the server running Cacti, an attacker can bypass the authentication e.g. by providing the header `Forwarded-For: <TARGETIP>`. This way the function `get_client_addr` returns the IP address of the server running Cacti. The following call to `gethostbyaddr` will resolve this IP address to the hostname of the server, which will pass the `poller` hostname check because of the default entry. After the authorization of the `remote_agent.php` file is bypassed, an attacker can trigger different actions. One of these actions is called `polldata`. The called function `poll_for_data` retrieves a few request parameters and loads the corresponding `poller_item` entries from the database. If the `action` of a `poller_item` equals `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP`, the function `proc_open` is used to execute a PHP script. The attacker-controlled parameter `$poller_id` is retrieved via the function `get_nfilter_request_var`, which allows arbitrary strings. This variable is later inserted into the string passed to `proc_open`, which leads to a command injection vulnerability. By e.g. providing the `poller_id=;id` the `id` command is executed. In order to reach the vulnerable call, the attacker must provide a `host_id` and `local_data_id`, where the `action` of the corresponding `poller_item` is set to `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP`. Both of these ids (`host_id` and `local_data_id`) can easily be bruteforced. The only requirement is that a `poller_item` with an `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP` action exists. This is very likely on a productive instance because this action is added by some predefined templates like `Device - Uptime` or `Device - Polling Time`. This command injection vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary commands if a `poller_item` with the `action` type `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP` (`2`) is configured. The authorization bypass should be prevented by not allowing an attacker to make `get_client_addr` (file `lib/functions.php`) return an arbitrary IP address. This could be done by not honoring the `HTTP_...` `$_SERVER` variables. If these should be kept for compatibility reasons it should at least be prevented to fake the IP address of the server running Cacti. This vulnerability has been addressed in both the 1.2.x and 1.3.x release branches with `1.2.23` being the first release containing the patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-42759: A violation of secure design principles in Fortinet Meru AP version 8.6.1 and below, version 8.5.5 and below allows attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands via crafted cli commands.\n\n- CVE-2021-43073: A improper neutralization of special elements used in an os command ('os command injection') in Fortinet FortiWeb version 6.4.1 and 6.4.0, version 6.3.15 and below, version 6.2.6 and below allows attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands via crafted HTTP requests.\n\n- CVE-2021-43075: A improper neutralization of special elements used in an os command ('os command injection') in Fortinet FortiWLM version 8.6.2 and below, version 8.5.2 and below, version 8.4.2 and below, version 8.3.2 and below allows attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands via crafted HTTP requests to the alarm dashboard and controller config handlers.\n\n- CVE-2021-43928: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command ('OS Command Injection') vulnerability in mail sending and receiving component in Synology Mail Station before 20211105-10315 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary commands via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2021-44171: A improper neutralization of special elements used in an os command ('os command injection') in Fortinet FortiOS version 6.0.0 through 6.0.14, FortiOS version 6.2.0 through 6.2.10, FortiOS version 6.4.0 through 6.4.8, FortiOS version 7.0.0 through 7.0.3 allows attacker to execute privileged commands on a linked FortiSwitch via diagnostic CLI commands.\n\n- CVE-2022-1703: Improper neutralization of special elements in the SonicWall SSL-VPN SMA100 series management interface allows a remote authenticated attacker to inject OS Commands which potentially leads to remote command execution vulnerability or denial of service (DoS) attack.\n\n- CVE-2022-22273: Improper neutralization of Special Elements leading to OS Command Injection vulnerability impacting end-of-life Secure Remote Access (SRA) products and older firmware versions of Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 series products, specifically the SRA appliances running all 8.x, 9.0.0.5-19sv and earlier versions and Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 series products running older firmware 9.0.0.9-26sv and earlier versions\n\n- CVE-2022-22301: An improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS Command vulnerability [CWE-78] in FortiAP-C console 5.4.0 through 5.4.3, 5.2.0 through 5.2.1 may allow an authenticated attacker to execute unauthorized commands by running CLI commands with specifically crafted arguments.\n\n- CVE-2022-22684: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command ('OS Command Injection') vulnerability in task management component in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.4-25553 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary commands via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2022-2185: A critical issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 14.0 prior to 14.10.5, 15.0 prior to 15.0.4, and 15.1 prior to 15.1.1 where an authenticated user authorized to import projects could import a maliciously crafted project leading to remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-4257: A vulnerability was found in C-DATA Web Management System.

This vulnerability may be triggered when running the the CLI tool directly, or when running a scan with one of the IDE plugins that invoke the Snyk CLI. Successful exploitation of this issue would likely require some level of social engineering - to coerce an untrusted project to be downloaded and analyzed via the Snyk CLI or opened in an IDE where a Snyk IDE plugin is installed and enabled. Additionally, if the IDE has a Trust feature then the target folder must be marked as \u2018trusted\u2019 in order to be vulnerable. **NOTE:** This issue is independent of the one reported in [CVE-2022-40764](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SNYK-3037342), and upgrading to a fixed version for this addresses that issue as well.

A successful exploit allows attackers to run arbitrary commands on the host system where the Snyk CLI is installed by passing in crafted command line flags. In order to exploit this vulnerability, a user would have to execute the snyk test command on untrusted files. In most cases, an attacker positioned to control the command line arguments to the Snyk CLI would already be positioned to execute arbitrary commands. However, this could be abused in specific scenarios, such as continuous integration pipelines, where developers can control the arguments passed to the Snyk CLI to leverage this component as part of a wider attack against an integration/build pipeline. This issue has been addressed in the latest Snyk Docker images available at https://hub.docker.com/r/snyk/snyk as of 2022-11-29. Images downloaded and built prior to that date should be updated.

Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:\n\n```\n\t\tInbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.\n\t\tOutbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.\n```\nIn the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\n\nThe Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\n",

In this variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. It can also be difficult for the administrator to detect.\n\n  - Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. This variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password that can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product.\n\n",

Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:\n\n```\n\t\tInbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.\n\t\tOutbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.\n```\nIn the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\n\nThe Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\n",

In this variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. It can also be difficult for the administrator to detect.\n\n  - Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. This variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password that can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product.\n\n",

            "matched_text": "CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\n\nType: Variant\n\nStatus: Draft\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nA hard-coded password typically leads to a significant authentication failure that can be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:\n\n```\n\t\tInbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.\n\t\tOutbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.\n```\nIn the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\n\nThe Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-29964: Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access\n\n- CVE-2021-37555: Telnet service for IoT feeder for dogs and cats has hard-coded password [REF-1288]\n\n- CVE-2021-35033: Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-27438: The software contains a hard-coded password it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components on the Reason DR60 (all firmware versions prior to 02A04.1).\n\n- CVE-2021-34757: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Business 220 Series Smart Switches firmware could allow an attacker with Administrator privileges to access sensitive login credentials or reconfigure the passwords on the user account. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2020-1716: A flaw was found in the ceph-ansible playbook where it contained hardcoded passwords that were being used as default passwords while deploying Ceph services.

NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer\n\n- CVE-2021-38456: A use of hard-coded password vulnerability in the Moxa MXview Network Management software Versions 3.x to 3.2.2 may allow an attacker to gain access through accounts using default passwords\n\n- CVE-2021-43575: KNX ETS6 through 6.0.0 uses the hard-coded password ETS5Password, with a salt value of Ivan Medvedev, allowing local users to read project information, a similar issue to CVE-2021-36799. NOTE: The vendor disputes this because it is not the responsibility of the ETS to securely store cryptographic key material when it is not being exported\n\n- CVE-2020-25752: An issue was discovered on Enphase Envoy R3.x and D4.x devices. There are hardcoded web-panel login passwords for the installer and Enphase accounts. The passwords for these accounts are hardcoded values derived from the MD5 hash of the username and serial number mixed with some static strings. The serial number can be retrieved by an unauthenticated user at /info.xml. These passwords can be easily calculated by an attacker; users are unable to change these passwords.\n\n- CVE-2020-29321: The D-Link router DIR-868L 3.01 is vulnerable to credentials disclosure in telnet service through decompilation of firmware, that allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to the firmware and to extract sensitive data.\n\n- CVE-2020-29322: The D-Link router DIR-880L 1.07 is vulnerable to credentials disclosure in telnet service through decompilation of firmware, that allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to the firmware and to extract sensitive data.\n\n- CVE-2020-29323: The D-link router DIR-885L-MFC 1.15b02, v1.21b05 is vulnerable to credentials disclosure in telnet service through decompilation of firmware, that allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to the firmware and to extract sensitive data.\n\n- CVE-2021-45520: Certain NETGEAR devices are affected by a hardcoded password.

In this variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. It can also be difficult for the administrator to detect.\n\n  - Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. This variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password that can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-29953: Condition Monitor firmware has a maintenance interface with hard-coded credentials\n\n- CVE-2022-29960: Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation\n\n- CVE-2022-29964: Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access\n\n- CVE-2022-30997: Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has a maintenance service that uses undocumented, hard-coded credentials\n\n- CVE-2022-30314: Firmware for a Safety Instrumented System (SIS) has hard-coded credentials for access to boot configuration\n\n- CVE-2022-30271: Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used in typical deployments\n\n- CVE-2021-37555: Telnet service for IoT feeder for dogs and cats has hard-coded password [REF-1288]\n\n- CVE-2021-35033: Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port\n\n- CVE-2012-3503: Installation script has a hard-coded secret token value, allowing attackers to bypass authentication\n\n- CVE-2010-2772: SCADA system uses a hard-coded password to protect back-end database containing authorization information, exploited by Stuxnet worm\n\n- CVE-2010-2073: FTP server library uses hard-coded usernames and passwords for three default accounts\n\n- CVE-2010-1573: Chain: Router firmware uses hard-coded username and password for access to debug functionality, which can be used to execute arbitrary code\n\n- CVE-2008-2369: Server uses hard-coded authentication key\n\n- CVE-2008-0961: Backup product uses hard-coded username and password, allowing attackers to bypass authentication via the RPC interface\n\n- CVE-2008-1160: Security appliance uses hard-coded password allowing attackers to gain root access\n\n- CVE-2006-7142: Drive encryption product stores hard-coded cryptographic keys for encrypted configuration files in executable programs\n\n- CVE-2005-3716: VoIP product uses hard-coded public credentials that cannot be changed, which allows attackers to obtain sensitive information\n\n- CVE-2005-3803: VoIP product uses hard coded public and private SNMP community strings that cannot be changed, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information\n\n- CVE-2005-0496: Backup product contains hard-coded credentials that effectively serve as a back door, which allows remote attackers to access the file system\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-25560: In SapphireIMS 5.0, it is possible to use the hardcoded credential in clients (username: sapphire, password: ims) and gain access to the portal.

It mishandles software updates such that local third-party apps can provide a spoofed software update file that contains an arbitrary shell script and arbitrary ARM binary, where both will be executed as the root user with an SELinux domain named osi. To exploit this vulnerability, a local third-party app needs to have write access to external storage to write the spoofed update at the expected path. The vulnerable system binary (i.e., /system/bin/osi_bin) does not perform any authentication of the update file beyond ensuring that it is encrypted with an AES key (that is hard-coded in the vulnerable system binary). Processes executing with the osi SELinux domain can programmatically perform the following actions: install apps, grant runtime permissions to apps (including permissions with protection levels of dangerous and development), access extensive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) using the programmatically grant permissions, uninstall apps, set the default launcher app to a malicious launcher app that spoofs other apps, set a network proxy to intercept network traffic, unload kernel modules, set the default keyboard to a keyboard that has keylogging functionality, examine notification contents, send text messages, and more. The spoofed update can optionally contain an arbitrary ARM binary that will be locally stored in internal storage and executed at system startup to achieve persistent code execution as the root user with the osi SELinux domain. This ARM binary will continue to execute at startup even if the app that provided the spoofed update is uninstalled.\n\n- CVE-2020-7352: The GalaxyClientService component of GOG Galaxy runs with elevated SYSTEM privileges in a Windows environment.

            "matched_text": "CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n\nType: Base\n\nStatus: Incomplete\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nMany password storage mechanisms compute a hash and store the hash, instead of storing the original password in plaintext. In this design, authentication involves accepting an incoming password, computing its hash, and comparing it to the stored hash.\n\n\nMany hash algorithms are designed to execute quickly with minimal overhead, even cryptographic hashes. However, this efficiency is a problem for password storage, because it can reduce an attacker's workload for brute-force password cracking. If an attacker can obtain the hashes through some other method (such as SQL injection on a database that stores hashes), then the attacker can store the hashes offline and use various techniques to crack the passwords by computing hashes efficiently. Without a built-in workload, modern attacks can compute large numbers of hashes, or even exhaust the entire space of all possible passwords, within a very short amount of time, using massively-parallel computing (such as cloud computing) and GPU, ASIC, or FPGA hardware. In such a scenario, an efficient hash algorithm helps the attacker.\n\n\nThere are several properties of a hash scheme that are relevant to its strength against an offline, massively-parallel attack:\n\n\n  - The amount of CPU time required to compute the hash (\"stretching\")\n\n  - The amount of memory required to compute the hash (\"memory-hard\" operations)\n\n  - Including a random value, along with the password, as input to the hash computation (\"salting\")\n\n  - Given a hash, there is no known way of determining an input (e.g., a password) that produces this hash value, other than by guessing possible inputs (\"one-way\" hashing)\n\n  - Relative to the number of all possible hashes that can be generated by the scheme, there is a low likelihood of producing the same hash for multiple different inputs (\"collision resistance\")\n\nNote that the security requirements for the product may vary depending on the environment and the value of the passwords. Different schemes might not provide all of these properties, yet may still provide sufficient security for the environment. Conversely, a solution might be very strong in preserving one property, which still being very weak for an attack against another property, or it might not be able to significantly reduce the efficiency of a massively-parallel attack.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2008-1526: Router does not use a salt with a hash, making it easier to crack passwords.\n\n- CVE-2006-1058: Router does not use a salt with a hash, making it easier to crack passwords.\n\n- CVE-2008-4905: Blogging software uses a hard-coded salt when calculating a password hash.\n\n- CVE-2002-1657: Database server uses the username for a salt when encrypting passwords, simplifying brute force attacks.\n\n- CVE-2001-0967: Server uses a constant salt when encrypting passwords, simplifying brute force attacks.\n\n- CVE-2005-0408: chain: product generates predictable MD5 hashes using a constant value combined with username, allowing authentication bypass.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-25754: An issue was discovered on Enphase Envoy R3.x and D4.x devices. There is a custom PAM module for user authentication that circumvents traditional user authentication. This module uses a password derived from the MD5 hash of the username and serial number. The serial number can be retrieved by an unauthenticated user at /info.xml. Attempts to change the user password via passwd or other tools have no effect.\n\n- CVE-2021-22741: Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort vulnerability exists in ClearSCADA (all versions), EcoStruxure Geo SCADA Expert 2019 (all versions), and EcoStruxure Geo SCADA Expert 2020 (V83.7742.1 and prior), which could cause the revealing of account credentials when server database files are available. Exposure of these files to an attacker can make the system vulnerable to password decryption attacks. Note that \u201c.sde\u201d configuration export files do not contain user account password hashes.\n\n- CVE-2021-32519: Use of password hash with insufficient computational effort vulnerability in QSAN Storage Manager, XEVO, SANOS allows remote attackers to recover the plain-text password by brute-forcing the MD5 hash. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.2, QSAN XEVO v2.1.0, and QSAN SANOS v2.1.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-33003: Delta Electronics DIAEnergie Version 1.7.5 and prior may allow an attacker to retrieve passwords in cleartext due to a weak hashing algorithm.\n\n- CVE-2021-37551: In JetBrains YouTrack before 2021.2.16363, system user passwords were hashed with SHA-256.\n\n- CVE-2021-38400: An attacker with physical access to Boston Scientific Zoom Latitude Model 3120 can remove the hard disk drive or create a specially crafted USB to extract the password hash for brute force reverse engineering of the system password.\n\n- CVE-2020-14516: In Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk Services Platform Versions 6.10.00 and 6.11.00, there is an issue with the implementation of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm with FactoryTalk Services Platform that prevents the user password from being hashed properly.\n\n- CVE-2021-36767: In Digi RealPort through 4.10.490, authentication relies on a challenge-response mechanism that gives access to the server password, making the protection ineffective. An attacker may send an unauthenticated request to the server. The server will reply with a weakly-hashed version of the server's access password. The attacker may then crack this hash offline in order to successfully login to the server.\n\n- CVE-2021-32997: The affected Baker Hughes Bentley Nevada products (3500 System 1 6.x, Part No. 3060/00 versions 6.98 and prior, 3500 System 1, Part No. 3071/xx & 3072/xx versions 21.1 HF1 and prior, 3500 Rack Configuration, Part No. 129133-01 versions 6.4 and prior, and 3500/22M Firmware, Part No. 288055-01 versions 5.05 and prior) utilize a weak encryption algorithm for storage and transmission of sensitive data, which may allow an attacker to more easily obtain credentials used for access.\n\n- CVE-2022-0022: Usage of a weak cryptographic algorithm in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software where the password hashes of administrator and local user accounts are not created with a sufficient level of computational effort, which allows for password cracking attacks on accounts in normal (non-FIPS-CC) operational mode. An attacker must have access to the account password hashes to take advantage of this weakness and can acquire those hashes if they are able to gain access to the PAN-OS software configuration. Fixed versions of PAN-OS software use a secure cryptographic algorithm for account password hashes. This issue does not impact Prisma Access firewalls. This issue impacts: PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.21; All versions of PAN-OS 9.0; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.11; PAN-OS 10.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.0.7.\n\n- CVE-2022-23348: BigAnt Software BigAnt Server v5.6.06 was discovered to utilize weak password hashes.\n\n- CVE-2022-26115: A use of password hash with insufficient computational effort vulnerability [CWE-916] in FortiSandbox before 4.2.0 may allow an attacker with access to the password database to efficiently mount bulk guessing attacks to recover the passwords.\n\n- CVE-2022-40258: AMI Megarac Weak password hashes for Redfish & API \n\n- CVE-2022-24041: A vulnerability has been identified in Desigo DXR2 (All versions < V01.21.142.5-22), Desigo PXC3 (All versions < V01.21.142.4-18), Desigo PXC4 (All versions < V02.20.142.10-10884), Desigo PXC5 (All versions < V02.20.142.10-10884). The web application stores the PBKDF2 derived key of users passwords with a low iteration count. An attacker with user profile access privilege can retrieve the stored password hashes of other accounts and then successfully perform an offline cracking attack and recover the plaintext passwords of other users.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-328 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-327 (ChildOf)",

In versions prior to 8.7.49, 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1 TYPO3 is vulnerable to Improper Authentication. Restricting frontend login to specific users, organized in different storage folders (partitions), can be bypassed. A potential attacker might use this ambiguity in usernames to get access to a different account - however, credentials must be known to the adversary. This issue is patched in versions 8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23600: fleet is an open source device management, built on osquery. Versions prior to 4.9.1 expose a limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with missing audience verification. This impacts deployments using SAML SSO in two specific cases: 1. A malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) could reuse the SAML response to log into Fleet as a user -- only if the user has an account with the same email in Fleet, _and_ the user signs into the malicious SP via SAML SSO from the same Identity Provider (IdP) configured with Fleet. 2. A user with an account in Fleet could reuse a SAML response intended for another SP to log into Fleet. This is only a concern if the user is blocked from Fleet in the IdP, but continues to have an account in Fleet. If the user is blocked from the IdP entirely, this cannot be exploited. Fleet 4.9.1 resolves this issue. Users unable to upgrade should: Reduce the length of sessions on your IdP to reduce the window for malicious re-use, Limit the amount of SAML Service Providers/Applications used by user accounts with access to Fleet, and When removing access to Fleet in the IdP, delete the Fleet user from Fleet as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24259: An incorrect check in the component cdr.php of Voipmonitor GUI before v24.96 allows unauthenticated attackers to escalate privileges via a crafted request.\n\n- CVE-2022-24883: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Prior to version 2.7.0, server side authentication against a `SAM` file might be successful for invalid credentials if the server has configured an invalid `SAM` file path. FreeRDP based clients are not affected. RDP server implementations using FreeRDP to authenticate against a `SAM` file are affected. Version 2.7.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, use custom authentication via `HashCallback` and/or ensure the `SAM` database path configured is valid and the application has file handles left.\n\n- CVE-2022-24885: Nextcloud Android app is the Android client for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to version 3.19.1, users can bypass a lock on the Nextcloud app on an Android device by repeatedly reopening the app. Version 3.19.1 contains a fix for the problem. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24976: Atheme IRC Services before 7.2.12, when used in conjunction with InspIRCd, allows authentication bypass by ending an IRC handshake at a certain point during a challenge-response login sequence.\n\n- CVE-2022-2533: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 12.10 before 15.1.6, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.4, all versions starting from 15.3 before 15.3.2. GitLab was not performing correct authentication with some Package Registries when IP address restrictions were configured, allowing an attacker already in possession of a valid Deploy Token to misuse it from any location.\n\n- CVE-2022-2553: The authfile directive in the booth config file is ignored, preventing use of authentication in communications from node to node. As a result, nodes that do not have the correct authentication key are not prevented from communicating with other nodes in the cluster.\n\n- CVE-2022-2572: In affected versions of Octopus Server where access is managed by an external authentication provider, it was possible that the API key/keys of a disabled/deleted user were still valid after the access was revoked.\n\n- CVE-2022-26504: Improper authentication in Veeam Backup & Replication 9.5U3, 9.5U4,10.x and 11.x component used for Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) allows attackers execute arbitrary code via Veeam.Backup.PSManager.exe\n\n- CVE-2022-26562: An issue in provider/libserver/ECKrbAuth.cpp of Kopano Core <= v11.0.2.51 contains an issue which allows attackers to authenticate even if the user account or password is expired. It also exists in the predecessor Zarafa Collaboration Platform (ZCP) in provider/libserver/ECPamAuth.cpp of Zarafa >= 6.30 (introduced between 6.30.0 RC1e and 6.30.8 final).\n\n- CVE-2022-3477: The tagDiv Composer WordPress plugin before 3.5, required by the Newspaper WordPress theme before 12.1 and Newsmag WordPress theme before 5.2.2, does not properly implement the Facebook login feature, allowing unauthenticated attackers to login as any user by just knowing their email address\n\n- CVE-2022-36106: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released under the GNU GPL. It has been discovered that the expiration time of a password reset link for TYPO3 backend users has never been evaluated. As a result, a password reset link could be used to perform a password reset even if the default expiry time of two hours has been exceeded. Update to TYPO3 version 10.4.32 or 11.5.16 that fix the problem. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36412: In Zoho ManageEngine SupportCenter Plus before 11023, V3 API requests are vulnerable to authentication bypass. (An API request may, in effect, be executed with the credentials of a user who authenticated in the past.)\n\n- CVE-2022-39238: Arvados is an open source platform for managing and analyzing biomedical big data. In versions prior to 2.4.3, when using Portable Authentication Modules (PAM) for user authentication, if a user presented valid credentials but the account is disabled or otherwise not allowed to access the host (such as an expired password), it would still be accepted for access to Arvados. Other authentication methods (LDAP, OpenID Connect) supported by Arvados are not affected by this flaw. This issue is patched in version 2.4.3. Workaround for this issue is to migrate to a different authentication method supported by Arvados, such as LDAP.\n\n- CVE-2022-39263: `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding.\n\n- CVE-2022-39355: Discourse Patreon enables syncronization between Discourse Groups and Patreon rewards.

This vulnerability is patched in commit number 846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e of the discourse-patreon plugin. Out of an abundance of caution, any Discourse accounts which have logged in with an unverified-email Patreon account will be logged out and asked to verify their email address on their next login. As a workaround, disable the patreon integration and log out all users with associated Patreon accounts.\n\n- CVE-2021-3632: A flaw was found in Keycloak. This vulnerability allows anyone to register a new security device or key when there is not a device already registered for any user by using the WebAuthn password-less login flow.\n\n- CVE-2022-46170: CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. When an application uses (1) multiple session cookies (e.g., one for user pages and one for admin pages) and (2) a session handler is set to `DatabaseHandler`, `MemcachedHandler`, or `RedisHandler`, then if an attacker gets one session cookie (e.g., one for user pages), they may be able to access pages that require another session cookie (e.g., for admin pages). This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.2.11 or later. As a workaround, use only one session cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-46316: A thread security vulnerability exists in the authentication process. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-30034: Flower, a web UI for the Celery Python RPC framework, all versions as of 05-02-2022 is vulnerable to an OAuth authentication bypass. An attacker could then access the Flower API to discover and invoke arbitrary Celery RPC calls or deny service by shutting down Celery task nodes.\n\n- CVE-2022-30124: An improper authentication vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat Mobile App <4.14.1.22788 that allowed an attacker with physical access to a mobile device to bypass local authentication (PIN code).\n\n- CVE-2021-43414: An issue was discovered in GNU Hurd before 0.9 20210404-9. The use of an authentication protocol in the proc server is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, which can be exploited for local privilege escalation to get full root access.\n\n- CVE-2022-21684: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Versions prior to 2.7.13 in `stable`, 2.8.0.beta11 in `beta`, and 2.8.0.beta11 in `tests-passed` allow some users to log in to a community before they should be able to do so. A user invited via email to a forum with `must_approve_users` enabled is going to be automatically logged in, bypassing the check that does not allow unapproved users to sign in. They will be able to do everything an approved user can do. If they logout, they cannot log back in. This issue is patched in the `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11. One may disable invites as a workaround. Administrators can increase `min_trust_level_to_allow_invite` to reduce the attack surface to more trusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-2303: An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1. It may be possible for group members to bypass 2FA enforcement enabled at the group level by using Resource Owner Password Credentials grant to obtain an access token without using 2FA.\n\n- CVE-2022-34908: An issue was discovered in the A4N (Aremis 4 Nomad) application 1.5.0 for Android. It possesses an authentication mechanism; however, some features do not require any token or cookie in a request. Therefore, an attacker may send a simple HTTP request to the right endpoint, and obtain authorization to retrieve application data.\n\n- CVE-2022-36755: D-Link DIR845L A1 contains a authentication vulnerability via an AUTHORIZED_GROUP=1 value, as demonstrated by a request for getcfg.php.\n\n- CVE-2022-43400: A vulnerability has been identified in Siveillance Video Mobile Server V2022 R2 (All versions < V22.2a (80)). The mobile server component of affected applications improperly handles the log in for Active Directory accounts that are part of Administrators group. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to access the application without a valid account.\n\n- CVE-2022-48066: An issue in the component global.so of Totolink A830R V4.1.2cu.5182 allows attackers to bypass authentication via a crafted cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-1053: Keylime does not enforce that the agent registrar data is the same when the tenant uses it for validation of the EK and identity quote and the verifier for validating the integrity quote. This allows an attacker to use one AK, EK pair from a real TPM to pass EK validation and give the verifier an AK of a software TPM. A successful attack breaks the entire chain of trust because a not validated AK is used by the verifier. This issue is worse if the validation happens first and then the agent gets added to the verifier because the timing is easier and the verifier does not validate the regcount entry being equal to 1,\n\n- CVE-2022-45124: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the User authentication functionality of WellinTech KingHistorian 35.01.00.05. A specially crafted network packet can lead to a disclosure of sensitive information. An attacker can sniff network traffic to leverage this vulnerability.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-287 (ChildOf)",

However, when these credentials are easily predictable or even fixed (as with default or hard-coded passwords and keys), then the attacker can defeat the mechanism without relying on brute force.\n\n\nCredentials may be weak for different reasons, such as:\n\n\n  - Hard-coded (i.e., static and unchangeable by the administrator)\n\n  - Default (i.e., the same static value across different deployments/installations, but able to be changed by the administrator)\n\n  - Predictable (i.e., generated in a way that produces unique credentials across deployments/installations, but can still be guessed with reasonable efficiency)\n\nEven if a new, unique credential is intended to be generated for each product installation, if the generation is predictable, then that may also simplify guessing attacks.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- [REF-1374]: Chain: JavaScript-based cryptocurrency library can fall back to the insecure Math.random() function instead of reporting a failure (CWE-392), thus reducing the entropy (CWE-332) and leading to generation of non-unique cryptographic keys for Bitcoin wallets (CWE-1391)\n\n- CVE-2022-30270: Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses default credentials for some SSH accounts\n\n- CVE-2022-29965: Distributed Control System (DCS) uses a deterministic algorithm to generate utility passwords\n\n- CVE-2022-30271: Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used in typical deployments\n\n- CVE-2021-38759: microcontroller board has default password, allowing admin access\n\n- CVE-2021-41192: data visualization/sharing package uses default secret keys or cookie values if they are not specified in environment variables\n\n- CVE-2020-8994: UART interface for AI speaker uses empty password for root shell\n\n- CVE-2020-27020: password manager does not generate cryptographically strong passwords, allowing prediction of passwords using guessable details such as time of generation\n\n- CVE-2020-8632: password generator for cloud application has small length value, making it easier for brute-force guessing\n\n- CVE-2020-5365: network-attached storage (NAS) system has predictable default passwords for a diagnostics/support account\n\n- CVE-2020-5248: IT asset management app has a default encryption key that is the same across installations\n\n- CVE-2018-3825: cloud cluster management product has a default master encryption key\n\n- CVE-2012-3503: Installation script has a hard-coded secret token value, allowing attackers to bypass authentication\n\n- CVE-2010-2306: Intrusion Detection System (IDS) uses the same static, private SSL keys for multiple devices and installations, allowing decryption of SSL traffic\n\n- CVE-2001-0618: Residential gateway uses the last 5 digits of the 'Network Name' or SSID as the default WEP key, which allows attackers to get the key by sniffing the SSID, which is sent in the clear\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-3875: A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Click Studios Passwordstate and Passwordstate Browser Extension Chrome. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the component API. The manipulation leads to authentication bypass by assumed-immutable data. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-216244.\n\n- CVE-2021-3979: A key length flaw was found in Red Hat Ceph Storage. An attacker can exploit the fact that the key length is incorrectly passed in an encryption algorithm to create a non random key, which is weaker and can be exploited for loss of confidentiality and integrity on encrypted disks.\n\n- CVE-2021-42949: The component controlla_login function in HotelDruid Hotel Management Software v3.0.3 generates a predictable session token, allowing attackers to bypass authentication via bruteforce attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-23555: authentik is an open-source Identity Provider focused on flexibility and versatility. Versions prior to 2022.11.4 and 2022.10.4 are vulnerable to Improper Authentication. Token reuse in invitation URLs leads to access control bypass via the use of a different enrollment flow than in the one provided. The vulnerability allows an attacker that knows different invitation flows names (e.g. `enrollment-invitation-test` and `enrollment-invitation-admin`) via either different invite links or via brute forcing to signup via a single invitation url for any valid invite link received (it can even be a url for a third flow as long as it's a valid invite) as the token used in the `Invitations` section of the Admin interface does NOT change when a different `enrollment flow` is selected via the interface and it is NOT bound to the selected flow, so it will be valid for any flow when used. This issue is patched in authentik 2022.11.4,2022.10.4 and 2022.12.0. Only configurations that use invitations and have multiple enrollment flows with invitation stages that grant different permissions are affected. The default configuration is not vulnerable, and neither are configurations with a single enrollment flow. As a workaround, fixed data can be added to invitations which can be checked in the flow to deny requests. Alternatively, an identifier with high entropy (like a UUID) can be used as flow slug, mitigating the attack vector by exponentially decreasing the possibility of discovering other flows.\n\n- CVE-2022-28376: Verizon 5G Home LVSKIHP outside devices through 2022-02-15 allow anyone (knowing the device's serial number) to access a CPE admin website, e.g., at the 10.0.0.1 IP address.

Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-10987: OS command injection in Wi-Fi router, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-10221: Template functionality in network configuration management tool allows OS command injection, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-9054: Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in username parameter, leading to OS command injection (CWE-78), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-1999-0067: Canonical example of OS command injection.

In affected versions a command injection vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on a server running Cacti, if a specific data source was selected for any monitored device. The vulnerability resides in the `remote_agent.php` file. This file can be accessed without authentication. This function retrieves the IP address of the client via `get_client_addr` and resolves this IP address to the corresponding hostname via `gethostbyaddr`. After this, it is verified that an entry within the `poller` table exists, where the hostname corresponds to the resolved hostname. If such an entry was found, the function returns `true` and the client is authorized. This authorization can be bypassed due to the implementation of the `get_client_addr` function. The function is defined in the file `lib/functions.php` and checks serval `$_SERVER` variables to determine the IP address of the client. The variables beginning with `HTTP_` can be arbitrarily set by an attacker. Since there is a default entry in the `poller` table with the hostname of the server running Cacti, an attacker can bypass the authentication e.g. by providing the header `Forwarded-For: <TARGETIP>`. This way the function `get_client_addr` returns the IP address of the server running Cacti. The following call to `gethostbyaddr` will resolve this IP address to the hostname of the server, which will pass the `poller` hostname check because of the default entry. After the authorization of the `remote_agent.php` file is bypassed, an attacker can trigger different actions. One of these actions is called `polldata`. The called function `poll_for_data` retrieves a few request parameters and loads the corresponding `poller_item` entries from the database. If the `action` of a `poller_item` equals `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP`, the function `proc_open` is used to execute a PHP script. The attacker-controlled parameter `$poller_id` is retrieved via the function `get_nfilter_request_var`, which allows arbitrary strings. This variable is later inserted into the string passed to `proc_open`, which leads to a command injection vulnerability. By e.g. providing the `poller_id=;id` the `id` command is executed. In order to reach the vulnerable call, the attacker must provide a `host_id` and `local_data_id`, where the `action` of the corresponding `poller_item` is set to `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP`. Both of these ids (`host_id` and `local_data_id`) can easily be bruteforced. The only requirement is that a `poller_item` with an `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP` action exists. This is very likely on a productive instance because this action is added by some predefined templates like `Device - Uptime` or `Device - Polling Time`. This command injection vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary commands if a `poller_item` with the `action` type `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP` (`2`) is configured. The authorization bypass should be prevented by not allowing an attacker to make `get_client_addr` (file `lib/functions.php`) return an arbitrary IP address. This could be done by not honoring the `HTTP_...` `$_SERVER` variables. If these should be kept for compatibility reasons it should at least be prevented to fake the IP address of the server running Cacti. This vulnerability has been addressed in both the 1.2.x and 1.3.x release branches with `1.2.23` being the first release containing the patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-42759: A violation of secure design principles in Fortinet Meru AP version 8.6.1 and below, version 8.5.5 and below allows attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands via crafted cli commands.\n\n- CVE-2021-43073: A improper neutralization of special elements used in an os command ('os command injection') in Fortinet FortiWeb version 6.4.1 and 6.4.0, version 6.3.15 and below, version 6.2.6 and below allows attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands via crafted HTTP requests.\n\n- CVE-2021-43075: A improper neutralization of special elements used in an os command ('os command injection') in Fortinet FortiWLM version 8.6.2 and below, version 8.5.2 and below, version 8.4.2 and below, version 8.3.2 and below allows attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands via crafted HTTP requests to the alarm dashboard and controller config handlers.\n\n- CVE-2021-43928: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command ('OS Command Injection') vulnerability in mail sending and receiving component in Synology Mail Station before 20211105-10315 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary commands via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2021-44171: A improper neutralization of special elements used in an os command ('os command injection') in Fortinet FortiOS version 6.0.0 through 6.0.14, FortiOS version 6.2.0 through 6.2.10, FortiOS version 6.4.0 through 6.4.8, FortiOS version 7.0.0 through 7.0.3 allows attacker to execute privileged commands on a linked FortiSwitch via diagnostic CLI commands.\n\n- CVE-2022-1703: Improper neutralization of special elements in the SonicWall SSL-VPN SMA100 series management interface allows a remote authenticated attacker to inject OS Commands which potentially leads to remote command execution vulnerability or denial of service (DoS) attack.\n\n- CVE-2022-22273: Improper neutralization of Special Elements leading to OS Command Injection vulnerability impacting end-of-life Secure Remote Access (SRA) products and older firmware versions of Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 series products, specifically the SRA appliances running all 8.x, 9.0.0.5-19sv and earlier versions and Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 series products running older firmware 9.0.0.9-26sv and earlier versions\n\n- CVE-2022-22301: An improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS Command vulnerability [CWE-78] in FortiAP-C console 5.4.0 through 5.4.3, 5.2.0 through 5.2.1 may allow an authenticated attacker to execute unauthorized commands by running CLI commands with specifically crafted arguments.\n\n- CVE-2022-22684: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command ('OS Command Injection') vulnerability in task management component in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.4-25553 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary commands via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2022-2185: A critical issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 14.0 prior to 14.10.5, 15.0 prior to 15.0.4, and 15.1 prior to 15.1.1 where an authenticated user authorized to import projects could import a maliciously crafted project leading to remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-4257: A vulnerability was found in C-DATA Web Management System.

A successful exploit allows attackers to run arbitrary commands on the host system where the Snyk CLI is installed by passing in crafted command line flags. In order to exploit this vulnerability, a user would have to execute the snyk test command on untrusted files. In most cases, an attacker positioned to control the command line arguments to the Snyk CLI would already be positioned to execute arbitrary commands. However, this could be abused in specific scenarios, such as continuous integration pipelines, where developers can control the arguments passed to the Snyk CLI to leverage this component as part of a wider attack against an integration/build pipeline.

These credentials are stored in the `squashfs-root/etc/passwd` and `squashfs-root/etc/passwd.bak` files, with the password MD5 hashed but easily cracked.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n- Hardcoded credentials\n- Weak password (\"1234\")\n- Credentials stored in easily accessible files within the firmware\n\nImpact of exploitation:\nSuccessful exploitation grants an attacker root user privilege on the router.\n\nAttack vectors:\n- Physical access to the router's SPI flash memory.\n- Downloading the firmware from the manufacturer's website.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\n- Ability to obtain the firmware (either physically or via download).\n- Basic knowledge of firmware analysis tools (binwalk, FirmAudit).\n- Ability to crack MD5 hashes (using tools like hashcat or john the ripper).\n- (For validation) Access to a UART port and communication capabilities.\n\nMitigation or fix:\nThe content does not specify a mitigation or fix, but implies that changing the default credentials and avoiding hardcoding them in the firmware would resolve the issue.\n\nAdditional details:\n- Affected models: TP-Link TL-WR845N\n- Affected firmware versions: TL-WR845N(UN)_V4_190219, TL-WR845N(UN)_V4_200909, TL-WR845N(UN)_V4_201214\n- The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including specific file paths, commands for extraction and analysis, and validation steps.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 259 | Use of Hard-coded Password | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.302 |\n| 2 | 798 | Use of Hard-coded Credentials | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.286 |\n| 3 | 321 | Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.269 |\n| 4 | 522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.232 |\n| 5 | 425 | Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.231 |\n| 6 | 1393 | Use of Default Password | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.506 |\n| 7 | 471 | Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID) | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 916 | Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.231 |\n| 9 | 1390 | Weak Authentication | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.225 |\n| 10 | 326 | Inadequate Encryption Strength | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.225 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nA hard-coded password typically leads to a significant authentication failure that can be difficult for the system administrator to detect. Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:\n\n```\n\t\tInbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.\n\t\tOutbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.\n```\nIn the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\n\nThe Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nPeerOf -> CWE-321\nPeerOf -> CWE-257\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry could be split into multiple variants: an inbound variant (as seen in the second demonstrative example) and an outbound variant (as seen in the first demonstrative example). These variants are likely to have different consequences, detectability, etc. More importantly, from a vulnerability theory perspective, they could be characterized as different behaviors.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29964:** Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access\n- **CVE-2021-37555:** Telnet service for IoT feeder for dogs and cats has hard-coded password [REF-1288]\n- **CVE-2021-35033:** Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThere are two main variations:\n\n\n  - Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks the input credentials against a hard-coded set of credentials. In this variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. It can also be difficult for the administrator to detect.\n\n  - Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. This variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password that can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1391\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-344\nChildOf -> CWE-671\nPeerOf -> CWE-257\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29953:** Condition Monitor firmware has a maintenance interface with hard-coded credentials\n- **CVE-2022-29960:** Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation\n- **CVE-2022-29964:** Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** The main difference between the use of hard-coded passwords and the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys is the false sense of security that the former conveys. Many people believe that simply hashing a hard-coded password before storage will protect the information from malicious users. However, many hashes are reversible (or at least vulnerable to brute force attacks) -- and further, many authentication protocols simply request the hash itself, making it no better than a password.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions.

The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29960:** Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation\n- **CVE-2022-30271:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used by default.\n- **CVE-2020-10884:** WiFi router service has a hard-coded encryption key, allowing root access\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30018:** A messaging platform serializes all elements of User/Group objects, making private information available to adversaries\n- **CVE-2022-29959:** Initialization file contains credentials that can be decoded using a \"simple string transformation\"\n- **CVE-2022-35411:** Python-based RPC framework enables pickle functionality by default, allowing clients to unpickle untrusted data.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n### Extended Description\nWeb applications susceptible to direct request attacks often make the false assumption that such resources can only be reached through a given navigation path and so only apply authorization at certain points in the path.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nforced browsing: The \"forced browsing\" term could be misinterpreted to include weaknesses such as CSRF or XSS, so its use is discouraged.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-862\nChildOf -> CWE-862\nChildOf -> CWE-288\nChildOf -> CWE-424\nCanPrecede -> CWE-471\nCanPrecede -> CWE-98\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

The application does not verify that the first step was performed successfully before the second step.

The rationale is to simplify the manufacturing process or the system administrator's task of installation and deployment into an enterprise. However, if admins do not change the defaults, then it makes it easier for attackers to quickly bypass authentication across multiple organizations. There are many lists of default passwords and default-password scanning tools that are easily available from the World Wide Web.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1392\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

However, MAID issues can also be resultant from weaknesses that modify internal state; for example, a program might validate some data and store it in memory, but a buffer overflow could overwrite that validated data, leading to a change in program logic.\n\n**[Theoretical]** There are many examples where the MUTABILITY property is a major factor in a vulnerability.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-1757:** Relies on $PHP_SELF variable for authentication.\n- **CVE-2005-1905:** Gain privileges by modifying assumed-immutable code addresses that are accessed by a driver.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany password storage mechanisms compute a hash and store the hash, instead of storing the original password in plaintext. In this design, authentication involves accepting an incoming password, computing its hash, and comparing it to the stored hash.\n\n\nMany hash algorithms are designed to execute quickly with minimal overhead, even cryptographic hashes. However, this efficiency is a problem for password storage, because it can reduce an attacker's workload for brute-force password cracking. If an attacker can obtain the hashes through some other method (such as SQL injection on a database that stores hashes), then the attacker can store the hashes offline and use various techniques to crack the passwords by computing hashes efficiently. Without a built-in workload, modern attacks can compute large numbers of hashes, or even exhaust the entire space of all possible passwords, within a very short amount of time, using massively-parallel computing (such as cloud computing) and GPU, ASIC, or FPGA hardware. In such a scenario, an efficient hash algorithm helps the attacker.\n\n\nThere are several properties of a hash scheme that are relevant to its strength against an offline, massively-parallel attack:\n\n\n  - The amount of CPU time required to compute the hash (\"stretching\")\n\n  - The amount of memory required to compute the hash (\"memory-hard\" operations)\n\n  - Including a random value, along with the password, as input to the hash computation (\"salting\")\n\n  - Given a hash, there is no known way of determining an input (e.g., a password) that produces this hash value, other than by guessing possible inputs (\"one-way\" hashing)\n\n  - Relative to the number of all possible hashes that can be generated by the scheme, there is a low likelihood of producing the same hash for multiple different inputs (\"collision resistance\")\n\nNote that the security requirements for the product may vary depending on the environment and the value of the passwords. Different schemes might not provide all of these properties, yet may still provide sufficient security for the environment. Conversely, a solution might be very strong in preserving one property, which still being very weak for an attack against another property, or it might not be able to significantly reduce the efficiency of a massively-parallel attack.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-328\nChildOf -> CWE-327\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:\n\n```\n\t\tInbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.\n\t\tOutbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.\n```\nIn the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\n\nThe Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-29964: Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access\n\n- CVE-2021-37555: Telnet service for IoT feeder for dogs and cats has hard-coded password [REF-1288]\n\n- CVE-2021-35033: Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-27438: The software contains a hard-coded password it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components on the Reason DR60 (all firmware versions prior to 02A04.1).\n\n- CVE-2021-34757: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Business 220 Series Smart Switches firmware could allow an attacker with Administrator privileges to access sensitive login credentials or reconfigure the passwords on the user account.

In this variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. It can also be difficult for the administrator to detect.\n\n  - Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. This variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password that can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-29953: Condition Monitor firmware has a maintenance interface with hard-coded credentials\n\n- CVE-2022-29960: Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation\n\n- CVE-2022-29964: Distributed Control System (DCS) has hard-coded passwords for local shell access\n\n- CVE-2022-30997: Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has a maintenance service that uses undocumented, hard-coded credentials\n\n- CVE-2022-30314: Firmware for a Safety Instrumented System (SIS) has hard-coded credentials for access to boot configuration\n\n- CVE-2022-30271: Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used in typical deployments\n\n- CVE-2021-37555: Telnet service for IoT feeder for dogs and cats has hard-coded password [REF-1288]\n\n- CVE-2021-35033: Firmware for a WiFi router uses a hard-coded password for a BusyBox shell, allowing bypass of authentication through the UART port\n\n- CVE-2012-3503: Installation script has a hard-coded secret token value, allowing attackers to bypass authentication\n\n- CVE-2010-2772: SCADA system uses a hard-coded password to protect back-end database containing authorization information, exploited by Stuxnet worm\n\n- CVE-2010-2073: FTP server library uses hard-coded usernames and passwords for three default accounts\n\n- CVE-2010-1573: Chain: Router firmware uses hard-coded username and password for access to debug functionality, which can be used to execute arbitrary code\n\n- CVE-2008-2369: Server uses hard-coded authentication key\n\n- CVE-2008-0961: Backup product uses hard-coded username and password, allowing attackers to bypass authentication via the RPC interface\n\n- CVE-2008-1160: Security appliance uses hard-coded password allowing attackers to gain root access\n\n- CVE-2006-7142: Drive encryption product stores hard-coded cryptographic keys for encrypted configuration files in executable programs\n\n- CVE-2005-3716: VoIP product uses hard-coded public credentials that cannot be changed, which allows attackers to obtain sensitive information\n\n- CVE-2005-3803: VoIP product uses hard coded public and private SNMP community strings that cannot be changed, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information\n\n- CVE-2005-0496: Backup product contains hard-coded credentials that effectively serve as a back door, which allows remote attackers to access the file system\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-25560: In SapphireIMS 5.0, it is possible to use the hardcoded credential in clients (username: sapphire, password: ims) and gain access to the portal.

It mishandles software updates such that local third-party apps can provide a spoofed software update file that contains an arbitrary shell script and arbitrary ARM binary, where both will be executed as the root user with an SELinux domain named osi. To exploit this vulnerability, a local third-party app needs to have write access to external storage to write the spoofed update at the expected path. The vulnerable system binary (i.e., /system/bin/osi_bin) does not perform any authentication of the update file beyond ensuring that it is encrypted with an AES key (that is hard-coded in the vulnerable system binary). Processes executing with the osi SELinux domain can programmatically perform the following actions: install apps, grant runtime permissions to apps (including permissions with protection levels of dangerous and development), access extensive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) using the programmatically grant permissions, uninstall apps, set the default launcher app to a malicious launcher app that spoofs other apps, set a network proxy to intercept network traffic, unload kernel modules, set the default keyboard to a keyboard that has keylogging functionality, examine notification contents, send text messages, and more. The spoofed update can optionally contain an arbitrary ARM binary that will be locally stored in internal storage and executed at system startup to achieve persistent code execution as the root user with the osi SELinux domain. This ARM binary will continue to execute at startup even if the app that provided the spoofed update is uninstalled.\n\n- CVE-2020-7352: The GalaxyClientService component of GOG Galaxy runs with elevated SYSTEM privileges in a Windows environment. Due to the software shipping with embedded, static RSA private key, an attacker with this key material and local user permissions can effectively send any operating system command to the service for execution in this elevated context.

        "matched_text": "CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n\nType: Base\n\nStatus: Incomplete\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nMany password storage mechanisms compute a hash and store the hash, instead of storing the original password in plaintext. In this design, authentication involves accepting an incoming password, computing its hash, and comparing it to the stored hash.\n\n\nMany hash algorithms are designed to execute quickly with minimal overhead, even cryptographic hashes. However, this efficiency is a problem for password storage, because it can reduce an attacker's workload for brute-force password cracking. If an attacker can obtain the hashes through some other method (such as SQL injection on a database that stores hashes), then the attacker can store the hashes offline and use various techniques to crack the passwords by computing hashes efficiently. Without a built-in workload, modern attacks can compute large numbers of hashes, or even exhaust the entire space of all possible passwords, within a very short amount of time, using massively-parallel computing (such as cloud computing) and GPU, ASIC, or FPGA hardware. In such a scenario, an efficient hash algorithm helps the attacker.\n\n\nThere are several properties of a hash scheme that are relevant to its strength against an offline, massively-parallel attack:\n\n\n  - The amount of CPU time required to compute the hash (\"stretching\")\n\n  - The amount of memory required to compute the hash (\"memory-hard\" operations)\n\n  - Including a random value, along with the password, as input to the hash computation (\"salting\")\n\n  - Given a hash, there is no known way of determining an input (e.g., a password) that produces this hash value, other than by guessing possible inputs (\"one-way\" hashing)\n\n  - Relative to the number of all possible hashes that can be generated by the scheme, there is a low likelihood of producing the same hash for multiple different inputs (\"collision resistance\")\n\nNote that the security requirements for the product may vary depending on the environment and the value of the passwords. Different schemes might not provide all of these properties, yet may still provide sufficient security for the environment. Conversely, a solution might be very strong in preserving one property, which still being very weak for an attack against another property, or it might not be able to significantly reduce the efficiency of a massively-parallel attack.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2008-1526: Router does not use a salt with a hash, making it easier to crack passwords.\n\n- CVE-2006-1058: Router does not use a salt with a hash, making it easier to crack passwords.\n\n- CVE-2008-4905: Blogging software uses a hard-coded salt when calculating a password hash.\n\n- CVE-2002-1657: Database server uses the username for a salt when encrypting passwords, simplifying brute force attacks.\n\n- CVE-2001-0967: Server uses a constant salt when encrypting passwords, simplifying brute force attacks.\n\n- CVE-2005-0408: chain: product generates predictable MD5 hashes using a constant value combined with username, allowing authentication bypass.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-25754: An issue was discovered on Enphase Envoy R3.x and D4.x devices. There is a custom PAM module for user authentication that circumvents traditional user authentication. This module uses a password derived from the MD5 hash of the username and serial number. The serial number can be retrieved by an unauthenticated user at /info.xml. Attempts to change the user password via passwd or other tools have no effect.\n\n- CVE-2021-22741: Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort vulnerability exists in ClearSCADA (all versions), EcoStruxure Geo SCADA Expert 2019 (all versions), and EcoStruxure Geo SCADA Expert 2020 (V83.7742.1 and prior), which could cause the revealing of account credentials when server database files are available. Exposure of these files to an attacker can make the system vulnerable to password decryption attacks. Note that \u201c.sde\u201d configuration export files do not contain user account password hashes.\n\n- CVE-2021-32519: Use of password hash with insufficient computational effort vulnerability in QSAN Storage Manager, XEVO, SANOS allows remote attackers to recover the plain-text password by brute-forcing the MD5 hash. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.2, QSAN XEVO v2.1.0, and QSAN SANOS v2.1.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-33003: Delta Electronics DIAEnergie Version 1.7.5 and prior may allow an attacker to retrieve passwords in cleartext due to a weak hashing algorithm.\n\n- CVE-2021-37551: In JetBrains YouTrack before 2021.2.16363, system user passwords were hashed with SHA-256.\n\n- CVE-2021-38400: An attacker with physical access to Boston Scientific Zoom Latitude Model 3120 can remove the hard disk drive or create a specially crafted USB to extract the password hash for brute force reverse engineering of the system password.\n\n- CVE-2020-14516: In Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk Services Platform Versions 6.10.00 and 6.11.00, there is an issue with the implementation of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm with FactoryTalk Services Platform that prevents the user password from being hashed properly.\n\n- CVE-2021-36767: In Digi RealPort through 4.10.490, authentication relies on a challenge-response mechanism that gives access to the server password, making the protection ineffective. An attacker may send an unauthenticated request to the server. The server will reply with a weakly-hashed version of the server's access password. The attacker may then crack this hash offline in order to successfully login to the server.\n\n- CVE-2021-32997: The affected Baker Hughes Bentley Nevada products (3500 System 1 6.x, Part No. 3060/00 versions 6.98 and prior, 3500 System 1, Part No. 3071/xx & 3072/xx versions 21.1 HF1 and prior, 3500 Rack Configuration, Part No. 129133-01 versions 6.4 and prior, and 3500/22M Firmware, Part No. 288055-01 versions 5.05 and prior) utilize a weak encryption algorithm for storage and transmission of sensitive data, which may allow an attacker to more easily obtain credentials used for access.\n\n- CVE-2022-0022: Usage of a weak cryptographic algorithm in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software where the password hashes of administrator and local user accounts are not created with a sufficient level of computational effort, which allows for password cracking attacks on accounts in normal (non-FIPS-CC) operational mode. An attacker must have access to the account password hashes to take advantage of this weakness and can acquire those hashes if they are able to gain access to the PAN-OS software configuration. Fixed versions of PAN-OS software use a secure cryptographic algorithm for account password hashes. This issue does not impact Prisma Access firewalls. This issue impacts: PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.21; All versions of PAN-OS 9.0; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.11; PAN-OS 10.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.0.7.\n\n- CVE-2022-23348: BigAnt Software BigAnt Server v5.6.06 was discovered to utilize weak password hashes.\n\n- CVE-2022-26115: A use of password hash with insufficient computational effort vulnerability [CWE-916] in FortiSandbox before 4.2.0 may allow an attacker with access to the password database to efficiently mount bulk guessing attacks to recover the passwords.\n\n- CVE-2022-40258: AMI Megarac Weak password hashes for Redfish & API \n\n- CVE-2022-24041: A vulnerability has been identified in Desigo DXR2 (All versions < V01.21.142.5-22), Desigo PXC3 (All versions < V01.21.142.4-18), Desigo PXC4 (All versions < V02.20.142.10-10884), Desigo PXC5 (All versions < V02.20.142.10-10884). The web application stores the PBKDF2 derived key of users passwords with a low iteration count. An attacker with user profile access privilege can retrieve the stored password hashes of other accounts and then successfully perform an offline cracking attack and recover the plaintext passwords of other users.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-328 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-327 (ChildOf)",

Restricting frontend login to specific users, organized in different storage folders (partitions), can be bypassed. A potential attacker might use this ambiguity in usernames to get access to a different account - however, credentials must be known to the adversary. This issue is patched in versions 8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23600: fleet is an open source device management, built on osquery. Versions prior to 4.9.1 expose a limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with missing audience verification. This impacts deployments using SAML SSO in two specific cases: 1. A malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) could reuse the SAML response to log into Fleet as a user -- only if the user has an account with the same email in Fleet, _and_ the user signs into the malicious SP via SAML SSO from the same Identity Provider (IdP) configured with Fleet. 2. A user with an account in Fleet could reuse a SAML response intended for another SP to log into Fleet. This is only a concern if the user is blocked from Fleet in the IdP, but continues to have an account in Fleet. If the user is blocked from the IdP entirely, this cannot be exploited. Fleet 4.9.1 resolves this issue. Users unable to upgrade should: Reduce the length of sessions on your IdP to reduce the window for malicious re-use, Limit the amount of SAML Service Providers/Applications used by user accounts with access to Fleet, and When removing access to Fleet in the IdP, delete the Fleet user from Fleet as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24259: An incorrect check in the component cdr.php of Voipmonitor GUI before v24.96 allows unauthenticated attackers to escalate privileges via a crafted request.\n\n- CVE-2022-24883: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Prior to version 2.7.0, server side authentication against a `SAM` file might be successful for invalid credentials if the server has configured an invalid `SAM` file path. FreeRDP based clients are not affected. RDP server implementations using FreeRDP to authenticate against a `SAM` file are affected. Version 2.7.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, use custom authentication via `HashCallback` and/or ensure the `SAM` database path configured is valid and the application has file handles left.\n\n- CVE-2022-24885: Nextcloud Android app is the Android client for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to version 3.19.1, users can bypass a lock on the Nextcloud app on an Android device by repeatedly reopening the app. Version 3.19.1 contains a fix for the problem. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24976: Atheme IRC Services before 7.2.12, when used in conjunction with InspIRCd, allows authentication bypass by ending an IRC handshake at a certain point during a challenge-response login sequence.\n\n- CVE-2022-2533: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 12.10 before 15.1.6, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.4, all versions starting from 15.3 before 15.3.2. GitLab was not performing correct authentication with some Package Registries when IP address restrictions were configured, allowing an attacker already in possession of a valid Deploy Token to misuse it from any location.\n\n- CVE-2022-2553: The authfile directive in the booth config file is ignored, preventing use of authentication in communications from node to node. As a result, nodes that do not have the correct authentication key are not prevented from communicating with other nodes in the cluster.\n\n- CVE-2022-2572: In affected versions of Octopus Server where access is managed by an external authentication provider, it was possible that the API key/keys of a disabled/deleted user were still valid after the access was revoked.\n\n- CVE-2022-26504: Improper authentication in Veeam Backup & Replication 9.5U3, 9.5U4,10.x and 11.x component used for Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) allows attackers execute arbitrary code via Veeam.Backup.PSManager.exe\n\n- CVE-2022-26562: An issue in provider/libserver/ECKrbAuth.cpp of Kopano Core <= v11.0.2.51 contains an issue which allows attackers to authenticate even if the user account or password is expired. It also exists in the predecessor Zarafa Collaboration Platform (ZCP) in provider/libserver/ECPamAuth.cpp of Zarafa >= 6.30 (introduced between 6.30.0 RC1e and 6.30.8 final).\n\n- CVE-2022-3477: The tagDiv Composer WordPress plugin before 3.5, required by the Newspaper WordPress theme before 12.1 and Newsmag WordPress theme before 5.2.2, does not properly implement the Facebook login feature, allowing unauthenticated attackers to login as any user by just knowing their email address\n\n- CVE-2022-36106: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released under the GNU GPL. It has been discovered that the expiration time of a password reset link for TYPO3 backend users has never been evaluated. As a result, a password reset link could be used to perform a password reset even if the default expiry time of two hours has been exceeded. Update to TYPO3 version 10.4.32 or 11.5.16 that fix the problem. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36412: In Zoho ManageEngine SupportCenter Plus before 11023, V3 API requests are vulnerable to authentication bypass. (An API request may, in effect, be executed with the credentials of a user who authenticated in the past.)\n\n- CVE-2022-39238: Arvados is an open source platform for managing and analyzing biomedical big data. In versions prior to 2.4.3, when using Portable Authentication Modules (PAM) for user authentication, if a user presented valid credentials but the account is disabled or otherwise not allowed to access the host (such as an expired password), it would still be accepted for access to Arvados. Other authentication methods (LDAP, OpenID Connect) supported by Arvados are not affected by this flaw. This issue is patched in version 2.4.3. Workaround for this issue is to migrate to a different authentication method supported by Arvados, such as LDAP.\n\n- CVE-2022-39263: `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding.\n\n- CVE-2022-39355: Discourse Patreon enables syncronization between Discourse Groups and Patreon rewards. On sites with Patreon login enabled, an improper authentication vulnerability could be used to take control of a victim's forum account. This vulnerability is patched in commit number 846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e of the discourse-patreon plugin. Out of an abundance of caution, any Discourse accounts which have logged in with an unverified-email Patreon account will be logged out and asked to verify their email address on their next login. As a workaround, disable the patreon integration and log out all users with associated Patreon accounts.\n\n- CVE-2021-3632: A flaw was found in Keycloak. This vulnerability allows anyone to register a new security device or key when there is not a device already registered for any user by using the WebAuthn password-less login flow.\n\n- CVE-2022-46170: CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. When an application uses (1) multiple session cookies (e.g., one for user pages and one for admin pages) and (2) a session handler is set to `DatabaseHandler`, `MemcachedHandler`, or `RedisHandler`, then if an attacker gets one session cookie (e.g., one for user pages), they may be able to access pages that require another session cookie (e.g., for admin pages). This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.2.11 or later. As a workaround, use only one session cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-46316: A thread security vulnerability exists in the authentication process. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-30034: Flower, a web UI for the Celery Python RPC framework, all versions as of 05-02-2022 is vulnerable to an OAuth authentication bypass.

The use of an authentication protocol in the proc server is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, which can be exploited for local privilege escalation to get full root access.\n\n- CVE-2022-21684: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Versions prior to 2.7.13 in `stable`, 2.8.0.beta11 in `beta`, and 2.8.0.beta11 in `tests-passed` allow some users to log in to a community before they should be able to do so. A user invited via email to a forum with `must_approve_users` enabled is going to be automatically logged in, bypassing the check that does not allow unapproved users to sign in. They will be able to do everything an approved user can do. If they logout, they cannot log back in. This issue is patched in the `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11. One may disable invites as a workaround. Administrators can increase `min_trust_level_to_allow_invite` to reduce the attack surface to more trusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-2303: An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1. It may be possible for group members to bypass 2FA enforcement enabled at the group level by using Resource Owner Password Credentials grant to obtain an access token without using 2FA.\n\n- CVE-2022-34908: An issue was discovered in the A4N (Aremis 4 Nomad) application 1.5.0 for Android. It possesses an authentication mechanism; however, some features do not require any token or cookie in a request. Therefore, an attacker may send a simple HTTP request to the right endpoint, and obtain authorization to retrieve application data.\n\n- CVE-2022-36755: D-Link DIR845L A1 contains a authentication vulnerability via an AUTHORIZED_GROUP=1 value, as demonstrated by a request for getcfg.php.\n\n- CVE-2022-43400: A vulnerability has been identified in Siveillance Video Mobile Server V2022 R2 (All versions < V22.2a (80)). The mobile server component of affected applications improperly handles the log in for Active Directory accounts that are part of Administrators group. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to access the application without a valid account.\n\n- CVE-2022-48066: An issue in the component global.so of Totolink A830R V4.1.2cu.5182 allows attackers to bypass authentication via a crafted cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-1053: Keylime does not enforce that the agent registrar data is the same when the tenant uses it for validation of the EK and identity quote and the verifier for validating the integrity quote. This allows an attacker to use one AK, EK pair from a real TPM to pass EK validation and give the verifier an AK of a software TPM. A successful attack breaks the entire chain of trust because a not validated AK is used by the verifier. This issue is worse if the validation happens first and then the agent gets added to the verifier because the timing is easier and the verifier does not validate the regcount entry being equal to 1,\n\n- CVE-2022-45124: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the User authentication functionality of WellinTech KingHistorian 35.01.00.05. A specially crafted network packet can lead to a disclosure of sensitive information.

        "matched_text": "CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n\nType: Class\n\nStatus: Incomplete\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nBy design, authentication protocols try to ensure that attackers must perform brute force attacks if they do not know the credentials such as a key or password. However, when these credentials are easily predictable or even fixed (as with default or hard-coded passwords and keys), then the attacker can defeat the mechanism without relying on brute force.\n\n\nCredentials may be weak for different reasons, such as:\n\n\n  - Hard-coded (i.e., static and unchangeable by the administrator)\n\n  - Default (i.e., the same static value across different deployments/installations, but able to be changed by the administrator)\n\n  - Predictable (i.e., generated in a way that produces unique credentials across deployments/installations, but can still be guessed with reasonable efficiency)\n\nEven if a new, unique credential is intended to be generated for each product installation, if the generation is predictable, then that may also simplify guessing attacks.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- [REF-1374]: Chain: JavaScript-based cryptocurrency library can fall back to the insecure Math.random() function instead of reporting a failure (CWE-392), thus reducing the entropy (CWE-332) and leading to generation of non-unique cryptographic keys for Bitcoin wallets (CWE-1391)\n\n- CVE-2022-30270: Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses default credentials for some SSH accounts\n\n- CVE-2022-29965: Distributed Control System (DCS) uses a deterministic algorithm to generate utility passwords\n\n- CVE-2022-30271: Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used in typical deployments\n\n- CVE-2021-38759: microcontroller board has default password, allowing admin access\n\n- CVE-2021-41192: data visualization/sharing package uses default secret keys or cookie values if they are not specified in environment variables\n\n- CVE-2020-8994: UART interface for AI speaker uses empty password for root shell\n\n- CVE-2020-27020: password manager does not generate cryptographically strong passwords, allowing prediction of passwords using guessable details such as time of generation\n\n- CVE-2020-8632: password generator for cloud application has small length value, making it easier for brute-force guessing\n\n- CVE-2020-5365: network-attached storage (NAS) system has predictable default passwords for a diagnostics/support account\n\n- CVE-2020-5248: IT asset management app has a default encryption key that is the same across installations\n\n- CVE-2018-3825: cloud cluster management product has a default master encryption key\n\n- CVE-2012-3503: Installation script has a hard-coded secret token value, allowing attackers to bypass authentication\n\n- CVE-2010-2306: Intrusion Detection System (IDS) uses the same static, private SSL keys for multiple devices and installations, allowing decryption of SSL traffic\n\n- CVE-2001-0618: Residential gateway uses the last 5 digits of the 'Network Name' or SSID as the default WEP key, which allows attackers to get the key by sniffing the SSID, which is sent in the clear\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-3875: A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Click Studios Passwordstate and Passwordstate Browser Extension Chrome. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the component API. The manipulation leads to authentication bypass by assumed-immutable data. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-216244.\n\n- CVE-2021-3979: A key length flaw was found in Red Hat Ceph Storage. An attacker can exploit the fact that the key length is incorrectly passed in an encryption algorithm to create a non random key, which is weaker and can be exploited for loss of confidentiality and integrity on encrypted disks.\n\n- CVE-2021-42949: The component controlla_login function in HotelDruid Hotel Management Software v3.0.3 generates a predictable session token, allowing attackers to bypass authentication via bruteforce attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-23555: authentik is an open-source Identity Provider focused on flexibility and versatility. Versions prior to 2022.11.4 and 2022.10.4 are vulnerable to Improper Authentication. Token reuse in invitation URLs leads to access control bypass via the use of a different enrollment flow than in the one provided. The vulnerability allows an attacker that knows different invitation flows names (e.g. `enrollment-invitation-test` and `enrollment-invitation-admin`) via either different invite links or via brute forcing to signup via a single invitation url for any valid invite link received (it can even be a url for a third flow as long as it's a valid invite) as the token used in the `Invitations` section of the Admin interface does NOT change when a different `enrollment flow` is selected via the interface and it is NOT bound to the selected flow, so it will be valid for any flow when used. This issue is patched in authentik 2022.11.4,2022.10.4 and 2022.12.0. Only configurations that use invitations and have multiple enrollment flows with invitation stages that grant different permissions are affected. The default configuration is not vulnerable, and neither are configurations with a single enrollment flow. As a workaround, fixed data can be added to invitations which can be checked in the flow to deny requests. Alternatively, an identifier with high entropy (like a UUID) can be used as flow slug, mitigating the attack vector by exponentially decreasing the possibility of discovering other flows.\n\n- CVE-2022-28376: Verizon 5G Home LVSKIHP outside devices through 2022-02-15 allow anyone (knowing the device's serial number) to access a CPE admin website, e.g., at the 10.0.0.1 IP address. The password (for the verizon username) is calculated by concatenating the serial number and the model (i.e., the LVSKIHP string), running the sha256sum program, and extracting the first seven characters concatenated with the last seven characters of that SHA-256 value.\n\n- CVE-2022-34919: The file upload wizard in Zengenti Contensis Classic before 15.2.1.79 does not correctly check that a user has authenticated. By uploading a crafted aspx file, it is possible to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n- CVE-2022-40494: NPS before v0.26.10 was discovered to contain an authentication bypass vulnerability via constantly generating and sending the Auth key and Timestamp parameters.\n\n- CVE-2021-41506: Xiaongmai AHB7008T-MH-V2, AHB7804R-ELS, AHB7804R-MH-V2, AHB7808R-MS-V2, AHB7808R-MS, AHB7808T-MS-V2, AHB7804R-LMS, HI3518_50H10L_S39 V4.02.R11.7601.Nat.Onvif.20170420, V4.02.R11.Nat.Onvif.20160422, V4.02.R11.7601.Nat.Onvif.20170424, V4.02.R11.Nat.Onvif.20170327, V4.02.R11.Nat.Onvif.20161205, V4.02.R11.Nat.20170301, V4.02.R12.Nat.OnvifS.20170727 is affected by a backdoor in the macGuarder and dvrHelper binaries of DVR/NVR/IP camera firmware due to static root account credentials in the system.\n\n- CVE-2022-43917:  IBM WebSphere Application Server 8.5 and 9.0 traditional container uses weaker than expected cryptographic keys that could allow an attacker to decrypt sensitive information. This affects only the containerized version of WebSphere Application Server traditional. IBM X-Force ID: 241045. \n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-1390 (ChildOf)",

Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-10987: OS command injection in Wi-Fi router, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-10221: Template functionality in network configuration management tool allows OS command injection, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-9054: Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in username parameter, leading to OS command injection (CWE-78), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-1999-0067: Canonical example of OS command injection. CGI program does not neutralize \"|\" metacharacter when invoking a phonebook program.\n\n- CVE-2001-1246: Language interpreter's mail function accepts another argument that is concatenated to a string used in a dangerous popen() call. Since there is no neutralization of this argument, both OS Command Injection (CWE-78) and Argument Injection (CWE-88) are possible.\n\n- CVE-2002-0061: Web server allows command execution using \"|\" (pipe) character.\n\n- CVE-2003-0041: FTP client does not filter \"|\" from filenames returned by the server, allowing for OS command injection.\n\n- CVE-2008-2575: Shell metacharacters in a filename in a ZIP archive\n\n- CVE-2002-1898: Shell metacharacters in a telnet:// link are not properly handled when the launching application processes the link.\n\n- CVE-2008-4304: OS command injection through environment variable.\n\n- CVE-2008-4796: OS command injection through https:// URLs\n\n- CVE-2007-3572: Chain: incomplete denylist for OS command injection\n\n- CVE-2012-1988: Product allows remote users to execute arbitrary commands by creating a file whose pathname contains shell metacharacters.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-19907: A command injection vulnerability in the sandcat plugin of Caldera 2.3.1 and earlier allows authenticated attackers to execute any command or service.\n\n- CVE-2020-25206: The web console for Mimosa B5, B5c, and C5x firmware through 2.8.0.2 allows authenticated command injection in the Throughput, WANStats, PhyStats, and QosStats API classes. An attacker with access to a web console account may execute operating system commands on affected devices by sending crafted POST requests to the affected endpoints (/core/api/calls/Throughput.php, /core/api/calls/WANStats.php, /core/api/calls/PhyStats.php, /core/api/calls/QosStats.php). This results in the complete takeover of the vulnerable device. This vulnerability does not occur in the older 1.5.x firmware versions.\n\n- CVE-2020-25367: A command injection vulnerability was discovered in the HNAP1 protocol in D-Link DIR-823G devices with firmware V1.0.2B05.

This is fixed in version 1.4.0.\n\n- CVE-2020-5322: Dell EMC OpenManage Enterprise-Modular (OME-M) versions prior to 1.10.00 contain a command injection vulnerability. A remote authenticated malicious user with high privileges could potentially exploit the vulnerability to execute arbitrary shell commands on the affected system.\n\n- CVE-2020-7389: Sage X3 System CHAINE Variable Script Command Injection. An authenticated user with developer access can pass OS commands via this variable used by the web application. Note, this developer configuration should not be deployed in production.\n\n- CVE-2020-7879: This issue was discovered when the ipTIME C200 IP Camera was synchronized with the ipTIME NAS. It is necessary to extract value for ipTIME IP camera because the ipTIME NAS send ans setCookie('[COOKIE]') . The value is transferred to the --header option in wget binary, and there is no validation check. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute remote command.\n\n- CVE-2021-0218: A command injection vulnerability in the license-check daemon of Juniper Networks Junos OS that may allow a locally authenticated attacker with low privileges to execute commands with root privilege. license-check is a daemon used to manage licenses in Junos OS. To update licenses, a user executes the command 'request system license update' via the CLI. An attacker with access to this CLI command may be able to exploit the vulnerability. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S9; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S12, 17.4R3-S3; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S11; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S6; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S4; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R3-S6; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R1-S6, 19.1R2-S2, 19.1R3-S3; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3-S1; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S5, 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S2, 19.4R3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S4, 20.1R2; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R1-S2, 20.2R2.\n\n- CVE-2021-0219: A command injection vulnerability in install package validation subsystem of Juniper Networks Junos OS that may allow a locally authenticated attacker with privileges to execute commands with root privilege. To validate a package in Junos before installation, an administrator executes the command 'request system software add validate-on-host' via the CLI. An attacker with access to this CLI command may be able to exploit this vulnerability. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: all versions prior to 17.3R3-S10; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S12, 17.4R3-S3; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S11; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2-S8, 18.2R3-S6; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S4; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S8, 18.4R2-S7, 18.4R3-S6; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R1-S6, 19.1R2-S2, 19.1R3-S3; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3-S1; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S5, 19.3R3-S1; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S2, 19.4R3-S1; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R1-S2, 20.2R2; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R1-S1, 20.3R2.\n\n- CVE-2021-1497: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco HyperFlex HX could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform command injection attacks against an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-1498: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco HyperFlex HX could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform command injection attacks against an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-1559: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco DNA Spaces Connector could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a command injection attack on an affected device. These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input sanitization when executing affected commands. A high-privileged attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities on a Cisco DNA Spaces Connector by injecting crafted input during command execution. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root within the Connector docker container.\n\n- CVE-2021-1584: A vulnerability in Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient restrictions during the execution of a specific CLI command. An attacker with administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability by performing a command injection attack on the vulnerable command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the underlying operating system as root.\n\n- CVE-2021-20017: A post-authenticated command injection vulnerability in SonicWall SMA100 allows an authenticated attacker to execute OS commands as a 'nobody' user. This vulnerability impacts SMA100 version 10.2.0.5 and earlier.\n\n- CVE-2021-21289: Mechanize is an open-source ruby library that makes automated web interaction easy. In Mechanize from version 2.0.0 and before version 2.7.7 there is a command injection vulnerability. Affected versions of mechanize allow for OS commands to be injected using several classes' methods which implicitly use Ruby's Kernel.open method. Exploitation is possible only if untrusted input is used as a local filename and passed to any of these calls: Mechanize::CookieJar#load, Mechanize::CookieJar#save_as, Mechanize#download, Mechanize::Download#save, Mechanize::File#save, and Mechanize::FileResponse#read_body. This is fixed in version 2.7.7.\n\n- CVE-2021-21315: The System Information Library for Node.JS (npm package \"systeminformation\") is an open source collection of functions to retrieve detailed hardware, system and OS information. In systeminformation before version 5.3.1 there is a command injection vulnerability. Problem was fixed in version 5.3.1. As a workaround instead of upgrading, be sure to check or sanitize service parameters that are passed to si.inetLatency(), si.inetChecksite(), si.services(), si.processLoad() ... do only allow strings, reject any arrays. String sanitation works as expected.\n\n- CVE-2021-21388: systeminformation is an open source system and OS information library for node.js. A command injection vulnerability has been discovered in versions of systeminformation prior to 5.6.4. The issue has been fixed with a parameter check on user input. Please upgrade to version >= 5.6.4. If you cannot upgrade, be sure to check or sanitize service parameters that are passed to si.inetLatency(), si.inetChecksite(), si.services(), si.processLoad() and other commands. Only allow strings, reject any arrays. String sanitation works as expected.\n\n- CVE-2021-21412: Potential for arbitrary code execution in npm package @thi.ng/egf `#gpg`-tagged property values (only if `decrypt: true` option is enabled). PR with patch has been submitted and will has been released as of v0.4.0 By default the EGF parse functions do NOT attempt to decrypt values (since GPG only available in non-browser env). However, if GPG encrypted values are used/required: 1. Perform a regex search for `#gpg`-tagged values in the EGF source file/string and check for backtick (\\\\`) chars in the encrypted value string 2. Replace/remove them or skip parsing if present.\n\n- CVE-2021-24033: react-dev-utils prior to v11.0.4 exposes a function, getProcessForPort, where an input argument is concatenated into a command string to be executed. This function is typically used from react-scripts (in Create React App projects), where the usage is safe. Only when this function is manually invoked with user-provided values (ie: by custom code) is there the potential for command injection. If you're consuming it from react-scripts then this issue does not affect you.\n\n- CVE-2021-26543: The \"gitDiff\" function in Wayfair git-parse <=1.0.4 has a command injection vulnerability.

An issue in versions 1.4.0 to 1.5.1 allows for exposure of the home directory on Unix systems when using Bash with the `escape` or `escapeAll` functions from the _shescape_ API with the `interpolation` option set to `true`. Other tested shells, Dash and Zsh, are not affected. Depending on how the output of _shescape_ is used, directory traversal may be possible in the application using _shescape_. The issue was patched in version 1.5.1. As a workaround, manually escape all instances of the tilde character (`~`) using `arg.replace(/~/g, \"\\\\\\\\~\")`.\n\n- CVE-2022-33891: The Apache Spark UI offers the possibility to enable ACLs via the configuration option spark.acls.enable. With an authentication filter, this checks whether a user has access permissions to view or modify the application. If ACLs are enabled, a code path in HttpSecurityFilter can allow someone to perform impersonation by providing an arbitrary user name. A malicious user might then be able to reach a permission check function that will ultimately build a Unix shell command based on their input, and execute it. This will result in arbitrary shell command execution as the user Spark is currently running as. This affects Apache Spark versions 3.0.3 and earlier, versions 3.1.1 to 3.1.2, and versions 3.2.0 to 3.2.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-27561: Yealink Device Management (DM) 3.6.0.20 allows command injection as root via the /sm/api/v1/firewall/zone/services URI, without authentication.\n\n- CVE-2022-26258: D-Link DIR-820L 1.05B03 was discovered to contain remote command execution (RCE) vulnerability via HTTP POST to get set ccp.\n\n- CVE-2022-28810: Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus before build 6122 allows a remote authenticated administrator to execute arbitrary operating OS commands as SYSTEM via the policy custom script feature.

In affected versions a command injection vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on a server running Cacti, if a specific data source was selected for any monitored device. The vulnerability resides in the `remote_agent.php` file. This file can be accessed without authentication. This function retrieves the IP address of the client via `get_client_addr` and resolves this IP address to the corresponding hostname via `gethostbyaddr`. After this, it is verified that an entry within the `poller` table exists, where the hostname corresponds to the resolved hostname. If such an entry was found, the function returns `true` and the client is authorized. This authorization can be bypassed due to the implementation of the `get_client_addr` function. The function is defined in the file `lib/functions.php` and checks serval `$_SERVER` variables to determine the IP address of the client. The variables beginning with `HTTP_` can be arbitrarily set by an attacker. Since there is a default entry in the `poller` table with the hostname of the server running Cacti, an attacker can bypass the authentication e.g. by providing the header `Forwarded-For: <TARGETIP>`. This way the function `get_client_addr` returns the IP address of the server running Cacti. The following call to `gethostbyaddr` will resolve this IP address to the hostname of the server, which will pass the `poller` hostname check because of the default entry. After the authorization of the `remote_agent.php` file is bypassed, an attacker can trigger different actions. One of these actions is called `polldata`. The called function `poll_for_data` retrieves a few request parameters and loads the corresponding `poller_item` entries from the database. If the `action` of a `poller_item` equals `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP`, the function `proc_open` is used to execute a PHP script. The attacker-controlled parameter `$poller_id` is retrieved via the function `get_nfilter_request_var`, which allows arbitrary strings. This variable is later inserted into the string passed to `proc_open`, which leads to a command injection vulnerability. By e.g. providing the `poller_id=;id` the `id` command is executed. In order to reach the vulnerable call, the attacker must provide a `host_id` and `local_data_id`, where the `action` of the corresponding `poller_item` is set to `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP`. Both of these ids (`host_id` and `local_data_id`) can easily be bruteforced. The only requirement is that a `poller_item` with an `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP` action exists. This is very likely on a productive instance because this action is added by some predefined templates like `Device - Uptime` or `Device - Polling Time`. This command injection vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary commands if a `poller_item` with the `action` type `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP` (`2`) is configured. The authorization bypass should be prevented by not allowing an attacker to make `get_client_addr` (file `lib/functions.php`) return an arbitrary IP address. This could be done by not honoring the `HTTP_...` `$_SERVER` variables. If these should be kept for compatibility reasons it should at least be prevented to fake the IP address of the server running Cacti. This vulnerability has been addressed in both the 1.2.x and 1.3.x release branches with `1.2.23` being the first release containing the patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-42759: A violation of secure design principles in Fortinet Meru AP version 8.6.1 and below, version 8.5.5 and below allows attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands via crafted cli commands.\n\n- CVE-2021-43073: A improper neutralization of special elements used in an os command ('os command injection') in Fortinet FortiWeb version 6.4.1 and 6.4.0, version 6.3.15 and below, version 6.2.6 and below allows attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands via crafted HTTP requests.\n\n- CVE-2021-43075: A improper neutralization of special elements used in an os command ('os command injection') in Fortinet FortiWLM version 8.6.2 and below, version 8.5.2 and below, version 8.4.2 and below, version 8.3.2 and below allows attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands via crafted HTTP requests to the alarm dashboard and controller config handlers.\n\n- CVE-2021-43928: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command ('OS Command Injection') vulnerability in mail sending and receiving component in Synology Mail Station before 20211105-10315 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary commands via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2021-44171: A improper neutralization of special elements used in an os command ('os command injection') in Fortinet FortiOS version 6.0.0 through 6.0.14, FortiOS version 6.2.0 through 6.2.10, FortiOS version 6.4.0 through 6.4.8, FortiOS version 7.0.0 through 7.0.3 allows attacker to execute privileged commands on a linked FortiSwitch via diagnostic CLI commands.\n\n- CVE-2022-1703: Improper neutralization of special elements in the SonicWall SSL-VPN SMA100 series management interface allows a remote authenticated attacker to inject OS Commands which potentially leads to remote command execution vulnerability or denial of service (DoS) attack.\n\n- CVE-2022-22273: Improper neutralization of Special Elements leading to OS Command Injection vulnerability impacting end-of-life Secure Remote Access (SRA) products and older firmware versions of Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 series products, specifically the SRA appliances running all 8.x, 9.0.0.5-19sv and earlier versions and Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 series products running older firmware 9.0.0.9-26sv and earlier versions\n\n- CVE-2022-22301: An improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS Command vulnerability [CWE-78] in FortiAP-C console 5.4.0 through 5.4.3, 5.2.0 through 5.2.1 may allow an authenticated attacker to execute unauthorized commands by running CLI commands with specifically crafted arguments.\n\n- CVE-2022-22684: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command ('OS Command Injection') vulnerability in task management component in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.4-25553 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary commands via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2022-2185: A critical issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 14.0 prior to 14.10.5, 15.0 prior to 15.0.4, and 15.1 prior to 15.1.1 where an authenticated user authorized to import projects could import a maliciously crafted project leading to remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-4257: A vulnerability was found in C-DATA Web Management System.

This vulnerability may be triggered when running the the CLI tool directly, or when running a scan with one of the IDE plugins that invoke the Snyk CLI. Successful exploitation of this issue would likely require some level of social engineering - to coerce an untrusted project to be downloaded and analyzed via the Snyk CLI or opened in an IDE where a Snyk IDE plugin is installed and enabled. Additionally, if the IDE has a Trust feature then the target folder must be marked as \u2018trusted\u2019 in order to be vulnerable. **NOTE:** This issue is independent of the one reported in [CVE-2022-40764](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SNYK-3037342), and upgrading to a fixed version for this addresses that issue as well.

A successful exploit allows attackers to run arbitrary commands on the host system where the Snyk CLI is installed by passing in crafted command line flags. In order to exploit this vulnerability, a user would have to execute the snyk test command on untrusted files. In most cases, an attacker positioned to control the command line arguments to the Snyk CLI would already be positioned to execute arbitrary commands. However, this could be abused in specific scenarios, such as continuous integration pipelines, where developers can control the arguments passed to the Snyk CLI to leverage this component as part of a wider attack against an integration/build pipeline. This issue has been addressed in the latest Snyk Docker images available at https://hub.docker.com/r/snyk/snyk as of 2022-11-29. Images downloaded and built prior to that date should be updated.

Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:\n\n```\n\t\tInbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.\n\t\tOutbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.\n```\nIn the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\n\nThe Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\n",

In this variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. It can also be difficult for the administrator to detect.\n\n  - Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded credentials for connecting to that component. This variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password that can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product.\n\n",
