  "description": "Rustix is a set of safe Rust bindings to POSIX-ish APIs. When using `rustixfsDir` using the `linux_raw` backend, its possible for the iterator to get stuck when an IO error is encountered. Combined with a **memory over-allocation** issue in `rustixfsDirread_more`, this can cause quick and unbounded memory explosion (gigabytes in a few seconds if used on a hot path) and eventually lead to an OOM crash of the application. The symptoms were initially discovered in https//github.com/imsnif/bandwhich/issues/284. That post has lots of details of our investigation. Full details can be read on the GHSA-c827-hfw6-qwvm repo advisory. If a program tries to access a directory with its file descriptor after the file has been unlinked (or any other action that leaves the `Dir` iterator in the stuck state), and the implementation does not break after seeing an error, it can cause a memory explosion. As an example, Linuxs various virtual file systems (e.g. `/proc`, `/sys`) can contain directories that spontaneously pop in and out of existence. Attempting to iterate over them using `rustixfsDir` directly or indirectly (e.g. with the `procfs` crate) can trigger this fault condition if the implementation decides to continue on errors. An attacker knowledgeable about the implementation details of a vulnerable target can therefore try to trigger this fault condition via any one or a combination of several available APIs. If successful, the application host will quickly run out of m",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from two combined issues in the `rustix` crate, specifically when using the `linux_raw` backend for directory iteration:\n1.  **Stuck Iterator:** The `rustix::fs::Dir` iterator can get stuck in an infinite loop when an I/O error is encountered, failing to halt after the error occurs.\n2.  **Memory Over-allocation:** The `Dir::read_more` function incorrectly grows the read buffer (`self.buf`) each time it's called. It uses `self.buf.capacity()` instead of `self.buf.len()` when resizing, leading to unbounded memory growth.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n-   Incorrect buffer resizing logic in `Dir::read_more`.\n-   The iterator's failure to halt upon encountering an I/O error.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can trigger a rapid and unbounded memory explosion by causing the `rustix::fs::Dir` iterator to get stuck. This leads to the application consuming excessive memory and eventually being terminated by the operating system's OOM killer.\n-   **Application Crash:** The uncontrolled memory growth results in an out-of-memory (OOM) condition, causing the application to crash.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n-   Accessing a directory with its file descriptor after the directory has been unlinked.\n-   Iterating over virtual file systems (e.g., `/proc`, `/sys`) where directories can appear and disappear.\n-   Any scenario where the `rustix::fs::Dir` iterator encounters an I/O error and continues iterating.\n-   Specifically, `bandwhich` uses `procfs` which internally uses `rustix` to iterate over file descriptors. This path was used to identify and reproduce the issue.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n-   The attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable code path. This could involve:\n    -   Manipulating the file system to cause I/O errors during directory iteration.\n    -   Interacting with virtual file systems that might cause the directory iterator to encounter transient errors.\n-  Low privileges are enough to trigger the vulnerability, although the impact of the denial of service attack will likely affect the whole system.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n-   The vulnerability was initially discovered in the `bandwhich` application and was tracked down to `rustix` crate.\n-   The issue was diagnosed by analyzing memory usage and backtraces using tools like `heaptrack` and `flamegraph`.\n-   The fix involves modifying `Dir::read_more` to use `self.buf.len()` instead of `self.buf.capacity()` when resizing the buffer, and ensuring that the iterator halts on I/O errors.\n-   Patched versions are ~0.35.15, ~0.36.16, ~0.37.25, ~0.38.19\n-   The issue was identified by `konnorandrews`.\n-   The CVSS score was rated as moderate with a base score of 6.5\n-   CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H",

The application allocates memory without proper limits, leading to a denial-of-service. |\n| CWE-789 | Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value | 0.8 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The allocated memory is based on a size value that could be excessively large, exacerbating the resource exhaustion. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-770, which describes the **allocation of resources without limits or throttling**. CWE-789, **memory allocation with excessive size value**, is a variant of CWE-770, and it describes more specifically that the size of the allocated memory is excessive. The relationship is hierarchical: CWE-789 is a child of CWE-770. Choosing CWE-770 as the primary weakness and CWE-789 as the secondary weakness provides a more complete picture of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    \n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe789 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper allocation of memory** without limits (CWE-770).
