  "query": "A vulnerability classified as critical was found in symisc UnQLite up to 957c377cb691a4f617db9aba5cc46d90425071e2. This vulnerability affects the function jx9MemObjStore of the file /data/src/benchmarks/unqlite/unqlite.c. The manipulation leads to heap-based buffer overflow. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Continious delivery with rolling releases is used by this product. Therefore, no version details of affected nor updated releases are available.",
