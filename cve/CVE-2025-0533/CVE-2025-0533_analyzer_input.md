## Analysis of CVE-2025-0533 Content

Based on the provided content, specifically the GitHub issue report, this content **IS RELATED** to a vulnerability. It provides details exceeding the placeholder CVE description.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient user input validation of the 'uname' parameter in the `/Code/sc_login.php` file.  Malicious SQL queries can be injected directly into SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection (boolean-based blind and time-based blind)

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   Comprehensive system control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The 'uname' parameter in a POST request to `/Code/sc_login.php` is vulnerable.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.
*   Knowledge of SQL injection techniques and tools (like `sqlmap`) is beneficial.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
*   Implement strict input validation and filtering.
*   Minimize database user permissions.
*   Conduct regular security audits.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Product:** Campaign Management System Platform for Women PHP Project V1.0
*   **Vulnerable File:** `/Code/sc_login.php`
*   **Payload Examples:** Provided for both boolean-based blind and time-based blind SQL injection.
*   **Software Link:**  [https://1000projects.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Compaign-management-platform-for-women.7z](https://1000projects.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Compaign-management-platform-for-women.7z)
