  "description": "A vulnerability was found in wfh45678 Radar up to 1.0.8 and classified as critical. This issue affects some unknown processing of the component Interface Handler. The manipulation with the input /../ leads to authorization bypass. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This appears not to be a **path traversal** weakness. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability is due to an authorization bypass in the `wfh45678 Radar` application. Specifically, the application fails to properly restrict access to its interfaces, allowing unauthenticated users to access any interface by manipulating the URL with `/../`.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Authentication Bypass:** The core issue is the lack of proper authentication checks, which allows unauthorized access to application functionalities.\n- **Path Traversal:** Although the vulnerability is described as not being a path traversal issue, the manipulation of the URL with `/../` suggests that path traversal-like techniques are being used to bypass authorization checks.\n- **Insufficient Access Control:** The application fails to enforce proper access controls, allowing unauthenticated requests to reach protected resources.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Confidentiality:** Unauthorized access could expose sensitive data managed by the Radar application.\n- **Integrity:** Attackers might be able to modify data within the application, leading to incorrect risk assessment.\n- **Availability:** The vulnerability could be exploited to disrupt the services, potentially rendering the risk engine unavailable.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Remote:** The attack can be initiated remotely.\n- **Unauthenticated:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the Radar application.\n- **No Special Skills:** The exploit is considered easy to execute.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- The vulnerability can be triggered by adding `/../` to the URL when accessing a specific endpoint, e.g., `/services/v1/model/list` becomes `/services/v1/model/list/../`.\n- The vulnerability affects versions of Radar up to and including 1.0.8.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- A proof-of-concept exploit is publicly available on GitHub.\n- The vendor was notified but did not respond.\n- The vulnerability is classified as critical.\n- The CWE associated with this vulnerability is CWE-639, relating to authorization bypass, as well as CWE-285 and CWE-266.",

While the vulnerability description mentions that this is not a **path traversal** issue, the fact that the input `/../` leads to an **authorization bypass** suggests a potential secondary weakness related to **path traversal**, which is reflected in the selection of CWE-22. CWE-306 is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), and CWE-22 can lead to CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path). The analysis focuses on identifying the root cause (missing authentication) and any contributing factors (path manipulation), leading to the selection of these two CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe22 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe73\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe22 secondary\n    class cwe287,cwe73 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** (CWE-306). The ability to manipulate the path using `/../` (potentially CWE-22) allows bypassing **authorization checks**, ultimately leading to unauthorized access.\n  - CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function (Root Cause)\n  - CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') (Contributing Factor)\n  - Authorization Bypass (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary focus is on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability based on the provided evidence. The description highlights an **authorization bypass** due to the manipulation of input `/../`. The analysis determined that the **missing authentication** is the main reason an attacker can bypass **authorization checks**.\n\nThe evidence supporting this includes:\n- \"The manipulation with the input /../ leads to authorization bypass.\"\n- \"The vulnerability is due to an authorization bypass in the `wfh45678 Radar` application. Specifically, the application fails to properly restrict access to its interfaces, allowing unauthenticated users to access any interface by manipulating the URL with `/../`.\"\n- \"Authentication Bypass: The core issue is the lack of proper authentication checks, which allows unauthorized access to application functionalities.\"\n\nCWE-306 is selected as the primary CWE because the application lacks authentication for critical functions. Although the vulnerability description mentions it \"appears not to be a path traversal weakness,\" the ability to manipulate the URL with `/../` suggests a path traversal-like technique is used to bypass authorization checks. Therefore, CWE-22 is included as a secondary CWE.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity because they directly represent the **missing authentication** and the potential contributing factor of **path manipulation**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n*This CWE was considered because the vulnerability involves manipulation of paths, but it focuses on path equivalence issues, not the lack of authentication.
