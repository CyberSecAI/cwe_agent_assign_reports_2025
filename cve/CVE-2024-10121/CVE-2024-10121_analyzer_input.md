# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-10121

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in wfh45678 Radar up to 1.0.8 and classified as critical. This issue affects some unknown processing of the component Interface Handler. The manipulation with the input /../ leads to authorization bypass. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This appears not to be a **path traversal** weakness. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **path traversal**
- **impact:** authorization bypass
- **vector:** manipulation with input /../
- **product:** wfh45678 Radar
- **version:** up to 1.0.8
- **component:** Interface Handler

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to an authorization bypass in the `wfh45678 Radar` application. Specifically, the application fails to properly restrict access to its interfaces, allowing unauthenticated users to access any interface by manipulating the URL with `/../`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The core issue is the lack of proper authentication checks, which allows unauthorized access to application functionalities.
- **Path Traversal:** Although the vulnerability is described as not being a path traversal issue, the manipulation of the URL with `/../` suggests that path traversal-like techniques are being used to bypass authorization checks.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The application fails to enforce proper access controls, allowing unauthenticated requests to reach protected resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** Unauthorized access could expose sensitive data managed by the Radar application.
- **Integrity:** Attackers might be able to modify data within the application, leading to incorrect risk assessment.
- **Availability:** The vulnerability could be exploited to disrupt the services, potentially rendering the risk engine unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack can be initiated remotely.
- **Unauthenticated:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the Radar application.
- **No Special Skills:** The exploit is considered easy to execute.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by adding `/../` to the URL when accessing a specific endpoint, e.g., `/services/v1/model/list` becomes `/services/v1/model/list/../`.
- The vulnerability affects versions of Radar up to and including 1.0.8.

**Additional Notes:**
- A proof-of-concept exploit is publicly available on GitHub.
- The vendor was notified but did not respond.
- The vulnerability is classified as critical.
- The CWE associated with this vulnerability is CWE-639, relating to authorization bypass, as well as CWE-285 and CWE-266.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| No identity check (no login)                               | CWE-306        |
| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
