## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in code-projects Job Recruitment 1.0. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /activation.php. The manipulation of the argument e_hash leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** code-projects Job Recruitment
- **version:** 1
- **component:** /activation.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `activation.php` file of the "Job Recruitment System" application. The `$e_hash` parameter, which is received via a GET request, is not properly sanitized or filtered before being used in a SQL query. This allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection vulnerability. The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially exfiltrating sensitive information including user credentials and other confidential data.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Through SQL injection, attackers can inject malicious code into the database and use `outfile` to write a PHP shell to the server. This enables them to execute arbitrary code on the server and fully compromise the system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is the `e_hash` parameter within a GET request to `activation.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is present in the foreground login portal, meaning no prior authentication is needed.
*   **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL injection techniques.

**Summary:**

The content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the `activation.php` file of a Job Recruitment System. It details how an attacker can exploit the unsanitized `e_hash` parameter to perform SQL injection attacks. The impact of this vulnerability ranges from data exfiltration to complete system compromise via remote code execution. The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates how to inject a PHP shell via SQL injection, gaining RCE, and how to extract data using sqlmap.
