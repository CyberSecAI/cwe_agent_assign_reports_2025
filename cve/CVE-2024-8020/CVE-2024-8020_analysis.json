This issue occurs due to **improper handling of unexpected state values**, which results in the server shutting down.",

The evidence is drawn directly from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section. While the impact is a denial of service, the root cause is the handling of the unexpected state, making CWE-703 the most appropriate.\n\nCWE-755 was considered but deemed too specific, as the description only mentions \"improper handling\" without further detail, while CWE-703 is a broader category that fits better. CWE-400 describes uncontrolled resource consumption, which is a typical result of a denial of service, but does not describe the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   **CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions**: This CWE's description aligns with the vulnerability's root cause. The description states the server shuts down because of the **improper handling**.\n*   **CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions**: This CWE is more specific than CWE-703 but still aligns with the description. It could be applicable if the exceptional condition can be identified.\n*   **CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**: This CWE describes the impact, but not the root cause.\n\nThe evidence from the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:\n*   **rootcause:** **improper handling of unexpected state values**\n\nI am selecting CWE-703 because it directly relates to the **improper handling of unexpected state values**, which is the root cause of the vulnerability.",
