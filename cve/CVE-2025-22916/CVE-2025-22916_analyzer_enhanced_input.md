## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The content from github.com_3108b969_20250624_132315.html details a stack overflow vulnerability discovered in the RE11S_1.11 router. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack overflow in the `formPPPoESetup` function within the `webs` file.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack overflow.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**  The stack overflow can be triggered by manipulating the `pppUserName` key value. While command injection is prevented by `sprintf` truncation, a stack overflow is still possible.
*   **Attack vectors:** Providing a long string as the value for the `pppUserName` key.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network access to the router's web interface.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** Not specified in the provided content.
*   **Additional details:** The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) Python script (`poc.py`) to exploit the vulnerability and screenshots demonstrating the stack overflow. The script sends a POST request to `http://192.168.9.2/goform/formPPPoESetup` with a long string as the `pppUserName` value.

The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including a PoC and visual evidence of the vulnerability.
