The retriever results suggest several CWEs related to authorization and privilege management.\n\nInitially, I considered CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) due to its broad applicability to access control issues. However, the description specifies that the problem lies in **improper permission and access controls**, which suggests a flaw in the authorization process rather than a complete lack of access control.\n\nGiven the guidance and the vulnerability's description, CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is chosen as the primary CWE. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is considered a secondary CWE to indicate that the authorization process exists but is flawed.\n\nThe evidence relies on the description \"**improper permission and access controls**\". The selection of CWE-285 and CWE-863 are at the optimal level of specificity, as they capture the essence of the authorization failure without being overly generic.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1218.00\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead.
