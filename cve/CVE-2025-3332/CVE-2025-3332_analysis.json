  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-3332 Content\n\nThis content **relates** to a SQL injection vulnerability. It provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is insufficient user input validation of the 'menu' parameter in the `/admin/menu_save.php` file.  The application directly uses the parameter in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering\n*   System control\n*   Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is exploitable via the 'menu' parameter in a POST request to `/admin/menu_save.php`.\n*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.\n*   **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.\n*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the minimum necessary privileges.\n*   **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.\n\n**Payload Examples:**\n\nThe content includes example payloads for error-based and time-based blind SQL injection attacks, demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Affected Product:** Restaurant Management System Project in PHP with Source Code\n*   **Vendor Homepage:** [https://itsourcecode.com/free-projects/php-project/online-restaurant-management-system-project-in-php-with-source-code/](https://itsourcecode.com/free-projects/php-project/online-restaurant-management-system-project-in-php-with-source-code/)\n*   **Vulnerable File:** `/admin/menu_save.php`\n*   **Version:** V1.0\n*   **Software Link:** [https://itsourcecode.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/altonsystem.zip](https://itsourcecode.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/altonsystem.zip)",

There are no child CWEs to consider for greater specificity. No chain relationships were identified as critical to this single weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is simple:\n1.  **Improper input validation** of the `menu` parameter in `/admin/menu_save.php` leads to...\n2.  **SQL Injection** (CWE-89)\n\nThe root cause is the lack of proper input validation, which directly leads to the SQL injection vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based strongly on the provided evidence. The vulnerability description clearly states the presence of **SQL Injection** due to the manipulation of the `menu` argument. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating that the root cause is insufficient user input validation of the 'menu' parameter, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the primary candidate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the **SQL Injection** vulnerability and is a Base level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
