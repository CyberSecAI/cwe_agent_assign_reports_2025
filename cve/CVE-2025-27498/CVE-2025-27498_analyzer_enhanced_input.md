## Vulnerability Description
aes-gcm is a pure Rust implementation of the AES-GCM. In decrypt_in_place_detached, the decrypted ciphertext (which is the correct ciphertext) is exposed even if the tag is incorrect. This is because in decrypt_inplace in asconcore.rs, tag verification causes an error to be returned with the plaintext contents still in buffer. The vulnerability is fixed in 0.4.3.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** ['decrypt_inplace_detached', 'decrypt_in_place_detached']
- **vector:** incorrect tag
- **impact:** expose decrypted ciphertext

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-27498 based on provided content

**1. Verification:**

The content directly relates to CVE-2025-27498 as it explicitly states the CVE ID and provides a detailed security advisory for the vulnerability.

**2. Extracted Information:**

* **Root cause of vulnerability:**
  The vulnerability stems from the `decrypt_in_place_detached` function in `asconcore.rs` exposing the decrypted ciphertext even when the tag verification fails. This is similar to a previously identified vulnerability (GHSA-423w-p2w9-r7vq).

* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Improper handling of tag verification failure in decryption.
  - Exposure of plaintext data even on authentication failure.
  - CWE-347: Improper Authentication.

* **Impact of exploitation:**
  - Unauthenticated plaintext exposure.
  - Potential for chosen ciphertext attacks (CCAs).

* **Attack vectors:**
  - An attacker can provide an invalid tag during decryption.
  - The attacker can then read the decrypted plaintext, even though authentication failed.

* **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - Local access to the system.
  - Ability to provide a crafted input with an incorrect tag.
  - Active user interaction is required.

* **Mitigation or fix:**
  - Upgrade to version 0.4.3 or later of the `ascon_aead` crate.
  - The fix involves zeroizing the buffer during decryption on a failed tag check (as seen in the commit d1d749b).

* **CVSS Score:**
  - CVSS v4: 5.6/10
  - Attack Vector: Local
  - Attack Complexity: High
  - Attack Requirements: None
  - Privileges Required: None
  - User interaction: Active
  - Confidentiality: Low
  - Integrity: High
  - Availability: None

**3. Additional Details:**

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description would likely contain, including:

*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability.
*   Specific file and line numbers related to the vulnerability.
*   Detailed CVSS metrics.
*   A link to the related commit that fixes the issue.
*   A reference to a similar previous vulnerability (GHSA-423w-p2w9-r7vq).
