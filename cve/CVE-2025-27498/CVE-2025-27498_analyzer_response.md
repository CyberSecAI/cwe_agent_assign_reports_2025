# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-27498

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-316 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory | 0.75 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE. |
| CWE-347 | Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature | 0.65 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-316 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory which is a Variant. CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature is a Base CWE and a secondary candidate because the root cause is the plaintext contents are still in buffer even when the tag verification fails and exposure of plaintext data even on authentication failure. There aren't strong relationships to influence the selection.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with the **improper handling of tag verification failure** during decryption, leading to the decrypted ciphertext being exposed even when the tag is incorrect. This results in the **cleartext storage of sensitive information in memory** and ultimately exposes the plaintext data even on authentication failure.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability and the resulting impact. The key evidence is that "the decrypted ciphertext (which is the correct ciphertext) is exposed even if the tag is incorrect" and "tag verification causes an error to be returned with the plaintext contents still in buffer". This indicates a problem with how the decrypted data is handled after the tag verification fails. The retriever results suggested multiple CWEs, but after reviewing the vulnerability description and the complete CWE specifications, CWE-316 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory was selected as the primary CWE because the decrypted ciphertext is exposed even if the tag is incorrect. CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature was considered as a secondary CWE because it is related to tag verification failure in decryption. However, the primary issue is that the plaintext data is still present in the buffer after the verification fails, which is more accurately described by CWE-316.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.
