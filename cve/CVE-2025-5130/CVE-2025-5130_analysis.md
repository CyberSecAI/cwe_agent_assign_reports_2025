# Analysis for CVE-2025-5130

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-434 | Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE - Directly reflects the **unrestricted upload** vulnerability |
| CWE-646 | Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE - Possible contributing factor to the **unrestricted upload** |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the CWE selection is that CWE-434 [CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type] directly addresses the **unrestricted upload** vulnerability described. CWE-646 [CWE-646: Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File] is a more specific variant that could contribute to the root cause. Both are base or variant level, which are preferred.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **unrestricted upload** (**CWE-434**) leading to potential execution of malicious code. **CWE-646** may be a contributing factor by allowing dangerous file types to be uploaded based on filename or extension.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary CWE is **CWE-434** because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions "**unrestricted upload**". This aligns with the CWE's definition of allowing the upload of dangerous file types. The retriever results also support **CWE-434** as a strong candidate.

The selection is further strengthened by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which mentions:

*   Lack of file type validation.
*   Lack of file content scanning for malicious code.
*   JSP parsing enabled, allowing execution of uploaded scripts.

These points directly relate to the dangers described in **CWE-434**.

**CWE-646** is included as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability might involve relying on the file name or extension, which is a common weakness in file upload implementations.

The graph relationships did not significantly alter the decision, but they provided context on how **CWE-434** relates to other file handling and security issues. The abstraction levels of the selected CWEs are Base and Variant, which are preferred.

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
