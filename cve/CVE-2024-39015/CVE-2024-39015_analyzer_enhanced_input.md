## Vulnerability Description
cafebazaar hod v0.4.14 was discovered to contain a **prototype pollution** via the function request. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via injecting arbitrary properties.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **prototype pollution**
- **impact:** execute arbitrary code and denial of service
- **vector:** injecting arbitrary properties
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** cafebazaar hod
- **version:** v0.4.14
- **component:** request function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2024-39015.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to Prototype Pollution in the `request` function of the `@cafebazaar/hod` package.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `request` function is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.
- The function does not properly sanitize or validate user-provided input, allowing an attacker to inject a `__proto__` property.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can modify the built-in `Object.prototype`.
- This can lead to Denial of Service (DoS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, depending on the context and how the polluted prototype is used.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker calls the vulnerable `request` function with an argument containing the `__proto__` property.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to pass an argument with a `__proto__` property to the vulnerable `request` function.
- This could be through an API, user input, or other means of interaction with the vulnerable code.

**Additional details:**
- The affected package is `@cafebazaar/hod`, version 0.4.14.
- A proof-of-concept is provided demonstrating how to inject a `test` property to the `Object.prototype`.
