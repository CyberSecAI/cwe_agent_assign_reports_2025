  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds write in the `get_att_search_list` function within `subsys/bluetooth/host/sdp.c`. The function parses data elements without limiting the number it processes, which leads to an out-of-bounds write in subsequent accesses of the `filter` array.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Out-of-bounds write:** The `filter` array, which is used to store attribute IDs, can be written beyond its allocated size due to the lack of a limit on the parsed `data_elem` count.\n- **Stack overflow:** When the number of parsed `data_elem` exceeds the maximum allowed by the filter array size (`MAX_NUM_ATT_ID_FILTER`), a stack overflow occurs due to out-of-bounds writes.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Instability (crash):** The out-of-bounds write can corrupt the stack and lead to a crash of the affected system.\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By triggering the stack overflow, an attacker can render the system unusable, effectively causing a denial-of-service condition.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The attack vector is adjacent, meaning that the attacker must be within the physical or logical proximity of the vulnerable device to exploit the vulnerability. This likely refers to the Bluetooth communication range.\n- The attacker needs to send a specially crafted Bluetooth SDP (Service Discovery Protocol) request with a specific number of `data_elem`.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker must be within the communication range of the vulnerable device, as the vulnerability is triggered through Bluetooth communication.\n- No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.\n- No user interaction is needed.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The `MAX_NUM_ATT_ID_FILTER` is set to 10, which means more than 10 `data_elem` need to be included in the crafted packet.\n- The vulnerable function is called by `sdp_svc_att_req` or `sdp_svc_search_att_req`.\n- The `data_size` of each `data_elem` needs to be 2 or 4 to increment the `num_filter`. An example of such a data element could be `08 ff ff`\n\n**CVE ID:**\n- CVE-2024-6137\n\n**CWE:**\n- CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n- CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n- CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n\n**Patches:**\n- The fix is available in the provided pull request: [#75575](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/pull/75575)\n\nThis information aligns with and expands upon the typical information found in a CVE description.",

CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) is a variant of buffer overflow, which is a consequence of the **out-of-bounds write** when it occurs on the stack. CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is included as a potential consequence, although the description focuses on the write aspect. CWE-787 is a base CWE, while CWE-121 is a variant, providing more specificity. The relationships show a clear progression from the root cause (out-of-bounds write) to its impact (stack overflow).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe787 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe121\n    cwe787 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe125\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe121,cwe125 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the lack of input validation on the number of `data_elem` processed. This leads to an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787) when the number of elements exceeds the allocated size of the `filter` array. If this write occurs on the stack, it results in a stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121), potentially leading to a crash or denial-of-service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided CVE description and the extracted root cause and weakness information. The evidence strongly supports CWE-787 as the primary weakness, given the explicit mention of an **out-of-bounds write** in the `get_att_search_list` function. The description specifically states that the function parses data elements without limiting the number it processes, which leads to the out-of-bounds write. The relationship analysis reinforces this, as CWE-787 can precede buffer overflows.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the **out-of-bounds write** condition. CWE-121 is included as a secondary CWE because the **out-of-bounds write** leads to a stack overflow in this specific instance. CWE-125 is a potential consequence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
