  "description": "A vulnerability in the Dockerized version of mintplex-labs/anything-llm (latest, digest 1d9452da2b92) allows for a denial of service. Uploading an audio file with a very low sample rate causes the functionality responsible for transcribing it to crash the entire site instance. The issue arises from the localWhisper implementation, where resampling the audio file from 1 Hz to 16000 Hz quickly exceeds available memory, leading to the Docker instance being killed by the instance manager.",

  "reference_content": "The content relates to a commit in the `anything-llm` repository on GitHub. The commit message indicates \"Audio file validations\" and includes a patch to support wavfile parsing with sharp.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe commit addresses the need for audio file validations to prevent potential issues during processing.  Specifically, it appears to mitigate risks associated with invalid or malicious audio files.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nThe commit doesn't explicitly state a vulnerability, but implies that without validation, the system was susceptible to issues caused by invalid audio files (e.g., incorrect sample rate, excessive duration, or potentially malicious content).\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nWithout validation, processing invalid audio files could lead to crashes, errors, or potentially allow for denial-of-service attacks or other exploits.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nAn attacker could provide crafted audio files with invalid parameters (sample rate, duration, or content) to trigger errors or potentially exploit vulnerabilities in the audio processing pipeline.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nAn attacker would need to be able to provide audio files to the system, either directly or indirectly (e.g., through a file upload feature).\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\nThe commit introduces the following validations:\n*   **Sample Rate Check:** Ensures the audio file's sample rate is at least 4kHz.\n*   **Duration Check:** Limits the audio file duration to a maximum of 4 hours.\n*   **Sample Count Check:** Prevents memory issues by limiting the number of samples after upsampling.\n*   The commit also updates the `sharp` library to version 0.33.5 to support wavfile parsing.\n\nThe commit also includes changes to the `package.json` and `yarn.lock` files, indicating dependency updates, specifically to `sharp`.\n\nThis content provides more detail than the official CVE description would likely provide, as it details the specific validation checks implemented.",

CWE-789 **Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value**, is a Variant of CWE-770 and represents a more specific case. The vulnerability involves allocating memory without proper limits, which directly aligns with CWE-770. The excessive memory allocation due to a low sample rate audio file further specifies the issue, making CWE-789 a relevant secondary consideration.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    \n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe789 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper validation** of the audio file's sample rate, leading to **excessive memory allocation** due to resampling, and ultimately resulting in a **denial of service** as the Docker instance is killed.\n\nImproper Input -> Excessive Resource Allocation -> Denial of Service\nMissing Validation -> CWE-770 -> System Crash\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **lack of** input validation and the resulting resource exhaustion. The vulnerability description clearly states that uploading an audio file with a very low sample rate causes the transcription functionality to crash the entire site instance. The root cause is that the localWhisper implementation's resampling process exceeds available memory.\n\nThe evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary highlights the importance of audio file validations to prevent potential issues during processing. The mitigation involves implementing checks for sample rate, duration, and sample count.\n\nThe retriever results suggested several potential CWEs, including CWE-770 **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**, CWE-789 **Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value**, and CWE-1284 **Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input**.\n\nCWE-770 is chosen as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the core issue of allocating resources without proper limits, which leads to the denial of service. CWE-789 is considered a secondary CWE as it describes the specific scenario of allocating memory with an excessive size value due to the low sample rate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-770 and CWE-789 is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description, the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, and the retriever results.
