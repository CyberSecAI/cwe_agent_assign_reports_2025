This issue affects all previous Druid versions. When using the Druid management proxy, a request that has a specially crafted URL could be used to redirect the request to an arbitrary server instead. This has the potential for XSS or XSRF. The user is required to be authenticated for this exploit. The management proxy is enabled in Druids out-of-box configuration. It may be disabled to mitigate this vulnerability. If the management proxy is disabled, some web console features will not work properly, but core functionality is unaffected. Users are recommended to upgrade to Druid 31.0.2 or Druid 32.0.1, which fixes the issue.', key_phrases={'rootcause': ['Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation', 'URL redirection to untrusted site', 'improper input neutralization'], 'weakness': ['Server-Side Request Forgery', 'URL redirection'], 'impact': ['XSRF', 'XSS'], 'vector': 'specially crafted URL', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'Apache Druid', 'version': '', 'component': 'Druid management proxy'}, reference_content=\"Here's an analysis of the provided content related to CVE-2025-27888:\\n\\n**Analysis of content from www.openwall.com_63a41e01_20250624_162834.html:**\\n\\n*   **UNRELATED**\\n\\n**Analysis of content from www.openwall.com_ff0141a7_20250624_205252.html:**\\n\\n*   **UNRELATED**\\n\\n**Analysis of content from lists.openwall.net_ae5d8845_20250624_205252.html:**\\n\\n*   **UNRELATED**\\n\\n**Analysis of content from druid.apache.org_3036ad81_20250624_205252.html:**\\n\\n*   **UNRELATED**\\n\\n**Analysis of content from lists.apache.org_7139568f_20250624_162835.html:**\\n\\n*   **UNRELATED**\\n\\n**Analysis of content from the email:**\\n\\n*   **Relevant**\\n    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'), URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect').\\n    *   **Impact of exploitation:** Potential for XSS or XSRF.\\n    *   **Attack vectors:** A request with a specially crafted URL.\\n    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The user is required to be authenticated for this exploit.\\n    *   **Mitigation or fix:** Upgrade to Druid 31.0.2 or Druid 32.0.1.

This issue affects all previous Druid versions. When using the Druid management proxy, a request that has a specially crafted URL could be used to redirect the request to an arbitrary server instead. This has the potential for XSS or XSRF. The user is required to be authenticated for this exploit. The management proxy is enabled in Druids out-of-box configuration. It may be disabled to mitigate this vulnerability. If the management proxy is disabled, some web console features will not work properly, but core functionality is unaffected. Users are recommended to upgrade to Druid 31.0.2 or Druid 32.0.1, which fixes the issue.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
