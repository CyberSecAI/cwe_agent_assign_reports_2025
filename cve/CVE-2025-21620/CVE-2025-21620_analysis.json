  "description": "Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure defaults. When you send a request with the Authorization header to one domain, and the response asks to redirect to a different domain, Denosfetch() redirect handling creates a follow-up redirect request that keeps the original Authorization header, leaking its content to that second domain. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.1.2.",

It provides detailed information about a vulnerability in Deno.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nDeno's `fetch()` redirect handling does not drop the `Authorization` header when redirecting to a cross-origin domain. This leaks the authorization information to the second domain.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **CWE-200:** Improper Input Validation (specifically, not dropping sensitive headers during cross-origin redirects).\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nLeaking of `Authorization` headers to unintended domains during cross-origin redirects, potentially allowing unauthorized access or information disclosure.  Confidentiality is rated as High in the CVSS score.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Network: The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.\n*   An attacker can trigger a redirect from a domain where the user is authenticated (with an `Authorization` header) to a different domain they control.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   No privileges required.\n*   No user interaction required.\n*   The attacker needs to be able to control a server that can respond with a redirect to a different origin.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Patched in Deno versions >=2.1.2\n*   `deno_fetch` >=0.204.0\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The content includes a reproduction example using `Deno.serve` to demonstrate the vulnerability.\n*   It references the expected behavior according to the Fetch specification ([https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#ref-for-cors-non-wildcard-request-header-name](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#ref-for-cors-non-wildcard-request-header-name)).\n*   It includes a CVSS v3 score and breakdown of the metrics (7.5/10).\n*   It mentions that Deno does not enforce the same-origin policy and lacks a cookie jar, but notes this doesn't negate the need to protect against leaking authenticated data.\n*   Credits the reporter (@rexxars).",

While CWE-212 was initially considered, CWE-201 more accurately reflects the insertion of sensitive data into sent data (the Authorization header). The relationship with CWE-668 suggests the exposure of the sensitive information to an unintended sphere, which aligns with the cross-origin nature of the vulnerability. CWE-201 is a peer of CWE-209 (Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Error Message), which is a similar type of information leakage.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Error Message\"]\n    \n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe212 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe201 --|PEEROF| cwe209\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe668 secondary\n    class cwe212,cwe209 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the `fetch()` redirect handling in Deno **not dropping the Authorization header** when redirecting to a cross-origin domain. This **leads to the Authorization header content being leaked** to the second domain. The root cause is the **improper handling of sensitive information** during the redirect process, culminating in the **exposure of sensitive data**.\n  - Initial Flaw: Improper Handling of Redirects\n  - Weakness: Authorization Header Not Dropped\n  - Impact: Sensitive Information Leakage\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer), but the core issue is the insertion of the sensitive Authorization header into the redirected request, which is better captured by CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data). The **evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms this: \"Deno's `fetch()` redirect handling **does not drop the `Authorization` header** when redirecting to a cross-origin domain. This **leaks the authorization information** to the second domain.\" This aligns with CWE-201's description of constructing a command using externally-influenced input without properly neutralizing special elements.\n\nThe graph relationships reinforce this decision, highlighting that CWE-201 is a base-level CWE with direct relevance. While CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) could be considered a high-level classification, CWE-201 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the technical details of the vulnerability and align with the MITRE mapping guidance.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
