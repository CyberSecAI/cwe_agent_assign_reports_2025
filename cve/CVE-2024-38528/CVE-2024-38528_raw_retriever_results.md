# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-38528
## Query
nptd-rs is a tool for synchronizing your computers clock, implementing the NTP and NTS protocols. There is a missing limit for accepted NTS-KE connections. This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to crash ntpd-rs when an NTS-KE server is configured. Non NTS-KE server configurations, such as the default ntpd-rs configuration, are unaffected. This vulnerability has been patched in version 1.1.3.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'missing limit for accepted NTS-KE connections'
