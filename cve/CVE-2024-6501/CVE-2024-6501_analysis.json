  "description": "A flaw was found in NetworkManager. When a system running NetworkManager with DEBUG logs enabled and an interface eth1 configured with LLDP enabled, a malicious user could inject a malformed LLDP packet. NetworkManager would crash, leading to a denial of service.",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6501:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n- The vulnerability lies in how NetworkManager handles malformed Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) packets when DEBUG logging is enabled.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n- **Improper Input Handling:** NetworkManager fails to properly validate or sanitize incoming LLDP packets, particularly when debug logging is enabled. This allows for a crafted LLDP packet to trigger a crash.\n- **Denial of Service Vulnerability:** This is a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability, meaning the primary impact is to render the service unusable.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n-   A successful attack results in the crashing of the NetworkManager service.\n-   This crash leads to a denial of service, disrupting network connectivity on the affected system.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n- The attack vector involves injecting a malformed LLDP packet into the network where a vulnerable system running NetworkManager is present.\n- The system needs to have an interface configured with LLDP enabled (e.g., eth1 in the example).\n- DEBUG logging must be enabled in NetworkManager for the vulnerability to be triggered.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n- The attacker needs to be able to inject network packets into the same network segment as the vulnerable system.\n-   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious LLDP packets.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The provided data suggests this vulnerability is classified as having a \"Low\" severity.\n*   The vulnerability affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, as well as several derivative distributions of that, including CodeReady Linux Builder.\n*   A fix for this vulnerability has been released in RHSA-2024:9317.\n*   The bug report indicates that the vulnerability is triggered when DEBUG logging is enabled. This detail is not mentioned in the CVE description.\n* The bug report also contains links to related bug reports (2295736, 2295735), showing that the issue affects different Fedora versions as well.\n\nIn summary, CVE-2024-6501 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in NetworkManager that can be triggered by injecting a malformed LLDP packet when debug logging is enabled. It has a low severity rating and is addressed by a security update.",

While the vulnerability involves malformed LLDP packets, the description focuses on the lack of validation, making CWE-20 a reasonable initial choice. However, the impact of crashing the service suggests a potential link to resource consumption issues, leading to the consideration of CWE-400.

This lack of validation leads to a crash, which can be interpreted as an **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400) issue, ultimately resulting in a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The CVE description and reference links highlight that NetworkManager fails to properly validate malformed LLDP packets. This **improper input validation** is the primary weakness that allows a malicious user to trigger a denial-of-service condition.\n\"**Improper Input Handling:** NetworkManager fails to properly validate or sanitize incoming LLDP packets, particularly when debug logging is enabled.

The vulnerability results from the **lack of validation** on the malformed LLDP packets.\n\nThe crash leading to a denial of service suggests a secondary weakness related to resource management. The system likely exhausts resources due to the malformed packet, leading to the crash. Therefore, CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is considered as a secondary weakness.\n\nCWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) was considered but rejected. While a buffer overflow or similar memory corruption issue *could* be the underlying cause of the crash, there's no direct evidence of this in the provided descriptions. The focus is on the **lack of validation** rather than a specific memory safety issue.\nAlso, \"CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.\"\n\nUltimately, CWE-20 and CWE-400 are chosen as the most appropriate CWEs based on the available evidence, representing the initial **improper input validation** and the resulting **uncontrolled resource consumption** leading to a denial of service.",
