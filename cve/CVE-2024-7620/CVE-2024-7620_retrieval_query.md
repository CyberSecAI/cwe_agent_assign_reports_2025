# Retrieval Query for CVE-2024-7620

# Vulnerability Description

    The Customizer Export/Import plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to **missing file type validation** in the _import function in all versions up to, and including, 0.9.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible. NOTE This vulnerability is only exploitable when used in conjunction with a **race condition** as the uploaded file is deleted shortly after it is created.
