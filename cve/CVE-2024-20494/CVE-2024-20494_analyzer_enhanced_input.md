## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the TLS cryptography functionality of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to **improper data validation** during the TLS 1.3 handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted TLS 1.3 packet to an affected system through a TLS 1.3-enabled listening socket. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note This vulnerability can also impact the integrity of a device by causing VPN HostScan communication failures or file transfer failures when Cisco ASA Software is upgraded using Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM).

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper data validation**
- **impact:** denial of service (DoS) and integrity
- **vector:** crafted TLS 1.3 packet
- **attacker:** unauthenticated remote attacker
- **product:** ['Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance' and 'Cisco Firepower Threat Defense']
- **component:** TLS cryptography functionality

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper data validation during the TLS 1.3 handshake.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the TLS cryptography functionality of Cisco ASA and FTD software, specifically related to how it handles TLS 1.3 handshakes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause the affected device to reload unexpectedly, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability can also impact device integrity, causing VPN HostScan communication failures or file transfer failures during upgrades using Cisco ASDM.
- **Attack vectors:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted TLS 1.3 packet to an affected system through a TLS 1.3-enabled listening socket.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the affected system via a TLS 1.3-enabled socket. No prior authentication is required.
