  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/xe/guc_submit add **missing locking** in wedged_fini Any non-wedged queue can have a zero refcount here and can be running concurrently with an async queue destroy, therefore dereferencing the queue ptr to check wedge status after the lookup can trigger UAF if queue is not wedged. Fix this by keeping the submission_state lock held around the check to postpone the free and make the check safe, before dropping again around the put() to avoid the deadlock.

This vulnerability is caused by a **missing locking** mechanism that results in a race condition. The relationship between these CWEs shows that **improper locking** can lead to a UAF vulnerability, particularly in concurrent environments.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    \n    cwe416 <--|CAUSED_BY| cwe667\n    cwe667 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe362\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe667 secondary\n    class cwe362 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing Locking** (CWE-667) in `guc_submit_wedged_fini`.\n2.  **Weakness:** Race condition during async queue destroy.\n3.  **Impact:** Use-After-Free (CWE-416) when dereferencing queue pointer.\n    *   The chain starts with the lack of proper locking which allows the asynchronous queue destroy to happen concurrently with other operations, leading to a race condition. The race condition results in the UAF when the code attempts to access freed memory.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is a Use-After-Free (UAF) condition in the Linux kernel, specifically within the `drm/xe/guc_submit` component. This occurs due to a **missing locking** mechanism in `wedged_fini`, which allows a non-wedged queue to be concurrently destroyed while still being accessed. The dereferencing of the queue pointer after the lookup triggers the UAF if the queue is not wedged.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description key phrases clearly identifies the root cause as **missing locking** and the weakness as a **use-after-free**, leading to a UAF impact. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by detailing the race condition, the missing locking mechanism, and the resulting UAF vulnerability.\n\nThe Retriever Results strongly support CWE-416 (Use After Free) as the primary candidate, with a score of 1.0. CWE-667 (Improper Locking) is also relevant due to the **missing locking** being the root cause.\n\nBased on the evidence and analysis, the selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-416 accurately describes the UAF vulnerability, while CWE-667 captures the underlying root cause of **missing locking**.
