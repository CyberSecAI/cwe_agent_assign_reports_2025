CWE-1393 is a specific type of CWE-1391. Since the vulnerability description mentions **weak default passwords**, CWE-1393 is a more precise classification of the weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1393[\"CWE-1393: Use of Default Password\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe1393 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1393 primary\n    class cwe1391 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of weak default passwords** (CWE-1393). This allows unauthorized access to the Adtran 411 ONT device, potentially leading to further compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description states that the Adtran 411 ONT contains **weak default passwords**. The primary CWE is CWE-1393 (Use of Default Password) because it directly reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **use of weak default passwords**. The description does not mention how these passwords are used or hashed, so CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) is not applicable. CWE-1391 (Use of Weak Credentials) is a broader class encompassing CWE-1393, and while applicable, it is less specific. CWE-1393 is at the Base level of abstraction and is the most accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were
