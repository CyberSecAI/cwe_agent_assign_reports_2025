  "description": "The Booking for Appointments and Events Calendar &#8211 Amelia plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Full Path Disclosure** in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.19 via the wpAmeliaApiCall function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.",

This is a Class-level CWE, but is appropriate because it directly describes the **Full Path Disclosure** vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a request to the `wpAmeliaApiCall` function, which then results in the **Exposure of Sensitive Information**, specifically the full path of the web application.\n  - Root Cause: **Full Path Disclosure** due to the `wpAmeliaApiCall` function.\n  - Impact: Full path of the web application can be retrieved by unauthenticated attackers.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis concludes that CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor is the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability. This is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly states that the **Full Path Disclosure** makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-200.\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 is based on the evidence that the plugin **exposes sensitive information**. While other CWEs were considered, they did not accurately reflect the core issue of sensitive information exposure. The retriever results suggested CWE-201 Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data and CWE-209 Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information, but CWE-200 is a better fit because the vulnerability directly exposes the full path without necessarily inserting it into sent data or generating an error message.\n\nThe level of specificity of CWE-200 (Class) is adequate in this case, as the description accurately captures the essence of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
