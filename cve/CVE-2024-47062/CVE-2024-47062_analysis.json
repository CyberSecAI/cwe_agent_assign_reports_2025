  "description": "Navidrome is an open source web-based music collection server and streamer. Navidrome automatically adds parameters in the URL to SQL queries. This can be exploited to access information by adding parameters like `password=...` in the URL (ORM Leak). Furthermore, the names of the parameters are not properly escaped, leading to SQL Injections. Finally, the username is used in a `LIKE` statement, allowing people to log in with `%` instead of their username. When adding parameters to the URL, they are automatically included in an SQL `LIKE` statement (depending on the parameters name). This allows attackers to potentially retrieve arbitrary information. For example, attackers can use the following request to test whether some encrypted passwords start with `AAA`. This results in an SQL query like `password LIKE AAA%`, allowing attackers to slowly brute-force passwords. When adding parameters to the URL, they are automatically added to an SQL query. The names of the parameters are not properly escaped. This behavior can be used to inject arbitrary SQL code (SQL Injection). These vulnerabilities can be used to leak information and dump the contents of the database and have been addressed in release version 0.53.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content is related to CVE-2024-47062.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe application automatically adds URL parameters to SQL queries without proper sanitization. This occurs in three distinct ways:\n1.  URL parameters are included in SQL `LIKE` statements, enabling information leakage.\n2.  URL parameter names are not escaped, allowing for SQL injection.\n3.  Usernames used in a `LIKE` statement during authentication permit logins using wildcard characters like `%`.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n1.  **ORM Leak:**  Parameters passed in the URL are used in SQL LIKE statements, potentially exposing sensitive information by allowing partial string matches.\n2.  **SQL Injection:** Parameter names from the URL are directly inserted into SQL queries without proper escaping, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n3.  **Authentication Weakness:**  The use of a `LIKE` operator in the username lookup allows users to log in with wildcard characters, bypassing authentication.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n1.  **ORM Leak:** Attackers can potentially retrieve arbitrary information, including sensitive data like password fragments, by exploiting the SQL `LIKE` statement behavior.\n2.  **SQL Injections:** Attackers can inject arbitrary SQL code, leading to database compromise, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.\n3.  **Authentication Weakness:**  Attackers can bypass authentication by using the wildcard `%` as a username.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe attack vectors involve crafting malicious HTTP GET requests that include specific parameters in the URL.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nAttackers require a network connection to the vulnerable application and need to craft malicious URLs. They require low privileges to exploit the vulnerability and no user interaction is required.",

The vulnerability description details how URL parameters are directly used in SQL queries without proper escaping, leading to SQL injection. CWE-201 is considered as a secondary weakness, as the SQL injection allows for the potential extraction and exposure of sensitive information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe89 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe201\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n    class cwe74 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper input escaping**, leading to SQL Injection (CWE-89). This allows an attacker to potentially extract sensitive information (CWE-201) from the database. The root cause is the failure to properly sanitize URL parameters before incorporating them into SQL queries.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is CWE-89, supported by the vulnerability description that explicitly mentions SQL injection due to **improper input escaping** of URL parameters used in SQL queries. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section also confirms that \"parameter names from the URL are directly inserted into SQL queries without proper escaping, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities\". CWE-201 is a secondary concern because the SQL injection could lead to the leakage of sensitive information.\n\nThe retriever results strongly support CWE-89 as the top candidate.\n\nThe decision to map CWE-89 at the Base level is based on the CWE specifications which state that it is at the \"Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\"\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
