This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.\n- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database.\n- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data.\n- **Comprehensive System Control:** Attackers may gain comprehensive control over the system.\n- **Service Interruption:** Attackers may cause service disruptions.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The vulnerability is exposed through the `admin/edit-customer-detailed.php` file via HTTP POST request.\n- The attack vector is the `name` parameter.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker does not need any prior login or authorization to exploit this vulnerability.\n- The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable script.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- The vulnerability can be exploited with boolean-based blind SQL injection and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.\n- The provided payloads demonstrate how to achieve this using the `name` parameter.\n- The attacker can use tools like sqlmap to automate the exploitation process.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The provided content includes a detailed description of the vulnerability and provides example payloads and sqlmap commands for exploitation.\n- It also suggests repair strategies like using prepared statements and parameter binding, input validation, minimizing database user permissions, and regular security audits.",

Other CWEs like CWE-79 and CWE-434 were considered based on retriever results but deemed less relevant. The relationships of CWE-89 to its parents (e.g., CWE-74 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) and children were considered, but the Base level of CWE-89 was the most appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe79,cwe434 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of the `name` argument, leading to **SQL injection**, which could allow unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and service interruption.\n\nImproper Input Handling (name parameter) -> **SQL Injection** (CWE-89) -> Unauthorized Database Access/Data Leakage/System Control\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The root cause of the vulnerability is clearly identified as **SQL injection** due to the **improper handling** of the `name` parameter in the `edit-customer-detailed.php` file.\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')), which directly aligns with the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links summary. The evidence for this is the statement that \"The manipulation of the argument name leads to **sql injection**.\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary which states: \"The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `admin/edit-customer-detailed.php` file of the \"Beauty Parlour Management System PHP SQLite Project\". The vulnerability arises from insufficient user input validation of the `name` parameter.\"\n\nOther CWEs such as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) and CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) were considered based on the retriever results, but they were not as directly relevant to the vulnerability description as CWE-89. CWE-79 is related to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), which is a different type of vulnerability than **SQL Injection**. CWE-434 relates to file uploads, which is not mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it accurately represents the root cause of the vulnerability (i.e., **SQL Injection**). It is a Base-level CWE, which is preferred for mapping root causes.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
