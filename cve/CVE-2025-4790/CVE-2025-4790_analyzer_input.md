## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-4790 Content

Based on the provided content, this relates to a vulnerability in Freefloat FTP Server version 1.0. It is a remote buffer overflow triggered by the 'GLOB' command.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the handling of the 'GLOB' command in Freefloat FTP Server 1.0. The server does not properly validate the length of the input provided with the 'GLOB' command, allowing an attacker to send a larger payload than the buffer can handle, overwriting adjacent memory regions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Buffer Overflow
*   Improper Input Validation

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows the attacker to overwrite the execution flow of the program, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. The exploit author demonstrates achieving a reverse shell.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Remote: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via the FTP protocol.
*   Specifically, sending a crafted 'GLOB' command to the FTP server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Network access to the target Freefloat FTP Server.
*   Ability to send crafted FTP commands.
*   Knowledge of the buffer overflow offset (246 bytes in this case) and the target address for EIP (0x7C86467B - JMP ESP).

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not provide information about a specific fix. However, mitigation would involve:

*   Implementing proper input validation for the 'GLOB' command to prevent overflows.
*   Using safe string handling functions to avoid buffer overflows.
*   Applying any available patches or updates for Freefloat FTP Server.

**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**

The content provides a complete exploit script, including:

*   The offset to reach EIP (246 bytes).
*   The EIP address to redirect execution to a JMP ESP instruction (0x7C86467B).
*   A payload generated using `msfvenom` to establish a reverse TCP shell.
*   Bad characters to avoid (\x00\x0a\x0d).
*   Detailed steps for exploiting the vulnerability, including connecting to the FTP server, authenticating as anonymous, and sending the malicious 'GLOB' command.
*   The exploit author and date of discovery.
