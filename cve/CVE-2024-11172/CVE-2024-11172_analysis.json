  "description": "A vulnerability in danny-avila/librechat version git a1647d7 allows an unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial of service by sending a crafted payload to the server. The middleware `checkBan` is not surrounded by a try-catch block, and an **unhandled exception** will cause the server to crash. This issue is fixed in version 0.7.6.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2024-11172 Content\n\nThe provided content relates to a commit in the LibreChat repository addressing error handling and logging in the `checkBan` middleware.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe original code lacked proper error handling within the `checkBan` middleware. This could lead to unhandled exceptions and potentially disrupt the application's functionality when checking for user or IP bans.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Lack of error handling in middleware.\n*   Potential for application disruption due to unhandled exceptions.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nUnhandled exceptions could lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior, potentially impacting availability or user experience.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nWhile not a direct exploit, the lack of error handling could be triggered by unexpected input or conditions during the ban check process.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\nNo specific attacker capabilities or position are required to trigger the issue. It's a code quality issue that could be exposed through normal application usage.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe commit adds a `try...catch` block around the core logic of the `checkBan` middleware. This allows the code to catch any exceptions that occur during the ban check process and log the error using the configured logger. This prevents unhandled exceptions from crashing the application and provides valuable debugging information.\n\n**More detail than official CVE description:**\n\nYes, the content provides specific code changes and details about the error handling implementation, which is more detailed than a typical CVE description.",

The root cause is an unhandled exception, leading to a crash. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship to consider is that CWE-248 [CWE-248: Uncaught Exception] can lead to a denial of service (DoS). While CWE-703 [CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions] and CWE-755 [CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions] are related to exception handling, they are too abstract.

The `checkBan` middleware lacks a try-catch block.\n2.  A crafted payload triggers an exception.\n3.  The exception is uncaught (CWE-248 [CWE-248: Uncaught Exception]).\n4.  The server crashes, resulting in a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that an **unhandled exception** in the `checkBan` middleware causes the server to crash. The CVE reference links content summary confirms the **lack of error handling** as the root cause. The mitigation involves adding a `try...catch` block to prevent the crash.\n\nThe Retriever Results list CWE-248 [CWE-248: Uncaught Exception] as the top candidate, further supporting this classification. While other CWEs like CWE-755 [CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions] (Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions) are related to exception handling, CWE-248 [CWE-248: Uncaught Exception] is the most specific and accurate representation of the **root cause**. The evidence directly supports CWE-248 [CWE-248: Uncaught Exception] at the Base level of abstraction.\n\nThe selected CWE-248 [CWE-248: Uncaught Exception] is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **unhandled exception** that leads to the denial of service.",
