  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Meteor up to 3.2.1 and classified as problematic. This issue affects the function Object.assign of the file packages/ddp-server/livedata_server.js. The manipulation of the argument forwardedFor leads to **inefficient regular expression complexity**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 3.2.2 is able to address this issue. The identifier of the patch is f7ea6817b90952baaea9baace2a3b4366fee6a63. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.",

  "reference_content": "CVE-2025-4727: PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval\n\nBased on the provided content, this relates to a ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerability in the Meteor framework. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability lies in the parsing of the `x-forwarded-for` header within the `livedata_server.js` file. Specifically, the way comma-separated values are handled in `Session._clientAddress`.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   ReDoS vulnerability due to potentially inefficient regular expression handling when parsing the `x-forwarded-for` header.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   The vulnerability could potentially lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker could craft a malicious `x-forwarded-for` header with a specially designed string to trigger the ReDoS vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to control the `x-forwarded-for` header, typically by sending a crafted HTTP request to the server.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The fix involved:\n    *   Changing the header splitting method to handle comma-separated values more reliably.\n    *   Adding explicit trimming of IP addresses.\n    *   Modifying the validation check to require an exact match for `httpForwardedCount`.\n    *   Updating the `ddp-server` package to version 3.1.1.\n*   The fix was merged into the `release-3.2.1` branch.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The original issue was reported as issue #13713 on GitHub and addressed by pull request #13721.\n*   The discussion suggests a CVE ID might be requested for tracking purposes.\n*   The issue was initially titled \"ReDoS Vulnerability in ddp-server/\\_clientAddress via x-forwarded-for Header\" but was later changed to \"Refactor IP address parsing on Webapp\".\n*   The fix also includes a changelog entry documenting the changes.\n\nThis content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.",
