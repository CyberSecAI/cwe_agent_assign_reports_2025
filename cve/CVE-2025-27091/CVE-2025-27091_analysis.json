  "description": "OpenH264 is a free license codec library which supports H.264 encoding and decoding. A vulnerability in the decoding functions of OpenH264 codec library could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to trigger a **heap overflow**. This vulnerability is due to a **race condition** between a Sequence Parameter Set (SPS) memory allocation and a subsequent non Instantaneous Decoder Refresh (non-IDR) Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) unit memory usage. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious bitstream and tricking a victim user into processing an arbitrary video containing the malicious bistream. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected crash in the victims user decoding client and, possibly, perform arbitrary commands on the victims host by abusing the **heap overflow**. This vulnerability affects OpenH264 2.5.0 and earlier releases. Both Scalable Video Coding (SVC) mode and Advanced Video Coding (AVC) mode are affected by this vulnerability. OpenH264 software releases 2.6.0 and later contained the fix for this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory * [Open an issue in cisco/openh264](https//github.com/cisco/openh264/issues) * Email Cisco Open Source Security ([oss-security@cisco.com](mailtooss-security@cisco.com)) and Cisco PSIRT ([psirt@cisco.com](mailtopsirt@cisco.com)) ### Credits * **Research** Octavian Guzu and Andrew Calvano of Meta * **Fix ideation** Philipp Hancke and Shyam Sadhwani of Meta * **Fix implementation** Benzheng Zhang (@BenzhengZhang) * **Release engineering** Benzheng Zhang (@BenzhengZhang)",

CWE-367 is a base CWE and can precede CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), which is a parent of CWE-122.

This **race condition** leads to a **heap overflow** (CWE-122). The **heap overflow** can then cause an unexpected crash or potentially allow arbitrary command execution.\n\nCWE-367 (Race Condition) -> CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) -> Impact (Crash/Arbitrary Command Execution)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is a **race condition** (CWE-367) that results in a **heap overflow** (CWE-122). The description clearly states that the vulnerability is due to a **race condition** during memory allocation, which then allows an attacker to cause an unexpected crash or potentially perform arbitrary commands by abusing the **heap overflow**.\n\nThe evidence for CWE-367 is: \"This vulnerability is due to a **race condition** between a Sequence Parameter Set (SPS) memory allocation and a subsequent non Instantaneous Decoder Refresh (non-IDR) Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) unit memory usage.\"\n\nThe evidence for CWE-122 is: \"A vulnerability in the decoding functions of OpenH264 codec library could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to trigger a **heap overflow**.\" and \"An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious bitstream and tricking a victim user into processing an arbitrary video containing the malicious bistream...by abusing the **heap overflow**.\"\n\nCWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) was considered but not selected as the primary CWE because it is a more general class and the description provides enough detail to identify the specific **race condition** leading to a **heap overflow**. CWE-122 is selected because the **heap overflow** is a direct consequence of the **race condition**, and the description explicitly mentions it.\n\nThe selection of CWE-367 and CWE-122 is at the optimal level of specificity as they accurately represent the root cause and immediate consequence of the vulnerability, respectively.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
