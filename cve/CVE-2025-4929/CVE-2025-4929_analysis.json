  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Campcodes Online Shopping Portal 1.0. It has been rated as critical. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /my-account.php. The manipulation of the argument Name leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

The content from www.campcodes.com is unrelated.\n\n**github.com_04e31640_20250624_202336.html**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient user input validation of the 'name' parameter in the '/my-account.php' file. Attackers can inject malicious SQL queries because the input is used directly in SQL queries without proper sanitization.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability in the '/my-account.php' file.\n*   **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and service interruption.\n*   **Attack vectors**: Exploiting the 'name' parameter via a POST request.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint and inject malicious SQL code into the 'name' parameter.\n*   **Mitigation or fix**:\n    1.  Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n    2.  Input validation and filtering.\n    3.  Minimize database user permissions.\n    4.  Regular security audits.\n\n**More detail than official CVE description**: This content provides a PoC, specific affected file, and detailed remediation steps, which are not always included in the official CVE description.",

The retriever results strongly suggested CWE-89 as the most appropriate mapping. No other CWEs were deemed necessary as the description focuses solely on SQL Injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single point:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')** (CWE-89) due to insufficient input validation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference link summary, which both explicitly state the presence of an **SQL Injection** vulnerability. The vulnerability description key phrases also highlight \"**SQL Injection**\" as the **weakness**. The github.com content confirms that the root cause is insufficient user input validation of the 'name' parameter in the '/my-account.php' file. This input is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization, leading to CWE-89.\n\nThe retriever results further support this assessment, with CWE-89 receiving the highest score. The CWE's description directly aligns with the vulnerability: \"The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input...but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements...\". The proposed mitigations, such as using prepared statements and input validation, are standard SQL Injection defenses, reinforcing this mapping.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as it directly represents the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
