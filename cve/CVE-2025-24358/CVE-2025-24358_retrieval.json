  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2025-24358', description='gorilla/csrf provides **Cross Site Request Forgery** (CSRF) prevention middleware for Go web applications & services. Prior to 1.7.2, gorilla/csrf does not validate the Origin header against an allowlist. Its executes its validation of the Referer header for cross-origin requests only when it believes the request is being served over TLS. It determines this by inspecting the r.URL.Scheme value. However, this value is never populated for server requests per the Go spec, and so this check does not run in practice. This vulnerability allows an attacker who has gained **XSS** on a subdomain or top level domain to perform authenticated form submissions against gorilla/csrf protected targets that share the same top level domain. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.7.2.', key_phrases={'rootcause': '', 'weakness': ['cross-origin request forgery', 'Cross Site Request Forgery', 'XSS'], 'impact': ['perform authenticated form submissions', 'cross-site scripting'], 'vector': '', 'attacker': 'attacker', 'product': 'gorilla/csrf', 'version': 'prior to 1.7.2', 'component': ''}, reference_content='## CVE-2025-24358 Analysis\\n\\nHere\\'s an analysis of the provided content related to CVE-2025-24358, extracted and organized according to the guidelines:\\n\\n**1. Verification:**\\n\\nThe content directly relates to CVE-2025-24358, as explicitly stated in the security advisory (DLA 4151-1) and the GitHub security advisory.\\n\\n**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**\\n\\nThe root cause is that `gorilla/csrf` does not properly validate the `Origin` header and incorrectly determines if a request is served over TLS. It relies on `r.URL.Scheme`, which is not populated for \"server\" requests according to the Go specification. This leads to Referer header validation being bypassed in certain scenarios.\\n\\n**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n\\n*   **Improper Input Validation:** Failure to validate the `Origin` header against an allowlist.\\n*   **Incorrect Security Checks:**  Incorrectly determining TLS status based on `r.URL.Scheme`, leading to bypassed Referer validation.\\n*   **CSRF Vulnerability:**  The combination of these issues results in a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.\\n\\n**4. Impact of exploitation:**\\n\\nAn attacker with XSS on a subdomain or top-level domain can perform authenticated form submissions against targets protected by `gorilla/csrf` that share the same top-level domain.\\n\\n**5. Attack vectors:**\\n\\n*   **XSS:** Requires the attacker to first gain Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) on a subdomain or top-level domain.\\n*   **Cookie Exfiltration:** The attacker exfiltrates the CSRF token and cookie combination.\\n*   **Cookie Manipulation:** The attacker sets the exfiltrated cookie with a domain scope (`.example.test`) and path (`/submit`).\\n*   **Form Submission:** The attacker submits a form from the attacker\\'s origin with the exfiltrated token.\\n\\n**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n\\n*   Ability to execute JavaScript (XSS) on a subdomain or top-level domain of the target.\\n*   Ability to read cookies and form tokens.\\n*   Understanding of CSRF vulnerabilities and how to exploit them.\\n\\n**7. Mitigation or fix:**\\n\\n*   **Upgrade:** Upgrade to version 1.7.3 or later of the `gorilla/csrf` package.\\n*   **Debian Specific:** For Debian 11 bullseye, upgrade to version 1.6.2-2+deb11u1.\\n*   **Rebuild Packages:** Rebuild dependent Go packages (golang-chroma, golang-github-alecthomas-chroma-dev, etc.) after upgrading `golang-github-gorilla-csrf`.\\n\\n**Additional Details (More than CVE Description):**\\n\\n*   The vulnerability has existed in `gorilla/csrf` since its initial release in 2015.\\n*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) is available upon request from [@patrickod](https://github.com/patrickod).\\n*   The Debian security tracker page is provided for further information: <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/golang-github-gorilla-csrf>\\n*   The commit 9dd6af1 attempts to address the issue by adding context keys to signal TLS state and enabling Referer-based origin checks by default.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:cross-origin request forgery', 'keyphrase': 'cross-origin request forgery', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:Cross Site Request Forgery', 'keyphrase': 'Cross Site Request Forgery', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:perform authenticated form submissions', 'keyphrase': 'perform authenticated form submissions', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'impact:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'attacker:attacker', 'keyphrase': 'attacker', 'type': 'attacker'}, {'id': 'product:gorilla/csrf', 'keyphrase': 'gorilla/csrf', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:prior to 1.7.2', 'keyphrase': 'prior to 1.7.2', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(748.2523590529686)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '346', 'name': 'Origin Validation Error', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:cross-origin request forgery', 'keyphrase': 'cross-origin request forgery', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:perform authenticated form submissions', 'keyphrase': 'perform authenticated form submissions', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'attacker:attacker', 'keyphrase': 'attacker', 'type': 'attacker'}, {'id': 'product:gorilla/csrf', 'keyphrase': 'gorilla/csrf', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:prior to 1.7.2', 'keyphrase': 'prior to 1.7.2', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(679.7719342105192)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '601', 'name': \"URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application accepts a user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site, and uses that link in a redirect.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:Cross Site Request Forgery', 'keyphrase': 'Cross Site Request Forgery', 'type': 'weakness'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(677.5082991505639)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '89', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    gorilla/csrf provides **Cross Site Request Forgery** (CSRF) prevention middleware for Go web applications & services. Prior to 1.7.2, gorilla/csrf does not validate the Origin header against an allowlist. Its executes its validation of the Referer header for cross-origin requests only when it believes the request is being served over TLS. It determines this by inspecting the r.URL.Scheme value. However, this value is never populated for server requests per the Go spec, and so this check does not run in practice. This vulnerability allows an attacker who has gained **XSS** on a subdomain or top level domain to perform authenticated form submissions against gorilla/csrf protected targets that share the same top level domain. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.7.2.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## WEAKNESS: 'cross-origin request forgery'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1.
