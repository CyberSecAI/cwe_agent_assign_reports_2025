## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-4215 Content

Here's an analysis of the provided content, focusing on information related to CVE-2025-4215, following the given guidelines:

**1. Verification:**

The content from `lists.debian.org` directly references CVE-2025-4215 and provides details about a security update for `ublock-origin`. The other content is related to uBlock but doesn't directly mention the CVE.

**2. Relevant Content Extraction:**

Here's the extracted information from the `lists.debian.org` content:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** An inefficient regular expression in ublock-origin's filters.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS).
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Denial-of-service, freezing of a web browser.
*   **Attack vectors:** Abuse of the inefficient regular expression with a crafted input string.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remote attacker.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** Upgrade to version `1.62.0+dfsg-0+deb11u1`. The fix replaces the vulnerable regex with a more efficient solution.
*   **Debian Bug:** 1104635
*   **Security Tracker:** <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ublock-origin>

The github content shows the fix being applied to the code, replacing `/\s+$/` with `trimEnd()` and `/(?:^|\S)(\s+)$/`.

**3. Additional Notes:**

*   The Debian advisory provides more detail than a typical CVE description, specifically mentioning the version number of the fix and a link to the security tracker.
*   The github content confirms the code changes related to the fix.
*   The other content (github pages, wiki) is related to uBlock Origin but does not contain specific vulnerability information related to CVE-2025-4215.
