  "reference_content": "Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the provided content, focusing on CVE-2025-2747 (Note: The content provided does not explicitly mention a CVE ID. Information about the vulnerability is presented as WT-2025-0011, WT-2025-0006 and WT-2025-0007):\n\n**Vulnerability:** WT-2025-0011 Authentication Bypass (More detail than the official CVE description)\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is found in the obsolete Microsoft Web Service Enhancement 3.0 (WSE3) library, specifically the `Microsoft.Web.Services3.Security.Tokens.UsernameTokenManager.VerifyPassword` method. This method does not properly validate the lack of a password when the `PasswordOption` is set to `SendNone`, allowing authentication bypass.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    *   Authentication Bypass: The vulnerability allows bypassing authentication on the Kentico Xperience CMS Staging API.\n    *   Logical Flaw in WSE3 library: The library's design allows authentication without a password when `PasswordOption.SendNone` is set.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:**\n    *   Full administrative access to the Kentico's Staging SOAP API.\n    *   Access with \"global admin\" rights.\n    *   Allows the attacker to fully control the Kentico Xperience CMS.\n*   **Attack vectors:**\n    *   Crafting a malicious SOAP request header.\n    *   The attack involves sending a SOAP request to the `/CMSPages/Staging/SyncServer.asmx` endpoint.\n    *   The SOAP header should contain a `<wsse:UsernameToken>` element with the `<wsse:Username>` tag and without the `<wsse:Password>` tag.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n    *   The attacker needs to send a crafted SOAP request to the target system.\n    *   In versions 13.0.173 to 13.0.177, the attacker must know a valid Staging Service username.\n    *   Prior to version 13.0.173, one can provide any username.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:**\n    *   Fixed in Kentico Xperience 13.0.178.\n\n**Vulnerability:** WT-2025-0006 Authentication Bypass (More detail than the official CVE description)\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is an authentication bypass in the Kentico Xperience CMS Staging API.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    *   Authentication Bypass: The vulnerability allows bypassing authentication on the Kentico Xperience CMS Staging API.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:**\n    *   Full administrative access to the Kentico's Staging SOAP API.\n    *   Access with \"global admin\" rights.\n    *   Allows the attacker to fully control the Kentico Xperience CMS.\n*   **Attack vectors:**\n    *   Crafting a malicious SOAP request header.\n    *   The attack involves sending a SOAP request to the `/CMSPages/Staging/SyncServer.asmx` endpoint.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:**\n    *   Fixed in Kentico Xperience 13.0.173.\n\n**Vulnerability:** WT-2025-0007 Post-Auth Remote Code Execution (More detail than the official CVE description)\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Path traversal vulnerability within the media file upload functionality of the Kentico Xperience CMS. The `CheckAndEnsureFilePath` method does not adequately validate the `librarySubFolderPath` parameter, allowing for directory traversal.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    *   Path Traversal: The attacker can specify a path (e.g., `../../../../../../../../inetpub/wwwroot/Kentico13/CMS/CMSPages/`) in the `FilePath` field of a media file upload, leading to the ability to write files to arbitrary locations on the server.\n    *   Remote Code Execution: Because of the path traversal vulnerability, the attacker can upload a webshell file and execute arbitrary code.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:**\n    *   Remote Code Execution: An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary code on the server by uploading a webshell via a path traversal vulnerability.\n*   **Attack vectors:**\n    *   Combining Authentication Bypass (WT-2025-0006 or WT-2025-0011) with the path traversal vulnerability in the Staging API.\n    *   The attack involves crafting a SOAP request to the `/CMSPages/Staging/SyncServer.asmx` endpoint.\n    *   Upload a malicious file (e.g., a webshell aspx file).\n    *   Exploit path traversal vulnerability by modifying the `FilePath` in the `Media_File` section of the SOAP request.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n    *   Access to the Staging API (achieved through Authentication Bypass).\n    *   Knowledge of the file system structure of the target system.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:**\n    *   Fixed in Kentico Xperience 13.0.178.",

CWE-289 is a secondary CWE because the **authentication bypass** occurs through what could be considered an alternate name or channel. There is a ChildOf relationship between CWE-289 and CWE-1390, and between CWE-306 and CWE-287, but those classes are too abstract. CWE-306 and CWE-289 are both Base level CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe289[\"CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe289 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe289 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** (CWE-306) for the Staging Sync Server component. This allows an attacker to bypass authentication (CWE-289). The impact of this bypass is the ability to control administrative objects, leading to full control of the Kentico Xperience CMS.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary vulnerability is the **missing authentication** (CWE-306) in the Staging Sync Server component. The vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary provides strong evidence for this. Specifically, the root cause identified in the CVE reference links mentions that the `Microsoft.Web.Services3.Security.Tokens.UsernameTokenManager.VerifyPassword` method does not properly validate the lack of a password when the `PasswordOption` is set to `SendNone`, allowing **authentication bypass**. This directly aligns with CWE-306, which describes a situation where the product does not perform any authentication for critical functionality.\n\nCWE-289, **Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name**, is a secondary concern, as the **bypass** occurs because of the way the component handles the password or lack thereof.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but deemed less appropriate. For example, CWE-287 (**Improper Authentication**) is a parent of CWE-306 but is too general. CWE-862 (**Missing Authorization**) was considered, but the issue is with authentication, not authorization. CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**) was also considered but did not fit because the issue is not with the authorization check itself, but rather with the lack of authentication.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-306 accurately representing the **missing authentication** and CWE-289 capturing the **authentication bypass** aspect of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
