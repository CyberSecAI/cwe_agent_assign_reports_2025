  "description": "Netskope was made aware of a security vulnerability in Netskope Endpoint DLPs Content Control Driver where a **double-fetch issue** leads to heap overflow. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the NumberOfBytes argument to ExAllocatePoolWithTag, and the Length argument for RtlCopyMemory, both independently dereference their value from the user supplied input buffer inside the EpdlpSetUsbAction function, known as a double-fetch. If this length value grows to a higher value in between these two calls, it will result in the RtlCopyMemory call copying user-supplied memory contents outside the range of the allocated buffer, resulting in a heap overflow. A malicious attacker will need admin privileges to exploit the issue. This issue affects Endpoint DLP version below R119.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is a double-fetch issue in the Netskope Endpoint DLP's Content Control Driver.\n*   The `NumberOfBytes` argument to `ExAllocatePoolWithTag` and the `Length` argument for `RtlCopyMemory` both independently dereference their values from the user-supplied input buffer within the `EpdlpSetUsbAction` function.\n*   This double-fetch can lead to a heap overflow if the length value increases between the two calls.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Double-Fetch:** The vulnerability stems from reading the length of the buffer from user input twice without proper validation in between.\n*   **Heap Overflow:** If the length value grows between the `ExAllocatePoolWithTag` call and the `RtlCopyMemory` call, `RtlCopyMemory` copies memory outside the bounds of the allocated buffer.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   A successful exploit leads to a heap overflow.\n*   This could potentially allow an attacker to overwrite critical data on the heap, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   The vulnerability exists in the Netskope Endpoint DLP's Content Control Driver, specifically in the `EpdlpSetUsbAction` function.\n*   The attack involves crafting a malicious user-supplied input buffer with a manipulated length that changes between the double-fetch operations.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs administrative privileges on the target Windows system to exploit this vulnerability.\n*   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the input buffer that reaches the vulnerable function.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is identified as **CVE-2024-11616**.\n*   The affected product is **Netskope Endpoint DLP** on **Windows**.\n*   The affected versions are all versions **below R119**.\n*   A patch is available in versions **R119 and above**, and backported to versions **R114 and R117**.\n*   A workaround is available by enabling tamperproofing using \u201cProtect Netskope Client Configuration and Resources\u201d.\n*   The vulnerability was reported by Thomas Brice from Oxford Nanopore Technologies.\n*   Netskope is not aware of any active exploitation of the issue at the time of the advisory release.",

CWE-131 and CWE-193 can precede CWE-119 and therefore also CWE-787. This hierarchy indicates that the out-of-bounds write is a consequence of either an incorrect calculation of the buffer size or an off-by-one error, both of which contribute to the primary weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe131[\"CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\"]\n    cwe193[\"CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe131 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    cwe193 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe131,cwe193 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **double-fetch issue**, which leads to an incorrect buffer size calculation. This incorrect calculation results in an out-of-bounds write during the `RtlCopyMemory` operation, ultimately causing a heap overflow.\n  - Double Fetch (Root Cause) -> Incorrect Buffer Size Calculation -> Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787) -> Heap Overflow (Impact).\n  - The **Primary CWE** is CWE-787, which identifies the write outside the buffer that led to the vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis and criticism were based on the provided evidence, which clearly indicates a **double-fetch issue** leading to a heap overflow due to an out-of-bounds write. The relationship graph highlights how the root cause can be traced back to either an incorrect buffer size calculation or an off-by-one error. The final selection of CWEs is based on the specificity of the vulnerability details and the mapping guidance provided by MITRE.\n\nEvidence for CWE-787 includes the following phrases from the vulnerability description: \"If this length value grows to a higher value in between these two calls, it will result in the RtlCopyMemory call copying user-supplied memory contents outside the range of the allocated buffer, resulting in a heap overflow.\"\n\nCWE-787 is the optimal level of specificity as it directly describes the out-of-bounds write condition. CWE-131 and CWE-193 are included as they could be contributing factors to the incorrect buffer size, but the primary issue is the write outside the buffer.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
