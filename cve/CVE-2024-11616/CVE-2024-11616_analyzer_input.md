# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-11616

## Vulnerability Description
Netskope was made aware of a security vulnerability in Netskope Endpoint DLPs Content Control Driver where a **double-fetch issue** leads to heap overflow. The vulnerability arises from the fact that the NumberOfBytes argument to ExAllocatePoolWithTag, and the Length argument for RtlCopyMemory, both independently dereference their value from the user supplied input buffer inside the EpdlpSetUsbAction function, known as a double-fetch. If this length value grows to a higher value in between these two calls, it will result in the RtlCopyMemory call copying user-supplied memory contents outside the range of the allocated buffer, resulting in a heap overflow. A malicious attacker will need admin privileges to exploit the issue. This issue affects Endpoint DLP version below R119.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** EpdlpSetUsbAction function
- **rootcause:** **double-fetch issue**
- **weakness:** **double-fetch, heap overflow**
- **product:** Netskope Endpoint DLPs Content Control Driver

- **version:** below R119

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a double-fetch issue in the Netskope Endpoint DLP's Content Control Driver.
*   The `NumberOfBytes` argument to `ExAllocatePoolWithTag` and the `Length` argument for `RtlCopyMemory` both independently dereference their values from the user-supplied input buffer within the `EpdlpSetUsbAction` function.
*   This double-fetch can lead to a heap overflow if the length value increases between the two calls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Double-Fetch:** The vulnerability stems from reading the length of the buffer from user input twice without proper validation in between.
*   **Heap Overflow:** If the length value grows between the `ExAllocatePoolWithTag` call and the `RtlCopyMemory` call, `RtlCopyMemory` copies memory outside the bounds of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A successful exploit leads to a heap overflow.
*   This could potentially allow an attacker to overwrite critical data on the heap, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the Netskope Endpoint DLP's Content Control Driver, specifically in the `EpdlpSetUsbAction` function.
*   The attack involves crafting a malicious user-supplied input buffer with a manipulated length that changes between the double-fetch operations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs administrative privileges on the target Windows system to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the input buffer that reaches the vulnerable function.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is identified as **CVE-2024-11616**.
*   The affected product is **Netskope Endpoint DLP** on **Windows**.
*   The affected versions are all versions **below R119**.
*   A patch is available in versions **R119 and above**, and backported to versions **R114 and R117**.
*   A workaround is available by enabling tamperproofing using “Protect Netskope Client Configuration and Resources”.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Thomas Brice from Oxford Nanopore Technologies.
*   Netskope is not aware of any active exploitation of the issue at the time of the advisory release.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
