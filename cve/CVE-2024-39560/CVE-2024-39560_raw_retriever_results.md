# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-39560
## Query
An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a logically adjacent downstream RSVP neighbor to cause kernel memory exhaustion, leading to a kernel crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). The kernel memory leak and eventual crash will be seen when the downstream RSVP neighbor has a persistent error which will not be corrected. System kernel memory can be monitored through the use of the show system statistics kernel memory command as shown below user@router> show system statistics kernel memory Memory Size (kB) Percentage When Active 753092 18.4% Now Inactive 574300 14.0% Now Wired 443236 10.8% Now Cached 1911204 46.6% Now Buf 32768 0.8% Now Free 385072 9.4% Now Kernel Memory Now Data 312908 7.6% Now Text 2560 0.1% Now ...
