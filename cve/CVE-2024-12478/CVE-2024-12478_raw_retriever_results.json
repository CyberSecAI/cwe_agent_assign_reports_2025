  "query": "A vulnerability was found in InvoicePlane up to 1.6.1. It has been declared as critical. This vulnerability affects the function upload_file of the file /index.php/upload/upload_file/1/1. The manipulation of the argument file leads to unrestricted upload. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 1.6.2-beta-1 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The vendor was contacted early, responded in a very professional manner and quickly released a fixed version of the affected product.",
