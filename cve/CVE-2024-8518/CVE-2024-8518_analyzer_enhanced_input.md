    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'Improper Input Validation'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-20: Improper Input Validation (Score: 207.98)

The product receives input or data, but it does
        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the
        properties that are required to process the data safely and
        correctly....

### 2. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 206.03)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...
