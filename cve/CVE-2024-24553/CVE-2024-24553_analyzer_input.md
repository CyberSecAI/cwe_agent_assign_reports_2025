# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-24553

## Vulnerability Description
**Bludit uses the SHA-1 hashing algorithm to compute password hashes**. Thus, attackers could determine cleartext passwords with brute-force attacks due to the inherent speed of SHA-1. In addition, the salt that is computed by Bludit is generated with a non-cryptographically secure function.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Bludit uses the SHA-1 hashing algorithm to compute password hashes**
- **impact:** determine cleartext passwords with brute-force attacks
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** Bludit

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-24553:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the SHA-1 hashing algorithm for password storage, which is considered weak due to its computational speed, making it susceptible to brute-force attacks. Additionally, the salt used in hashing is generated using a non-cryptographically secure `rand()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Weak Hashing Algorithm:** SHA-1 is fast and therefore vulnerable to brute force attacks.
2.  **Insecure Salt Generation:** The use of PHP's `rand()` function for salt generation makes the salts predictable, further weakening the password hashing process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to determine cleartext passwords by performing brute-force attacks on the stored password hashes. The combination of SHA-1 and a predictable salt makes this process significantly faster and easier for an attacker. This would allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited offline; by obtaining the database or any other storage with the password hashes, the attacker can try to brute force it to gain access to user credentials

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to the stored password hashes (e.g., database dump or access to the server) is necessary.
- No specific user-level privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability once the attacker has the password hashes.
