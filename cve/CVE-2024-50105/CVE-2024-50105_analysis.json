  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ASoC qcom sc7280 Fix missing Soundwire runtime stream alloc Commit 15c7fab0e047 (ASoC qcom Move Soundwire runtime stream alloc to soundcards) moved the allocation of Soundwire stream runtime from the Qualcomm Soundwire driver to each individual machine sound card driver, except that it **forgot to update SC7280 card**. Just like for other Qualcomm sound cards using Soundwire, the card driver should allocate and release the runtime. Otherwise sound playback will result in a NULL pointer dereference or other effect of **uninitialized memory** accesses (which was confirmed on SDM845 having similar issue).",

This vulnerability is a result of a missing Soundwire runtime stream allocation.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n- A previous commit (15c7fab0e047) moved the allocation of the Soundwire stream runtime from the Qualcomm Soundwire driver to individual machine sound card drivers.\n- The SC7280 sound card driver was not updated to perform this allocation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n- Missing allocation of the Soundwire runtime stream in the SC7280 driver.\n- This results in a NULL pointer dereference or other effects due to uninitialized memory access during sound playback.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n-  A NULL pointer dereference or uninitialized memory access during sound playback, potentially leading to system instability or crashes.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n- Triggering sound playback using the SC7280 sound card.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n- The attacker needs to be able to initiate sound playback on a system using the affected SC7280 sound card.",

  "analysis": "# Summary\n| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| CWE-909 | Missing Initialization of Resource | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |\n| CWE-476 | NULL Pointer Dereference | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-909 [Missing Initialization of Resource], as the root cause stems from failing to initialize the Soundwire stream runtime for the SC7280 card. This can lead to CWE-476 [NULL Pointer Dereference] when the uninitialized pointer is accessed, causing a crash. CWE-909 is a Class-level CWE, while CWE-476 is a Base-level CWE. The analysis prioritizes the root cause (missing initialization) over the impact (NULL pointer dereference).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe909[\"CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\"]\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n\n    cwe476 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe909\n    cwe476 -->|IMPACT| cwe909\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe909 primary\n    class cwe476 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing initialization** of the Soundwire stream runtime (CWE-909). This leads to the use of **uninitialized memory**, and subsequently a **NULL pointer dereference** (CWE-476) when the code attempts to access the uninitialized memory location, resulting in a crash. The root cause is the **failure to update the SC7280 card** driver with the necessary initialization code.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and keyphrase analysis. The description explicitly mentions the **\"forgot to update SC7280 card\"** which is a **ROOTCAUSE** and also the issue of **\"uninitialized memory\"** accesses, ultimately leading to a **\"NULL pointer dereference\"**.\n\nThe graph relationships and retriever results were used to prioritize CWE-909 [Missing Initialization of Resource] as the root cause. While CWE-476 [NULL Pointer Dereference] is a direct impact, the underlying issue is the failure to initialize the resource in the first place.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-909 is a Class-level CWE that accurately represents the missing initialization, and CWE-476 is a Base-level CWE that describes the resulting NULL pointer dereference. Choosing a more general CWE would lose the specific details of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   The vulnerability description clearly points to a **missing update** in the SC7280 card driver, which resulted in the **lack of initialization** for the Soundwire stream runtime. This directly aligns with CWE-909 [Missing Initialization of Resource].\n*   The impact of this **missing initialization** is a **NULL pointer dereference**, as stated in the vulnerability description. This aligns with CWE-476 [NULL Pointer Dereference].\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product obtains a value from an untrusted source, converts this value to a pointer, and dereferences the resulting pointer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
