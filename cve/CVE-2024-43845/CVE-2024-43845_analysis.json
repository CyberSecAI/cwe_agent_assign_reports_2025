  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved udf Fix bogus checksum computation in udf_rename() Syzbot reports **uninitialized memory access in udf_rename()** when updating checksum of .. directory entry of a moved directory. This is indeed true as we pass on-stack diriter.fi to the udf_update_tag() and because that has only struct fileIdentDesc included in it and not the impUse or name fields, the checksumming function is going to checksum random stack contents beyond the end of the structure. This is actually harmless because the following udf_fiiter_write_fi() will recompute the checksum from on-disk buffers where everything is properly included. So all that is needed is just removing the bogus calculation.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2024-43845.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from an incorrect checksum calculation within the `udf_rename()` function when updating the '..' directory entry of a moved directory. This occurs because the on-stack `diriter.fi` structure, passed to `udf_update_tag()`, only includes the `fileIdentDesc` and not the `impUse` or `name` fields. Consequently, `udf_update_tag()` checksums random stack memory contents beyond the structure's boundary.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Uninitialized memory access due to incorrect data being used in the checksum calculation.\n- Out-of-bounds read, as the checksum function accesses memory beyond the intended structure.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nWhile the incorrect checksum calculation is technically harmless as it's later recalculated correctly from on-disk buffers, it represents a potential vulnerability. The uninitialized memory access could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes under different circumstances or if the re-calculation didn't occur.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Triggering the `udf_rename()` function by renaming a directory in a UDF filesystem.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- Ability to perform file system operations on a UDF file system.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The provided patch removes the call to `udf_update_tag()` which is the source of the issue. The correct checksum will be calculated later using on disk data.\n- This vulnerability was reported by syzbot.\n- The fix is present in multiple stable kernel branches.",

While **CWE-665** is a broader category, **CWE-457** specifically addresses the use of an uninitialized variable, which aligns more precisely with the vulnerability description. **CWE-908 Use of Uninitialized Resource** and **CWE-824 Access of Uninitialized Pointer** are siblings to **CWE-457** under **CWE-665**, but the description explicitly mentions the use of the uninitialized memory.\n**CWE-125** is added as a secondary issue due to the checksum function accessing memory beyond the intended structure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe457[\"CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable\"]\n    cwe908[\"CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource\"]\n    cwe824[\"CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\"]\n    cwe665[\"CWE-665: Improper Initialization\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    \n    cwe457 -->|CHILDOF| cwe665\n    cwe908 -->|CHILDOF| cwe665\n    cwe824 -->|CHILDOF| cwe665\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe457 primary\n    class cwe908,cwe824,cwe125 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing initialization** of the `impUse` or `name` fields in the `diriter.fi` structure. This leads to **CWE-457 Use of Uninitialized Variable** because the checksum calculation uses this uninitialized memory. The checksumming function reads beyond the allocated structure (fileIdentDesc) leading to **CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read**. The impact is a bogus checksum computation, although it's later corrected.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary assessment is based on the vulnerability description and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\". The key phrase \"**uninitialized memory access in udf_rename()**\" points to the use of uninitialized data. The summary states \"the on-stack `diriter.fi` structure...only includes the `fileIdentDesc` and not the `impUse` or `name` fields. Consequently, `udf_update_tag()` checksums random stack memory contents beyond the structure's boundary.\" This confirms that uninitialized memory is being used in the checksum calculation. The retriever results also suggest **CWE-457**, **CWE-824 Access of Uninitialized Pointer**, and **CWE-908**.\n\n**CWE-457 Use of Uninitialized Variable** is selected as the primary CWE because it is the most specific description of the root cause. **CWE-908 Use of Uninitialized Resource** and **CWE-824 Access of Uninitialized Pointer** are closely related and could be considered, but **CWE-457** is preferred because it specifically describes the use of an uninitialized *variable*, which aligns with the details in the vulnerability description. **CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read** is included as a secondary issue as the checksum function reads beyond the allocated structure leading to an out-of-bounds memory read.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n**CWE-457**: The product uses a variable that has not been initialized, leading to predictable, and potentially sensitive, information.\n**CWE-125**: The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n**CWE-908**: The product uses or accesses a resource that has not been initialized.",
