  "description": "Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.7 and prior are vulnerable to **server-side request forgery** (SSRF) and **file write** in `model_download.py` (line 240 in 3.2.7). The **blind SSRF** allows for sending requests on behalf of Applio server and can be leveraged to probe for other vulnerabilities on the server itself or on other back-end systems on the internal network, that the Applio server can reach. The **blind SSRF** can also be coupled with the arbitrary file read CVE-2025-27784 to read files from hosts on the internal network, that the Applio server can reach, which would make it a full SSRF. The **file write** allows for writing files on the server, which can be coupled with other vulnerabilities, for example an **unsafe deserialization**, to achieve remote code execution on the Applio server. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.",

The `model_download.py` on line 240 uses a user-supplied URL through the endpoints on [download.py on line 194](https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/blob/29b4a00e4be209f9aac51cd9ccffcc632dfb2973/tabs/download/download.py#L192-L196) and [routes.py](https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/blob/29b4a00e4be209f9aac51cd9ccffcc632dfb2973/assets/flask/routes.py#L14), which leads to an HTTP GET request to arbitrary destinations in `model_download.py` on line 240. The vulnerability resides in the use of `wget.download(url)`.\n    *   **Impact of exploitation:** Blind server-side request forgery and file write. The SSRF allows sending requests on behalf of the Applio server, potentially probing for other vulnerabilities on the server or internal network. The file write allows writing files on the server, which could be combined with unsafe deserialization vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution.\n    *   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a malicious URL to the application through the download functionality.\n    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to control the URL provided to the vulnerable endpoints.\n    *   The content provides more detail than the official CVE description, including lines of code, file paths, and specific functions involved.",

The secondary issues are CWE-502, representing **unsafe deserialization**, and CWE-22, representing **file write** which can lead to path traversal. These weaknesses are related because the **SSRF** could be used to trigger the **deserialization** vulnerability, and the **file write** vulnerability allows for writing to arbitrary locations.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n\n    cwe502 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe918\n    cwe22 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe918\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe918 primary\n    class cwe502,cwe22 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **SSRF (CWE-918)**, which allows an attacker to send requests on behalf of the server. This can be coupled with **arbitrary file read (CWE-22)** to read files from internal hosts, or with **unsafe deserialization (CWE-502)** to achieve remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **server-side request forgery (SSRF)**, as indicated by the vulnerability description: \"Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.7 and prior are vulnerable to **server-side request forgery** (SSRF) and **file write** in `model_download.py` (line 240 in 3.2.7).\" This allows an attacker to send requests on behalf of the server. The presence of **unsafe deserialization** and **file write** issues enable further exploitation, such as remote code execution. The graph relationships show that **SSRF** is the entry point, while **deserialization** and **file write/path traversal** are subsequent steps in the attack chain.\n\nThe primary CWE, CWE-918, is chosen because it directly addresses the **SSRF** vulnerability. The secondary CWE, CWE-502, represents the **unsafe deserialization** aspect, which can be triggered by the **SSRF**. The other secondary CWE, CWE-22, represents the **file write** vulnerability. All are at the base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level.\n\nThe description also mentions that the **SSRF** can be coupled with the arbitrary file read CVE-2025-27784 to read files from hosts on the internal network, that the Applio server can reach, which would make it a full SSRF. The **file write** allows for writing files on the server, which can be coupled with other vulnerabilities, for example an **unsafe deserialization**, to achieve remote code execution on the Applio server.\n\nI considered CWE-611, CWE-923, and CWE-306, but they are not as directly relevant as CWE-918, CWE-502, and CWE-22. CWE-611 is specific to XML external entities, which is not mentioned in the description. CWE-923 is about restricting communication channels, which is related to SSRF but not as specific. CWE-306 is about missing authentication, which is not the primary issue here.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
