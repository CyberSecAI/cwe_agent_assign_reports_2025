# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Terminology]** 

Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.
- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).
- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-269 is commonly misused. It can be conflated with "privilege escalation," which is a technical impact that is listed in many low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis.
**Comments:** If an error or mistake allows privilege escalation, then use the CWE ID for that mistake. Avoid using CWE-269 when only phrases such as "privilege escalation" or "gain privileges" are available, as these indicate technical impact of the vulnerability - not the root cause weakness. If the root cause seems to be directly related to privileges, then examine the children of CWE-269 for additional hints, such as Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250) or Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266).
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2001-1555:** Terminal privileges are not reset when a user logs out.
- **CVE-2001-1514:** Does not properly pass security context to child processes in certain cases, allows privilege escalation.
- **CVE-2001-0128:** Does not properly compute roles.




## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.

### Extended Description
When a resource is given a permission setting that provides access to a wider range of actors than required, it could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, or the modification of that resource by unintended parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to program configuration, execution, or sensitive user data. For example, consider a misconfigured storage account for the cloud that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-285
ChildOf -> CWE-668

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which "permissions" are not checked, which is an "authorization" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse


### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.
- **CVE-2009-3482:** Anti-virus product sets insecure "Everyone: Full Control" permissions for files under the "Program Files" folder, allowing attackers to replace executables with Trojan horses.
- **CVE-2009-3897:** Product creates directories with 0777 permissions at installation, allowing users to gain privileges and access a socket used for authentication.




## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

### Extended Description


Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.


When access control checks are not applied consistently - or not at all - users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.


### Alternative Terms
AuthZ: "AuthZ" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authorization" within the web application security community. It is distinct from "AuthN" (or, sometimes, "AuthC") which is an abbreviation of "authentication." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-284
ChildOf -> CWE-284

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
**Comments:** Look at CWE-285's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-862: Missing Authorization, CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization, CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, or others.
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction
**Suggested Alternatives:**
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-24730:** Go-based continuous deployment product does not check that a user has certain privileges to update or create an app, allowing adversaries to read sensitive repository information
- **CVE-2009-3168:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to reset administrative passwords.
- **CVE-2009-2960:** Web application does not restrict access to admin scripts, allowing authenticated users to modify passwords of other users.




## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-287
ChildOf -> CWE-287

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-31260:** Chain: a digital asset management program has an undisclosed backdoor in the legacy version of a PHP script (CWE-912) that could allow an unauthenticated user to export metadata (CWE-306)
- **CVE-2022-29951:** TCP-based protocol in Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has no authentication.
- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.




## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-269
CanAlsoBe -> CWE-286

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-1999-1193:** untrusted user placed in unix "wheel" group
- **CVE-2005-2741:** Product allows users to grant themselves certain rights that can be used to escalate privileges.
- **CVE-2005-2496:** Product uses group ID of a user instead of the group, causing it to run with different privileges. This is resultant from some other unknown issue.




## CWE-648: Incorrect Use of Privileged APIs
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product does not conform to the API requirements for a function call that requires extra privileges. This could allow attackers to gain privileges by causing the function to be called incorrectly.

### Extended Description


When a product contains certain functions that perform operations requiring an elevated level of privilege, the caller of a privileged API must be careful to:


  - ensure that assumptions made by the APIs are valid, such as validity of arguments

  - account for known weaknesses in the design/implementation of the API

  - call the API from a safe context

If the caller of the API does not follow these requirements, then it may allow a malicious user or process to elevate their privilege, hijack the process, or steal sensitive data.

For instance, it is important to know if privileged APIs do not shed their privileges before returning to the caller or if the privileged function might make certain assumptions about the data, context or state information passed to it by the caller. It is important to always know when and how privileged APIs can be called in order to ensure that their elevated level of privilege cannot be exploited.


### Alternative Terms

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2003-0645:** A Unix utility that displays online help files, if installed setuid, could allow a local attacker to gain privileges when a particular file-opening function is called.




## CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product performs an operation at a privilege level that is higher than the minimum level required, which creates new weaknesses or amplifies the consequences of other weaknesses.

### Extended Description


New weaknesses can be exposed because running with extra privileges, such as root or Administrator, can disable the normal security checks being performed by the operating system or surrounding environment. Other pre-existing weaknesses can turn into security vulnerabilities if they occur while operating at raised privileges.


Privilege management functions can behave in some less-than-obvious ways, and they have different quirks on different platforms. These inconsistencies are particularly pronounced if you are transitioning from one non-root user to another. Signal handlers and spawned processes run at the privilege of the owning process, so if a process is running as root when a signal fires or a sub-process is executed, the signal handler or sub-process will operate with root privileges.

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Relationship]** There is a close association with CWE-653 (Insufficient Separation of Privileges). CWE-653 is about providing separate components for each privilege; CWE-250 is about ensuring that each component has the least amount of privileges possible.

**[Maintenance]** CWE-271, CWE-272, and CWE-250 are all closely related and possibly overlapping. CWE-271 is probably better suited as a category. Both CWE-272 and CWE-250 are in active use by the community. The "least privilege" phrase has multiple interpretations.

**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2007-4217:** FTP client program on a certain OS runs with setuid privileges and has a buffer overflow. Most clients do not need extra privileges, so an overflow is not a vulnerability for those clients.
- **CVE-2008-1877:** Program runs with privileges and calls another program with the same privileges, which allows read of arbitrary files.
- **CVE-2007-5159:** OS incorrectly installs a program with setuid privileges, allowing users to gain privileges.




## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-200
CanAlsoBe -> CWE-209

**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-0708:** Collaboration platform does not clear team emails in a response, allowing leak of email addresses




## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

### Extended Description


Resources such as files and directories may be inadvertently exposed through mechanisms such as insecure permissions, or when a program accidentally operates on the wrong object. For example, a program may intend that private files can only be provided to a specific user. This effectively defines a control sphere that is intended to prevent attackers from accessing these private files. If the file permissions are insecure, then parties other than the user will be able to access those files.


A separate control sphere might effectively require that the user can only access the private files, but not any other files on the system. If the program does not ensure that the user is only requesting private files, then the user might be able to access other files on the system.


In either case, the end result is that a resource has been exposed to the wrong party.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-664

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Discouraged
**Rationale:** CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.
**Comments:** Closely analyze the specific mistake that is allowing the resource to be exposed, and perform a CWE mapping for that mistake.
**Reasons:**
- Frequent Misuse
- Abstraction


### Additional Notes
**[Theoretical]** A "control sphere" is a set of resources and behaviors that are accessible to a single actor, or a group of actors. A product's security model will typically define multiple spheres, possibly implicitly. For example, a server might define one sphere for "administrators" who can create new user accounts with subdirectories under /home/server/, and a second sphere might cover the set of users who can create or delete files within their own subdirectories. A third sphere might be "users who are authenticated to the operating system on which the product is installed." Each sphere has different sets of actors and allowable behaviors.
