  "query": "A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in multiple [Vendor Name] products due to a business logic flaw in SOAP admin services. A malicious actor can create a new user with elevated permissions only when all of the following conditions are met * SOAP admin services are accessible to the attacker. * The deployment includes an internally used attribute that is not part of the default WSO2 product configuration. * At least one custom role exists with non-default permissions. * The attacker has knowledge of the custom role and the internal attribute used in the deployment. Exploiting this vulnerability allows malicious actors to assign higher privileges to self-registered users, bypassing intended access control mechanisms.",
