  "description": "A **privilege escalation vulnerability** exists in multiple [Vendor Name] products due to a **business logic flaw** in SOAP admin services. A malicious actor can create a new user with elevated permissions only when all of the following conditions are met * SOAP admin services are accessible to the attacker. * The deployment includes an internally used attribute that is not part of the default WSO2 product configuration. * At least one custom role exists with non-default permissions. * The attacker has knowledge of the custom role and the internal attribute used in the deployment. Exploiting this vulnerability allows malicious actors to assign higher privileges to self-registered users, bypassing intended access control mechanisms.",

While it is generally preferred to map to Base or Variant level CWEs, the specific nature of the **business logic flaw** causing an incorrect authorization check makes it a suitable choice. CWE-266, Incorrect Privilege Assignment, is a potential child of CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management and relates to the ability to create new users with elevated permissions.

This incorrect authorization allows a malicious actor to create new users with elevated permissions (CWE-266), resulting in a **privilege escalation vulnerability**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary focus is on the **business logic flaw** that leads to incorrect authorization. The vulnerability description clearly states that an attacker can create a new user with elevated permissions due to this flaw.\n\nThe vulnerability description provides the following evidence:\n\n*   \"A **privilege escalation vulnerability** exists...due to a **business logic flaw** in SOAP admin services.\"\n*   \"A malicious actor can create a new user with elevated permissions...\"\n\nCWE-863 is selected as the primary CWE because it represents the incorrect authorization check caused by the **business logic flaw**. CWE-266 is a secondary CWE because it describes the direct consequence of the incorrect authorization - the ability to assign elevated privileges. CWE-306 is included as a secondary CWE because the accessibility of SOAP admin services is a prerequisite for exploiting the vulnerability.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management - This is a high-level CWE and less specific than CWE-863 and CWE-266.\n*   CWE-285: Improper Authorization - Similar to CWE-863, but CWE-863 is more specific because it explicitly mentions that the authorization check is incorrect.\n*   CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function - While authentication might be missing, the primary issue is the flawed authorization logic, making CWE-863 more relevant.",
