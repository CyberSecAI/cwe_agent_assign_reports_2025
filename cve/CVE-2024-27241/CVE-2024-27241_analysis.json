This allows malicious or malformed network input to be processed by the application.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Denial of service (DoS). A successful exploit will cause a service disruption by making the Zoom application or service unavailable.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Network access. The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected application.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- Authenticated user. The attacker must have a valid account or be an authenticated user of Zoom.\n- Network access to the vulnerable application or service.\n\n**Affected Products:**\n- Zoom Workplace Desktop App for Windows, macOS, and Linux before version 6.0.0\n- Zoom Workplace VDI App for Windows before version 5.17.13\n- Zoom Workplace App for iOS and Android before version 6.0.0\n- Zoom Rooms App for Windows, Mac, and iPad before version 6.0.0\n- Zoom Meeting SDK for Windows, iOS, Android, macOS, and Linux before version 6.0.0",

CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) can be a contributing factor to DoS, as **improperly validated input** could lead to excessive resource allocation.\n\nCWE-20 (Root Cause) -> DoS (Impact, potentially caused by CWE-770)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed towards CWE-20, given the explicit mention of \"**Improper Input Validation**\" in the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. While CWE-20 is a Class-level CWE and typically discouraged, the lack of more specific information prevents a more granular mapping. The presence of a \"denial of service\" impact suggests CWE-770 as a potential secondary weakness, as **improperly validated input** could cause excessive resource allocation.\n\nThe decision is primarily based on the provided evidence, specifically the phrases \"**Improper input validation**\" and \"denial of service\". The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-770 can lead to resource exhaustion, which in turn causes denial of service.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity given the available information. While a more detailed analysis could potentially identify more precise CWEs, the current evidence supports CWE-20 as the primary **root cause** and CWE-770 as a potential contributing factor to the observed impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input or data, but it does\n        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the\n        properties that are required to process the data safely and\n        correctly.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287].
