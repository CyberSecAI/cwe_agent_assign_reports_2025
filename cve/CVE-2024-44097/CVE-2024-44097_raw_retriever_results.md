# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-44097
## Query
According to the researcher The TLS connections are encrypted against tampering or eavesdropping. However, the application does not validate the server certificate properly while initializing the TLS connection. This allows for a network attacker to intercept the connection and read the data. The attacker could the either send the client a malicious response, or forward the (possibly modified) data to the real server.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'improper server certificate validation'
