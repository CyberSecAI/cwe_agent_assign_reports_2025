  "query": "A10 Thunder ADC CsrRequestView Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of A10 Thunder ADC. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the CsrRequestView class. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of a10user. Was ZDI-CAN-22517.",
