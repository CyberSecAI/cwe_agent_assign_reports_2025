# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-30368

## Vulnerability Description
A10 Thunder ADC CsrRequestView Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of A10 Thunder ADC. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the CsrRequestView class. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call**. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of a10user. Was ZDI-CAN-22517.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call**
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **impact:** Remote Code Execution and execute arbitrary code
- **attacker:** remote attackers
- **product:** A10 Thunder ADC
- **component:** CsrRequestView class

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2024-30368:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `CsrRequestView` class of the A10 Thunder ADC's management GUI.
- The core issue is a lack of proper validation of user-supplied input before it's used in a system call. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code by inserting commands into the vulnerable input.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The system fails to properly sanitize or validate user input before using it to execute system calls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- **Initial Compromise:**  The attacker gains code execution with the privileges of the `a10user`.
- **Privilege Escalation:** When chained with CVE-2024-30369, the initial compromise can be used to achieve root privileges on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based Attack:** This is a remote attack vector, exploitable over the network.
- **Management GUI:** The vulnerability is located within the management GUI of A10 ACOS.
- **Specific Class:**  The vulnerability resides specifically in the `CsrRequestView` class.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with access to the management interface of the A10 system. This means they need to have valid credentials to log in.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the management interface of the A10 device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is not exposed via the data plane or the management console/CLI.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 7.2 (High).
- The vendor (A10 Networks) has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
- Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative identified and reported this issue.

In summary, CVE-2024-30368 allows an authenticated attacker with access to the A10 management GUI to inject commands due to insufficient input validation. This leads to remote code execution as `a10user`, which can then be escalated to `root` when combined with CVE-2024-30369.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
