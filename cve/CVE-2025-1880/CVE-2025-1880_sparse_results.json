The manipulation leads to authentication bypass by primary weakness. It is possible to launch the attack on the physical device. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. It was not possible to identify the current maintainer of the product. It must be assumed that the product is end-of-life.",
