  "description": "In the goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin there is a vulnerability that makes it possible to inject any custom message with any GID and Callsign using a software defined radio in existing goTenna mesh networks. This vulnerability can be exploited if the device is being used in an unencrypted environment or if the cryptography has already been compromised. It is advised to use encryption shared with local QR code for higher security operations.",

While it accurately reflects the vulnerability, it is a more general category. CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass by Spoofing) is a Base-level CWE and a child of a broader authentication weakness category, making it a more specific and potentially more accurate classification. CWE-941 (Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel) is also considered because the vulnerability involves injecting messages into the communication channel, but it is less directly related to the root cause of weak authentication.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe290[\"CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\"]\n    cwe941[\"CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\"]\n    \n    cwe290 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1390 primary\n    class cwe290,cwe941 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **weak authentication** (CWE-1390). Due to this weakness, an attacker can **spoof** messages (CWE-290) and inject them into the communication channel. This leads to the **impact** of injecting custom messages with any GID and Callsign. The chain is: CWE-1390 (Root Cause) -> CWE-290 (Exploitation) -> Impact (Message Injection).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **weak authentication** mechanism as the root cause. The provided information explicitly mentions **weak authentication** and the possibility of injecting messages with spoofed identities. The retriever results and graph relationships helped refine the selection, emphasizing the connection between **weak authentication** and the resulting ability to bypass authentication via spoofing.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1390 as the primary weakness is directly supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states, \"This vulnerability is listed as CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication).\" However, due to the possibility of using a software defined radio to inject messages, CWE-290 and CWE-941 are added as secondary weaknesses. These selections are at the optimal level of specificity as they accurately describe the vulnerability based on the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
