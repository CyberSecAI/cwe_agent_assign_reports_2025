CWE-78 is a specific type of injection related to OS commands, making it a more precise fit than the broader CWE-74. CWE-20 was considered given the lack of detail, but ultimately deemed too general.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe78 -->|PEEROF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of special elements within the input, leading to the ability to **inject commands**. The attacker crafts a POST request with malicious input. This input is then processed by the system without proper sanitization, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the operating system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is heavily reliant on the limited evidence provided in the vulnerability description, specifically the key phrases \"**impact:** inject commands\" and \"**vector:** specially-crafted post requests\". The lack of detail in the CVE Reference Links content summary impacts confidence in assigning a CWE.\n\nThe primary selection, CWE-78, is based on the direct statement of command injection being the impact. The graph relationships helped solidify this choice, showing it as a specific instance of a broader injection class.\n\nCWE-78 is chosen due to its specificity in describing OS command injection. While CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) could apply, it is too general and discouraged when more specific CWEs are available. The chosen CWE is at the optimal level of specificity given the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially
