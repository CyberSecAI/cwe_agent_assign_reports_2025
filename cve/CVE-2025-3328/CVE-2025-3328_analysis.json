  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Tenda AC1206 15.03.06.23. It has been classified as critical. Affected is the function form_fast_setting_wifi_set of the file /goform/fast_setting_wifi_set. The manipulation of the argument ssid/timeZone leads to **buffer overflow**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Other parameters might be affected as well.",

CWE-120 has a parent CWE of CWE-119, which is a Class level CWE. While CWE-119 broadly describes memory buffer issues, CWE-120 is more specific to buffer copies without size checking, aligning directly with the vulnerability description.

This leads to a **buffer overflow**, allowing an attacker to potentially overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **buffer overflow** caused by manipulating the `ssid` or `timeZone` arguments in the `form_fast_setting_wifi_set` function. The **root cause** is the **lack of size checking when copying data into a buffer**, which corresponds directly to CWE-120 \"Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\". The retriever results also suggested CWE-120 as one of the top candidates.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 3.65\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: There are some indications that this CWE ID might be misused and selected simply because it mentions \"buffer overflow\" - an increasingly vague term.
