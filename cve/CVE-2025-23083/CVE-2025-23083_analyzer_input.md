# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-23083

## Vulnerability Description
With the aid of the diagnostics_channel utility, an event can be hooked into whenever a worker thread is created. This is not limited only to workers but also exposes internal workers, where an instance of them can be fetched, and its constructor can be grabbed and reinstated for malicious usage. This vulnerability affects Permission Model users (--permission) on Node.js v20, v22, and v23.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **expose internal workers**
- **impact:** grab constructor and reinstate for malicious usage
- **product:** Node.js
- **version:** v20 and v22 and and v23

## Analysis of CVE-2025-23083 based on provided content:

The provided content **is relevant** to CVE-2025-23083. It provides detailed information about the vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a worker permission bypass via an InternalWorker leak in diagnostics. An event can be hooked into whenever a worker thread is created, exposing internal workers. An instance of these internal workers can be fetched, and its constructor can be grabbed and reinstated for malicious usage.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Worker permission bypass
*   InternalWorker leak in diagnostics
*   Improper access control

**Impact of exploitation:**

The vulnerability affects Permission Model users (--permission) on Node.js v20, v22, and v23. It affects all users in active release lines: 20.x, 22.x, 23.x.

**Attack vectors:**

Exploitation involves using the `diagnostics_channel` utility to hook into worker thread creation events, gaining access to internal workers, and reinstating their constructors for malicious purposes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

The content does not specify the required attacker capabilities or position.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content indicates that updates are available for the 23.x, 22.x, 20.x, and 18.x Node.js release lines to address this issue.  The fix was implemented by RafaelGSS.

**Additional details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability was reported by leodog896.
*   The content provides specific version numbers affected (v20, v22, v23).
*   It clarifies that the vulnerability impacts users utilizing the Permission Model.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| “Escalate to root/admin”                    | Privilege escalation impact           | Not CWE-269! Use root cause (e.g., 266, 250) |
| “Assigned wrong role/group”                 | Misassigned privilege                 | CWE-266                                      |
| “Runs as root” or “Should not run as admin” | Over-privileged execution             | CWE-250                                      |
| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
