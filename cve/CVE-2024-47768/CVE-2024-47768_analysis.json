  "description": "Lif Authentication Server is a server used by Lif to do various tasks regarding Lif accounts. This vulnerability has to do with the account recovery system where there does not appear to be a check to make sure the user has been sent the recovery email and entered the correct code. If the attacker knew the email of the target, they could supply the email and immediately prompt the server to update the password without ever needing the code. This issue has been patched in version 1.7.3.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content contains information about CVE-2024-47768.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authentication checks within the account recovery system. Specifically, there isn't a check to verify if the user has actually received the recovery email and entered the correct code before allowing a password reset.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Missing authentication check in the password reset process.\n- The server allows password updates after receiving only an email address, without verifying the code sent to that address.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nAn attacker who knows the email address of a target user can exploit this vulnerability to change the target's password without needing to access their email or the recovery code. This would result in unauthorized account access.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The attacker needs to know the email of the target user.\n- The attacker would then use the `/account/recovery` websocket endpoint to initiate the password reset.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to know the email of the target user\n- The attacker needs network access to send requests to the vulnerable server.",

CWE-640 was also considered as a child of CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication), however, the vulnerability is not specifically related to a \"forgotten password\" scenario, making CWE-306 a better fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe640[\"CWE-640: Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe640 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    cwe306 -->|PEEROF| cwe640\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe640 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing check for recovery email and code** (**ROOTCAUSE**) which allows an attacker to update the password without needing the code (**IMPACT**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided evidence, which clearly indicates a **missing authentication check** in the account recovery system. The vulnerability description states, \"there does not appear to be a check to make sure the user has been sent the recovery email and entered the correct code.\" This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.\n\nThe selection of CWE-306 is further supported by the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" which highlights the **root cause** as \"a lack of proper authentication checks within the account recovery system.\" The impact of this weakness is that \"an attacker who knows the email address of a target user can exploit this vulnerability to change the target's password without needing to access their email or the recovery code.\"\n\nThe relationship analysis shows that CWE-306 is a base CWE, providing an appropriate level of specificity for the vulnerability.
