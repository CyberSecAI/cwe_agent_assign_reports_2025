## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-25452 Content

This content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2025-25452. It provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the use of the SHA-1 hashing algorithm for storing user passwords. SHA-1 is considered cryptographically broken and vulnerable to collision attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Insecure password storage: Passwords are hashed using SHA-1, a weak and outdated hashing algorithm.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation could allow attackers to compromise user accounts if they can find collisions for the SHA-1 hashes of passwords.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Collision attacks against the SHA-1 hashes.
*   Rainbow table attacks (though SHA-1 is still somewhat resistant to this, it's less secure than modern algorithms).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to obtain the SHA-1 hashes of user passwords (e.g., through a data breach or API access).
*   The attacker needs computational resources to perform collision attacks or access to precomputed rainbow tables.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Migrate to a stronger password hashing algorithm such as bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2.
*   Salt the passwords before hashing them to further increase security.
*   Implement proper key stretching to make brute-force attacks more difficult.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set ‚Äì Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* üîç *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* üîç *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion ‚Äì CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### üî∏ CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúA user created with the ‚Äòguest‚Äô role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúThe backup service runs as root but only needs read access.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### üî∏ CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúUser can access another user‚Äôs invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.‚Äù*

## Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *‚ÄúUser can escalate privileges to admin.‚Äù*
> ‚ùå Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged ‚Äì only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ‚úÖ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**
