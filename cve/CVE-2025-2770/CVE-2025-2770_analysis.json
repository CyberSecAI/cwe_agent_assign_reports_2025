CWE-257 is a child of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), illustrating a broader category of credential protection issues. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) represents the impact of the vulnerability, but it is a class-level CWE and discouraged for direct mapping when a more specific root cause is identifiable. The relationships influenced the decision to prioritize CWE-257 as the root cause and consider CWE-200 as a potential secondary impact.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe257[\"CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe257 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe200 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe257\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe257 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe522 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-257 (Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format)**, the **root cause**, leading to the impact of **CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor)**. The passwords being stored in a recoverable format allows remote attackers to disclose the sensitive information, leading to further compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which explicitly states that the **root cause** of the vulnerability is storing credentials in a recoverable format within the web-based user interface. The vulnerability description key phrases also highlight \"**cleartext password storage**\" as a **rootcause**.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-257 (Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format) as a possible match. CWE-257 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred, and the mapping guidance allows for its usage.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was also considered, but it is a class-level CWE and is discouraged for direct mapping when a more specific root cause is identifiable. The relationship graph shows that CWE-200 can follow CWE-257, indicating that it is a potential impact of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-257 representing the **root cause** and CWE-200 representing the impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users.
