## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap buffer overflow in `movDemuxer.cpp` due to unbounded increment of `num_tracks` when parsing a crafted MOV file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The code lacks proper bounds checking when creating new tracks in the `tracks` array. The `num_tracks` variable is incremented without checking if it exceeds the `MAX_STREAMS` limit.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A heap buffer overflow can lead to a crash (as observed), memory corruption, and potentially arbitrary code execution. The report explicitly states "This heap buffer overflow is exploitable"
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted MOV file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious MOV file to the vulnerable application.
