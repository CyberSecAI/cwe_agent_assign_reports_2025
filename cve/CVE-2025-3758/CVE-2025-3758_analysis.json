Here's an extraction of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe Netis Systems WF2220 device exposes an endpoint (`/cgi-bin-igd/netcore_get.cgi`) that returns the device's configuration to unauthorized users.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306)\n*   Exposure of sensitive information (cleartext password)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Exposure of device configuration, including the administrator password in plaintext.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Access to the `/cgi-bin-igd/netcore_get.cgi` endpoint. No authentication is required.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Network access to the vulnerable device. No special privileges are needed.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The content does not specify a fix, but implies that authentication should be implemented for access to the `/cgi-bin-igd/netcore_get.cgi` endpoint.\n*   The vendor (Netis Systems) has not responded to the report, so no patch is currently available.\n\nThe content also mentions CVE-2025-3759, which is a related vulnerability in the same product, but focuses on the `/cgi-bin-igd/netcore_set.cgi` endpoint allowing unauthorized configuration changes.",

The root cause is the lack of authentication for a critical function. |\n| CWE-256 | Plaintext Storage of Passwords | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The impact of the vulnerability includes the exposure of the password stored in plaintext.|\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the child-parent relationship between CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function and other related authentication weaknesses. CWE-306 represents the core issue. The exposure of the cleartext password is the impact of the missing authentication in CWE-306.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of Passwords\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe256\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe256,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** for a critical function (CWE-306). This **leads to** the exposure of device configuration, including a **plaintext password** (CWE-256), which **results in** the exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized actors.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference links. The key phrase \"exposes endpoint /cgi-bin-igd/netcore_get.cgi that returns configuration of the device to unauthorized users\" strongly suggests CWE-306. The fact that the \"Returned configuration includes cleartext password\" indicates a secondary weakness related to password storage, specifically CWE-256.\n\nThe retriever results also support this conclusion, with CWE-306 being the top candidate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-306 and CWE-256 is at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause and impact of the vulnerability, respectively. CWE-306 describes the fundamental **lack of security control**, while CWE-256 details the consequence of **storing credentials in a vulnerable manner**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced
