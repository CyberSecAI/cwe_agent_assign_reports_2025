# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-3418

## Vulnerability Description
The WPC Admin Columns plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions 2.0.6 to 2.1.0. This is due to the **plugin not properly restricting user meta values that can be updated through the ajax_edit_save() function**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update their role to that of an administrator.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **plugin not properly restricting user meta values that can be updated through the ajax_edit_save() function**
- **impact:** privilege escalation
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers
- **product:** WPC Admin Columns plugin for WordPress
- **version:** versions 2.0.6 to 2.1.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, it appears to relate to a permission check vulnerability. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The code was modified to include permission checks before allowing updates to term, user, and post fields. Prior to this change, it seems these updates were performed without verifying if the current user had the necessary permissions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Missing authorization checks. The original code lacked checks to ensure that users had the appropriate permissions (e.g., `edit_term`, `edit_users`, `edit_post`) before modifying data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker with sufficient privileges could potentially modify terms, users, or posts without proper authorization, leading to data manipulation or privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
Exploitation would involve sending requests to update term, user, or post fields without having the required permissions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the affected endpoint. The level of privilege required to initially send the request is not specified, but the vulnerability lies in the lack of checks *before* the update is processed.

**Mitigation or fix:**
The changeset introduces permission checks using `current_user_can()` before allowing updates to term, user, and post fields. If the user lacks the necessary permission, the script terminates with a "Permissions check failed!" message.

**More detail than official CVE description:**
Yes, the content provides specific code snippets demonstrating the added permission checks, which is more detailed than a typical CVE description.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| “Escalate to root/admin”                    | Privilege escalation impact           | Not CWE-269! Use root cause (e.g., 266, 250) |
| “Assigned wrong role/group”                 | Misassigned privilege                 | CWE-266                                      |

| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
