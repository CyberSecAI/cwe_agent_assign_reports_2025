  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved iommu/amd Fix potential **buffer overflow** in parse_ivrs_acpihid There is a **string parsing logic error** which can lead to an overflow of hid or uid buffers. Comparing ACPIID_LEN against a total string length doesnt take into account the lengths of individual hid and uid buffers so the check is insufficient in some cases. For example if the length of hid string is 4 and the length of the uid string is 260, the length of str will be equal to ACPIID_LEN + 1 but uid string will overflow uid buffer which size is 256. The same applies to the hid string with length 13 and uid string with length 250. Check the length of hid and uid strings separately to prevent **buffer overflow**. Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",

CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') is a consequence of the improper handling of the length parameter. CWE-130 can precede CWE-805 and it is related to CWE-119 through the child-of relationship. CWE-120 is a parent of CWE-785.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe130[\"CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe805[\"CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\"]\n    cwe785[\"CWE-785: Use of Path Manipulation Function without Maximum Length Check\"]\n\n    cwe130 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe805\n    cwe130 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|PARENTOF| cwe785\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe130 primary\n    class cwe120 secondary\n    class cwe119,cwe805,cwe785 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **string parsing logic error** (CWE-130), where the lengths of the hid and uid strings are not properly validated. This leads to a **buffer overflow** (CWE-120) when copying these strings into their respective buffers.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment based on the vulnerability description and retriever results points to a **buffer overflow** due to a **string parsing logic error**. The primary cause is the **improper handling of length parameters** (CWE-130). The vulnerability description explicitly mentions that the check is insufficient because it doesn't take into account the lengths of individual hid and uid buffers. This aligns with CWE-130, where the product does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description: \"Comparing ACPIID_LEN against a total string length doesnt take into account the lengths of individual hid and uid buffers so the check is insufficient in some cases. For example if the length of hid string is 4 and the length of the uid string is 260, the length of str will be equal to ACPIID_LEN + 1 but uid string will overflow uid buffer which size is 256.\" supports this.\n\nCWE-130 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately describes the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the incorrect handling of length parameters during string parsing.\nCWE-120 is added because the result of the incorrect handling is a **buffer overflow**, though this is a consequence of the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*   **Why it was considered but not used**: While related to buffer overflows, the issue isn't an incorrect calculation of the buffer size itself, but rather an incorrect handling of the length of the input being copied into the buffer.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*   **Why it was considered but not used**: Integer underflow is not the primary issue.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*   **Why it was considered but not used**: This is not the case as the logic **error** is in how the lengths are handled and it's more than one off.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*   **Why it was considered but not used**: While this is a consequence, the **root cause** is the improper handling of the length parameter inconsistency.\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary.
