  "description": "In mintplex-labs/anything-llm versions up to and including 1.5.3, an issue was discovered where the password hash of a user is returned in the response after login (`POST /api/request-token`) and after account creations (`POST /api/admin/users/new`). This exposure occurs because the entire User object, including the bcrypt password hash, is included in the response sent to the frontend. This practice could potentially lead to **sensitive information exposure** despite the use of bcrypt, a strong hashing algorithm. It is recommended not to expose any clues about passwords to the frontend.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the changes made in the commit `9df4521113ddb9a3adb5d0e3941e7d494992629c` which is relevant to CVE-2024-5213:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the exposure of sensitive user data, specifically password hashes, when retrieving user information. The original code in `server/endpoints/admin.js` and `server/endpoints/api/admin/index.js` was directly returning the entire user object, including the `password` field.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of password hashes to unauthorized users. Even if the hashes are securely stored, disclosing them increases the risk of offline attacks like brute-forcing or rainbow table lookups, which could lead to account compromise.\n- **Lack of Proper Data Sanitization:** The code was not filtering out sensitive information when returning user data.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- An attacker who gains access to the exposed user data, particularly the password hashes, could potentially compromise user accounts through offline attacks.\n- This can lead to unauthorized access to the application, data breaches, and other malicious activities.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by making requests to the admin endpoints that are intended to return user data.\n- If the attacker has compromised admin or manager privileges this would be an easier attack vector, but a vulnerability in the authentication process or an exposed endpoint could lead to the same result.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- The attacker would need to have the ability to make API requests to the affected endpoints (`/admin/users` or `/api/admin/users`) that return user data.\n- The attacker would need to have or find a way to bypass authorization to access the data.\n\n**Mitigation:**\n\nThe commit `9df4521113ddb9a3adb5d0e3941e7d494992629c` addresses this vulnerability by implementing the following changes:\n\n- **Filtering Sensitive Data:** Introduced a `filterFields` function in `server/models/user.js` that removes the `password` field from the user object before it's returned. This function is now called whenever user data is returned by the API.\n- **Modified Endpoints:** Updated `server/endpoints/admin.js`, `server/endpoints/api/admin/index.js` and `server/endpoints/system.js` to use the new `filterFields` function to remove the password from the user data before it is returned in responses.\n\n**Summary of Changes:**\n\n- Modification of `admin.js`, `index.js` and `system.js` to properly filter the user object before returning it.\n- Introduction of a `filterFields` function in `user.js` model.\n- Modification of the `create` user function to use the `filterFields` function.\n- Modification of the `get` and `where` user functions to use the `filterFields` function.\n\nThis commit effectively mitigates the risk of password hash exposure by ensuring the password field is never included in the returned user data.",

While CWE-319 and CWE-532 were considered due to their relevance to data transmission and storage, CWE-201 was chosen as the most specific fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    \n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe201\n    cwe319 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe201\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe319,cwe532 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the inclusion of the password hash in the user object, leading to its transmission in the API response. The root cause is the **insertion of sensitive information** (password hash) into the data being sent. The sequence can be mapped as:\n\n1.  **Sensitive Data Inclusion:** User object created containing the password hash.\n2.  **Data Transmission:** User object (including the password hash) is sent in the API response.\n3.  **Information Exposure:** Password hash exposed to the frontend.\n\nThe primary weakness is CWE-201, which is the **insertion of sensitive information** into sent data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-201 as the primary candidate due to the direct exposure of sensitive information via API responses. The commit details in the CVE reference confirm that the **password hash was being included in the returned user object**, leading to the vulnerability.\n\nThe graph relationships support the choice of CWE-201 due to its direct relevance to the **insertion of sensitive information** into data being sent. While CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission) and CWE-532 (Insertion into Log File) were considered, they were deemed less accurate because the primary issue was the inclusion of the sensitive data itself, rather than the transmission channel or storage location.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause, which is the inclusion of the password hash in the response.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-916: Use of
