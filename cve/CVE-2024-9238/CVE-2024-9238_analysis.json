The plugin allows unrestricted upload of SVG files. Because these files aren't sanitized, they can contain malicious **XSS** payloads.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    \n    cwe79 <--|CANFOLLOW| cwe434\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe434 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **unrestricted upload of a file with a dangerous type** (CWE-434). This leads to the **improper neutralization of input during web page generation** (CWE-79), resulting in cross-site scripting.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the evidence that the AVIF Uploader WordPress plugin before 1.1.1 does not sanitize uploaded SVG files, allowing users with author roles to upload malicious SVG files containing **XSS** payloads.\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary section explicitly states: \"The plugin does not sanitize uploaded SVG files.\" It also identifies \"Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Stored XSS\" as a weakness and specifies \"CWE: CWE-79\".\n\nThe retriever results also support CWE-79 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-434 [Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type] is considered a secondary CWE because the root cause is the lack of sanitization of the uploaded SVG file.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the vulnerability. CWE-79 describes the **XSS** vulnerability, while CWE-434 describes the mechanism by which the malicious SVG file is uploaded.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
