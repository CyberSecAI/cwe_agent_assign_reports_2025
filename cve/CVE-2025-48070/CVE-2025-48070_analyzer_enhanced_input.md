## Vulnerability Description
Plane is open-source project management software. Versions prior to 0.23 have **insecure permissions in UserSerializer** that allows users to change fields that are meant to be read-only, such as email. This can lead to account takeover when chained with another vulnerability such as **cross-site scripting** (XSS). Version 0.23 fixes the issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insecure permissions in UserSerializer**
- **weakness:** **cross-site scripting**
- **impact:** account takeover
- **product:** Plane
- **version:** prior to 0.23

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-48070 based on provided content:

The provided content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2025-48070. It details a vulnerability in the `plane` application. Here's an extraction of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

Insecure permissions in `UserSerializer` allow users to modify fields (like email) that should be read-only.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Insecure permissions
*   Lack of proper input validation/sanitization (allowing arbitrary email modification)

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   User can modify their email address.
*   Potential for account takeover when chained with other vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Attack vectors:**

*   Network - An attacker can send a PATCH request over the network.
*   Directly sending a PATCH request to the `/api/users/me` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Low privileges - Requires a logged-in user account.
*   User interaction is required - The attacker needs to be a user of the application.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The vulnerability was patched in version 0.23.  Updating to version 0.23 or later is recommended.
*   A commit (0a8cc24) adds validation fields in users, including `is_email_valid` and `masked_at`, which likely contribute to the fix.

**CVSS Score:**

*   Overall Score: 3.5 / 10
*   CVSS v3 base metrics: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The content provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) showing how to change the email address using a PATCH request with a JSON body: `{"email":"abdullah@attacker.com"}`.
*   The commit details show the addition of `is_email_valid` (BooleanField, default=False) and `masked_at` (DateTimeField, null=True) to the User model, suggesting these fields are part of the mitigation.
*   The vulnerability was reported by i4bdullah.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set ‚Äì Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* üîç *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* üîç *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion ‚Äì CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### üî∏ CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúA user created with the ‚Äòguest‚Äô role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúThe backup service runs as root but only needs read access.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### üî∏ CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúUser can access another user‚Äôs invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.‚Äù*

## Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *‚ÄúUser can escalate privileges to admin.‚Äù*
> ‚ùå Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged ‚Äì only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ‚úÖ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

* ‚úÖ **CWE-266**: *‚ÄúWhen a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.‚Äù*
* ‚úÖ **CWE-250**: *‚ÄúInstaller runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.‚Äù*
* ‚úÖ **CWE-284**: *‚ÄúInconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.‚Äù*
* ‚úÖ **CWE-285**: *‚ÄúAuthorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.‚Äù*
