  "description": "Plane is open-source project management software. Versions prior to 0.23 have **insecure permissions in UserSerializer** that allows users to change fields that are meant to be read-only, such as email. This can lead to account takeover when chained with another vulnerability such as **cross-site scripting** (XSS). Version 0.23 fixes the issue.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-48070 based on provided content:\n\nThe provided content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2025-48070. It details a vulnerability in the `plane` application. Here's an extraction of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nInsecure permissions in `UserSerializer` allow users to modify fields (like email) that should be read-only.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Insecure permissions\n*   Lack of proper input validation/sanitization (allowing arbitrary email modification)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   User can modify their email address.\n*   Potential for account takeover when chained with other vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Network - An attacker can send a PATCH request over the network.\n*   Directly sending a PATCH request to the `/api/users/me` endpoint.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Low privileges - Requires a logged-in user account.\n*   User interaction is required - The attacker needs to be a user of the application.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was patched in version 0.23.  Updating to version 0.23 or later is recommended.\n*   A commit (0a8cc24) adds validation fields in users, including `is_email_valid` and `masked_at`, which likely contribute to the fix.\n\n**CVSS Score:**\n\n*   Overall Score: 3.5 / 10\n*   CVSS v3 base metrics: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The content provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) showing how to change the email address using a PATCH request with a JSON body: `{\"email\":\"abdullah@attacker.com\"}`.\n*   The commit details show the addition of `is_email_valid` (BooleanField, default=False) and `masked_at` (DateTimeField, null=True) to the User model, suggesting these fields are part of the mitigation.\n*   The vulnerability was reported by i4bdullah.",

This is then chained with a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79) which leads to account takeover.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the **rootcause** of the vulnerability. The description clearly states that the **\"insecure permissions in UserSerializer\"** is the primary issue, making CWE-266 the most appropriate. The vulnerability is then chained with XSS, so CWE-79 is added as a secondary vulnerability.\nThe final selection is based on the provided evidence and the specific descriptions of each CWE, ensuring that the selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
