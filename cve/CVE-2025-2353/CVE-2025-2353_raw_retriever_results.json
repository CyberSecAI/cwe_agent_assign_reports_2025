Affected is an unknown function of the file /vam/index.php of the component HTTP GET Parameter Handler. The manipulation of the argument ID/registry_id/plane_icao leads to sql injection. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Other parameters might be affected as well. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
