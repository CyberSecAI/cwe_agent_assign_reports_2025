Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file /read/?page=1&logfile=eee&match=. The manipulation of the argument path leads to os **command injection**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This product does not use versioning. This is why information about affected and unaffected releases are unavailable.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-1229 Content (PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval)\n\nThe provided content **relates** to a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Loggrove system. It provides detailed information about the vulnerability, exceeding the level of detail typically found in a standard CVE description.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of user input in the `read.py` file. Specifically, the application allows special characters like the concatenation symbol '&' (and its URL-encoded equivalent '%26') to be included in user-supplied input.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Improper Input Validation:** Lack of sufficient input sanitization allows for the injection of shell commands.\n*   **Command Injection:** The ability to concatenate commands using '&' enables arbitrary command execution on the system.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server running the Loggrove application. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL (payload) that includes the vulnerable parameter (`path`) and the command to be executed.\n*   The payload is sent to the `/read/` endpoint of the Loggrove application.\n*   Example payload: `http://192.168.20.131:8000/read/?page=1&logfile=eee&match=&path=/var/log/yum.log%26%26ifconfig&host=localhost&clean=true&posit=head`\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to access the Loggrove application via HTTP/HTTPS.\n*   No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, as demonstrated by the steps involving logging in and then exploiting the vulnerability.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The content does not explicitly state a fix, but it implies that proper input sanitization in the `read.py` file is necessary to prevent the vulnerability.  Specifically, the application should validate and sanitize the `path` parameter to prevent the inclusion of shell metacharacters.",
