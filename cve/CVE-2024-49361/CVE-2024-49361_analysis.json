  "description": "ACON is a widely-used library of tools for machine learning that focuses on adaptive correlation optimization. A potential vulnerability has been identified in the input validation process, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited. This issue could allow an attacker to submit malicious input data, bypassing input validation, resulting in remote code execution in certain machine learning applications using the ACON library. All users utilizing ACONs input-handling functions are potentially at risk. Specifically, machine learning models or applications that ingest user-generated data without proper sanitization are the most vulnerable. Users running ACON on production servers are at heightened risk, as the vulnerability could be exploited remotely. As of time of publication, it is unclear whether a fix is available.",

While more specific CWEs like CWE-129 [CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index] or CWE-95 [CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')] were considered, the provided information doesn't give enough context to pinpoint the exact type of input validation failure. Therefore, while discouraged, CWE-20 [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation] is the most appropriate high-level classification. CWE-95 [CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')] is a possible secondary candidate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe95[\"CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe95 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe95 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20 [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation]), which allows **malicious input data** to bypass checks.
