## Vulnerability Description
ACON is a widely-used library of tools for machine learning that focuses on adaptive correlation optimization. A potential vulnerability has been identified in the input validation process, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited. This issue could allow an attacker to submit malicious input data, bypassing input validation, resulting in remote code execution in certain machine learning applications using the ACON library. All users utilizing ACONs input-handling functions are potentially at risk. Specifically, machine learning models or applications that ingest user-generated data without proper sanitization are the most vulnerable. Users running ACON on production servers are at heightened risk, as the vulnerability could be exploited remotely. As of time of publication, it is unclear whether a fix is available.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **vulnerability in input validation process**
- **impact:** arbitrary code execution and remote code execution
- **vector:** malicious input data
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** ACON

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the ACON library's input-handling functions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper sanitization of user-generated data. Specifically, insufficient validation allows malicious input data to bypass checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution on systems using the ACON library, potentially leading to remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Submitting malicious input data to the ACON library.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the machine learning application using the ACON library. This could be through a network, or via other ways to interact with the application. Specifically, applications that ingest user-generated data without proper sanitization are the most vulnerable.
