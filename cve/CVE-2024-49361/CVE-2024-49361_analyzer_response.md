| CWE-95 | Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection') | 0.6 | Variant |  | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the parent-child relationship between CWE-20 [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation] and its potential children. While more specific CWEs like CWE-129 [CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index] or CWE-95 [CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')] were considered, the provided information doesn't give enough context to pinpoint the exact type of input validation failure. Therefore, while discouraged, CWE-20 [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation] is the most appropriate high-level classification. CWE-95 [CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')] is a possible secondary candidate.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20 [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation]), which allows **malicious input data** to bypass checks. This leads to **arbitrary code execution** and potentially **remote code execution**.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified **improper input validation** as the root cause, aligning with the description in the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" and "CVE Reference Links Content Summary". The Retriever Results also highlighted CWE-20 [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation] as a potential candidate. The final decision favors CWE-20 [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation] as the primary CWE due to the lack of specific details about the type of input validation failure. While CWE-20 [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation] is discouraged, the evidence is insufficient to choose a more specific child CWE. Further investigation would be needed to determine the exact nature of the input validation issues and select a more precise CWE.
CWE-95 [CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')] is considered a possible secondary weakness that could occur due to **improper input validation** that results in the ability to inject directives into dynamically evaluated code.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives a complex input with multiple elements or fields that must be consistent with each other, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is actually consistent.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 720.64
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
