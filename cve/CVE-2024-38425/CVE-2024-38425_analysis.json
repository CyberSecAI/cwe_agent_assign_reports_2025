The selection of CWE-200 as the primary CWE and CWE-927 as a secondary candidate reflects this hierarchical structure. The graph relationships did not greatly influence the decision here as the vulnerability description does not provide enough information to make a specific determination of rootcause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe927[\"CWE-927: Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication\"]\n    \n    cwe927 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe927 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with sending an implicit broadcast containing app launch information, leading to the **impact** of information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and impact of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description states \"Information disclosure while sending implicit broadcast containing APP launch information.\" This directly points to CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) as the primary issue, since the fundamental problem is that sensitive information is being exposed. The \"implicit broadcast\" part of the description leads to considering CWE-927 (Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication) as a secondary, more specific issue.\n\nThe decision to prioritize CWE-200 is based on its direct relevance to the **impact** described. However, the implicit broadcast mechanism suggests a more granular weakness related to how the information is being sent, thus the inclusion of CWE-927. The abstraction levels were considered, and while a more specific CWE would be ideal, the available information only strongly supports the class-level CWE-200 with the variant CWE-927.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-927: Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive
