# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-46625

## Description

**Lack of input validation/sanitization** in the setLanCfg API endpoint in httpd in the Tenda RX2 Pro 16.03.30.14 allows a remote attacker that is authorized to the web management portal to gain root shell access to the device by sending a crafted web request. This is persistent because the **command injection** is saved in the configuration of the device.

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The root cause is a **lack of input validation/sanitization** leading to **command injection**. |
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. The **lack of input validation/sanitization** is a general case of **improper input validation**. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-78, which is a Base level weakness describing OS command injection. CWE-78 is a specific type of injection vulnerability. CWE-20 is a Class level weakness describing improper input validation. CWE-20 is a parent of more specific input validation flaws and can often precede other weaknesses. CWE-78 is a specific case of CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')), and both are related to CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')).

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **lack of input validation/sanitization** (CWE-20) which leads to OS command injection (CWE-78). The attacker crafts a web request to exploit this **lack of input validation**, resulting in root shell access. The **command injection** is saved in the configuration, making it persistent.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability is caused by a **lack of input validation/sanitization** in the setLanCfg API endpoint, which allows a remote attacker to perform OS command injection. The most specific CWE to represent this vulnerability is CWE-78.

The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Lack of input validation/sanitization** in the setLanCfg API endpoint...allows a remote attacker...to gain root shell access to the device by sending a crafted web request. This is persistent because the **command injection** is saved in the configuration of the device."

CWE-78 is the most appropriate because it directly addresses the **command injection** vulnerability. CWE-20 is a broader category, and while it's related, CWE-78 provides a more precise classification.

CWE-77 was considered, but CWE-78 is more specific as it explicitly mentions OS commands. CWE-74 was also considered, but it is too general, as it refers to any kind of injection and is discouraged.
The evidence provided supports the selection of CWE-78 as the primary CWE with high confidence. CWE-20 is a secondary CWE representing the **lack of input validation/sanitization**, which is the root cause.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.
