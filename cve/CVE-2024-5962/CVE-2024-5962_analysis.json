  "description": "A reflected **cross-site scripting** (XSS) vulnerability exists in the authentication endpoint of multiple WSO2 products due to **missing output encoding of user-supplied input**. A malicious actor can exploit this vulnerability to inject arbitrary JavaScript into the authentication flow, potentially leading to UI modifications, redirections to malicious websites, or data exfiltration from the browser. While this issue could allow an attacker to manipulate the users browser, session-related sensitive cookies remain protected with the httpOnly flag, preventing session hijacking.",

CWE-79 is a more specific case of CWE-116, focusing on XSS vulnerabilities, which aligns with the vulnerability description. There's also a chain relationship where **improper encoding (CWE-116)** can lead to **cross-site scripting (CWE-79)**. The base level of CWE-79 makes it suitable for direct mapping.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe116\n    cwe116 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe116 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing output encoding of user-supplied input**, which is the root cause. This leads to **improper neutralization of input** and results in a **cross-site scripting vulnerability**. The chain progresses as follows:\n1.  **Missing output encoding of user-supplied input**\n2.  **Improper neutralization (CWE-116)**\n3.  **Cross-site scripting (CWE-79)**, allowing for UI modifications, redirections, or data exfiltration.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the \"**missing output encoding of user-supplied input**\" phrase, which directly points to an encoding issue. The retriever results also prioritize CWE-79 and CWE-116, supporting this conclusion. The relationship graph helps to contextualize the vulnerability within a broader class of encoding/escaping issues.\n\nThe selection of CWE-79 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the XSS vulnerability resulting from the improper neutralization. CWE-116 is considered as a broader classification, but the description provides enough detail to pinpoint XSS as the main issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
