  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the H2 database connection string within the DataEase application. Specifically, the application allows user-provided input to be directly incorporated into the JDBC connection string without proper validation or escaping, which allows execution of arbitrary SQL and Java code through the `INIT` parameter in the H2 connection string.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    - Improper Input Validation: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied connection string parameters, particularly the `INIT` parameter of the H2 JDBC connection string.\n    - Code Injection: The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary SQL and Java code through the `INIT=RUNSCRIPT FROM` command in the H2 connection string.\n    - Remote Command Execution: By crafting a malicious SQL script to create an alias for a Java function (e.g., `shellexec`), the attacker can then use that alias to execute operating system commands on the server.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can achieve remote command execution on the server where the vulnerable DataEase application is running, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.\n- **Attack vectors:**\n    - The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a crafted POST request to the `/de2api/datasource/validate` endpoint.\n    - This request includes a malicious H2 data source configuration containing the exploit.\n    - The vulnerable application then processes this request, using the malicious configuration to create a database connection which, in turn, executes the attacker's commands.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n    - The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable DataEase server.\n    - The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the `/de2api/datasource/validate` endpoint.\n    - The attacker doesn't need any special user privileges within the DataEase application.",

CWE-95 specifically addresses the case of dynamic code evaluation, making it a more precise fit than its parent. CWE-20 is a high level class that is a child of the Pillar CWE-310.

The vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary both support this, highlighting the lack of sanitization of the H2 database connection string, which allows execution of arbitrary SQL and Java code through the `INIT` parameter.\n\nThe selection of CWE-95 is based on the fact that the application **does not properly** sanitize user-supplied connection string parameters, particularly the `INIT` parameter of the H2 JDBC connection string, leading to code injection. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section explicitly states this **root cause of vulnerability**: \"The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the H2 database connection string within the DataEase application.\"\n\nCWE-20 is included as a secondary weakness because the **improper input validation** is a prerequisite for the code injection vulnerability. However, CWE-20 is a broad category, and CWE-95 provides a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nThe retriever results also support the selection of CWE-95, with a high relevance score.\nThe evidence provided is sufficient to justify the selection of CWE-95 as the primary weakness and CWE-20 as a secondary weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
