  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved clk bcm dvp Assign ->num before accessing ->hws Commit f316cdff8d67 (clk Annotate struct clk_hw_onecell_data with __counted_by) annotated the hws member of struct clk_hw_onecell_data with __counted_by, which informs the bounds sanitizer about the number of elements in hws, so that it can warn when hws is accessed out of bounds. As noted in that change, the __counted_by member must be initialized with the number of elements before the first array access happens, otherwise there will be a warning from each access prior to the initialization because the number of elements is zero. This occurs in clk_dvp_probe() due to ->num being assigned after ->hws has been accessed UBSAN array-index-out-of-bounds in drivers/clk/bcm/clk-bcm2711-dvp.c592 index 0 is out of range for type struct clk_hw *[] __counted_by(num) (aka struct clk_hw *[]) Move the ->num initialization to before the first access of ->hws, which clears up the warning.",
