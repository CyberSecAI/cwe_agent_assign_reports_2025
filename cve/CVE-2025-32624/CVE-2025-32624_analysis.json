It provides detailed information about the vulnerability.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). This allows a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - specifically in the \"Czater.pl \u2013 live chat i telefon\" plugin.\n*   Broken Access Control (OWASP Top 10 - A1)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nA malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nThe attack vector is Cross-Site Request Forgery, requiring no authentication.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Unauthenticated attacker.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Remove and replace the software:** The plugin is likely abandoned and won't receive updates.\n*   vPatch is unnecessary due to the low severity.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **Affected Software:** Czater.pl \u2013 live chat i telefon Plugin\n*   **Vulnerable Versions:** <= 1.0.5\n*   **Fixed Version:** N/A (no official fix available)\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.1 (Low Severity)\n*   **PSID:** 81ec39043905\n*   **Researcher:** Abdi Pranata\n*   **Publication Date:** 9 April 2025\n*   **Report Date:** 27 Jan 2025\n*   The software is considered likely abandoned, increasing the risk.\n*   Information about supporting the researcher who reported the vulnerability is provided.\n*   Timeline of the vulnerability disclosure is included.\n*   Links to Patchstack's services (vPatching, virtual patching) and resources are provided.",
