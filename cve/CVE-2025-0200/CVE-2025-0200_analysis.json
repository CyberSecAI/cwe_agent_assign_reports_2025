  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Vulnerability Details:**\n\n*   **Root Cause:** SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `search_num.php` file of the \"pos-inventory-system-in-php\" application. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `name` parameter before using it in an SQL query.\n\n*   **Weakness:** The application directly incorporates the `$search` parameter into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.\n\n*   **Impact:** A malicious attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code through the vulnerable parameter, potentially allowing them to:\n    *   Bypass authentication\n    *   Read, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database.\n    *  Potentially gain complete access to the database server.\n\n*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is exploited through an HTTP POST request to the `search_num.php` file. The attacker manipulates the `name` parameter to include malicious SQL code.\n\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.\n    *   No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.\n    *   The attacker needs to know the endpoint path.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\nThe provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the SQL injection:\n* The vulnerable parameter is `name`.\n* The PoC utilizes a payload `' or 1=1--` within the `name` parameter to create a SQL injection.\n* When the application uses the injected payload, the SQL query always evaluates to true and bypasses the intended search criteria.\n\n```\nPOST /POS_inventory/user/search_num.php HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost\nContent-Length: 12\nCache-Control: max-age=0\nsec-ch-ua: \"Chromium\";v=\"131\", \"Not_A Brand\";v=\"24\"\nsec-ch-ua-mobile: ?0\nsec-ch-ua-platform: \"Windows\"\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/131.0.6778.140 Safari/537.36\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7\nSec-Fetch-Site: same-origin\nSec-Fetch-Mode: navigate\nSec-Fetch-User: ?1\nSec-Fetch-Dest: document\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\nCookie: PHPSESSID=efr9d42glf5s6l2qp92e9rk9g1\nConnection: keep-alive\n\nname=1%' or 1=1-- -&num=1\n```\n\n**Additional Notes**\n\n*   The vulnerable application is identified as a \"pos-inventory-system-in-php\" and is available from [https://code-projects.org/pos-inventory-system-using-php-source-code/](https://code-projects.org/pos-inventory-system-using-php-source-code/)\n*   The file `search_num.php` in the `/user/` directory is the source of the vulnerability.\n*   The exploit is shown to work in an environment with a host of 'localhost'.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe provided content clearly describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the identified PHP application, and the PoC demonstrates the ease with which the vulnerability can be exploited.",

The key phrases clearly indicate an **SQL Injection** vulnerability. The provided content from the CVE reference links explicitly states that the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query, matching the definition of **CWE-89**.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-89** is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately represents the root cause of the vulnerability: the **improper neutralization** of special elements leading to **SQL Injection**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
