  "description": "A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager, formerly Cisco SD-WAN vManage, could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to inject HTML into the browser of an authenticated user. This vulnerability is due to **improper sanitization of input** to the web interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing an authenticated user to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject HTML into the browser of an authenticated Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager user.",

CWE-79 is a base-level CWE. CWE-116 and CWE-20 are higher-level classes which could be related to the **improper sanitization of input**, but they are not specific enough.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe116 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe116,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper sanitization of input** and leads to the ability to inject HTML into a user's browser, thus achieving cross-site scripting.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is heavily based on the provided evidence, particularly the \"**improper sanitization of input**\" root cause and the resulting \"inject HTML into the browser\" impact. The retriever results and relationship analysis support the selection of CWE-79 as the primary CWE. The evidence is strong, and the selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
