# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-13321

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-13321

## Description

The AnalyticsWP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the custom_sql parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.0 due to **insufficient authorization checks on the handle_get_stats() function**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** insufficient authorization checks on the handle_get_stats() function
- **Weakness:** SQL injection
- **Impact:** extract sensitive information from the database
- **Attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **Product:** AnalyticsWP plugin for WordPress
- **Version:** up to and including 2.0.0
- **Component:** custom_sql parameter

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis

The primary relationship is that CWE-89 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')] is a consequence of CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]. If there was proper authorization, the unauthenticated attacker would not be able to inject SQL commands.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient authorization checks** (CWE-862), which allows an unauthenticated attacker to inject SQL commands (CWE-89), leading to the ability to **extract sensitive information from the database**.

## Summary of Analysis

The vulnerability is an SQL injection vulnerability (CWE-89) that is made possible due to a **lack of authorization checks** (CWE-862) on the `handle_get_stats()` function. The evidence for this assessment is strong, as the description explicitly states both the **root cause** (**insufficient authorization checks**) and the **weakness** (**SQL injection**). The graph relationships show how these CWEs can be related, with improper or missing authorization often leading to vulnerabilities like SQL injection. CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it clearly describes the type of injection vulnerability.

The selection of CWE-89 is strongly supported by the retriever results, which give it a score of 1.0. The guidance also supports this selection, as it indicates that if the root cause is a missing authorization check, then CWE-862 is the appropriate CWE.

The vulnerability description key phrases indicates:
- **rootcause:** **insufficient authorization checks on the handle_get_stats() function**
- **weakness:** **SQL injection**

CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] is the root cause.
CWE-89 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')] is the weakness.

Other CWEs Considered:

*   CWE-284 [Improper Access Control]: This is a more general CWE and less specific than CWE-862, which directly addresses the **missing authorization**. Therefore, CWE-284 is not the most appropriate choice.
*   CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization]: This CWE applies when there is an authorization check, but it is implemented incorrectly. In this case, the description indicates that authorization checks are **insufficient**, implying that they are missing, making CWE-862 a better fit.
*   CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function]: While related to access control, this is about missing authentication, not authorization. Since the vulnerability description does not suggest any problems with authentication, this CWE is not applicable.
*   CWE-74 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')]: CWE-74 is a Class-level CWE. CWE-89 is a child of CWE-74 and more descriptive, so is a better fit.
