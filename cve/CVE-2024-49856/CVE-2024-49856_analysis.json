  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved x86/sgx Fix **deadlock in SGX NUMA node search** When the current node doesnt have an EPC section configured by firmware and all other EPC sections are used up, CPU can get stuck inside the while loop that looks for an available EPC page from remote nodes indefinitely, leading to a soft lockup. Note how nid_of_current will never be equal to nid in that while loop because nid_of_current is not set in sgx_numa_mask. Also worth mentioning is that its perfectly fine for the firmware not to setup an EPC section on a node. While setting up an EPC section on each node can enhance performance, it is not a requirement for functionality. Rework the loop to start and end on *a* node that has SGX memory. This avoids the deadlock looking for the current SGX-lacking node to show up in the loop when it never will.",

  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the NUMA node search logic within the `__sgx_alloc_epc_page` function. When the current node lacks an EPC section, and all other EPC sections are exhausted, the function could get stuck in an infinite loop while searching for an available EPC page from remote nodes, causing a soft lockup. The `nid_of_current` was not part of the `sgx_numa_mask`, causing the loop to never terminate if the node didn't have SGX support.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The main vulnerability is a deadlock scenario within the allocation logic due to a flawed loop condition when searching for an EPC page across NUMA nodes.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a soft lockup, effectively rendering the affected CPU core unresponsive.\n- **Attack vectors:** This isn't an externally triggered vulnerability. The deadlock can be triggered internally in the allocation process if an SGX application requests EPC memory and the system's NUMA configuration leads to the described deadlock conditions.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not directly exploit the vulnerability. It is triggered by the normal SGX memory allocation mechanism under specific circumstances involving node configuration and resource usage.",

CWE-835 (Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition) is considered as a potential contributing factor or a more specific manifestation of the deadlock, as the deadlock arises from an infinite loop. Both are Base level CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe833[\"CWE-833: Deadlock\"]\n    cwe835[\"CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')\"]\n    \n    cwe835 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe833\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe833 primary\n    class cwe835 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with a **deadlock in SGX NUMA node search** (CWE-833). This deadlock is caused by a loop that fails to terminate (**Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')** CWE-835) when searching for an available EPC page from remote nodes. The impact of this deadlock is a soft lockup, rendering the affected CPU core unresponsive.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is clearly a deadlock, as explicitly stated in the vulnerability description: \"**deadlock in SGX NUMA node search**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further corroborates this, stating that the \"main vulnerability is a deadlock scenario within the allocation logic\". This aligns directly with CWE-833 (Deadlock).\n\nCWE-835 (Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')) is a strong secondary candidate. The vulnerability description explains that the CPU can get stuck inside the `while` loop. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also mentions the function could get stuck in an infinite loop. While the deadlock is the primary issue, the infinite loop is the underlying cause contributing to the deadlock.\n\nI considered other CWEs, but they didn't fit as well:\n\n*   CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption): While a deadlock does consume resources indefinitely, the primary issue isn't about resource management but rather the inability of threads to proceed.\n*   CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value): This isn't about allocating excessive memory, so it is not applicable.\n*   CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) and CWE-606 (Unchecked Input for Loop Condition): These CWEs relate to improper input validation which is not mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-833 and CWE-835 provides the most accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability, addressing both the core problem (deadlock) and the immediate cause (infinite loop).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-833: Deadlock\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
