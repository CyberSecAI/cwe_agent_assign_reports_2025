# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-6166

## Description

The Unlimited Elements For Elementor (Free Widgets, Addons, Templates) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **time-based SQL Injection** via the addons_order parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.112 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above and granted plugin setting edit permissions by an administrator, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query
- **Weakness:** time-based SQL Injection
- **Impact:** extract sensitive information from the database
- **Attacker:** authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access and above
- **Product:** ['Unlimited Elements For Elementor (Free Widgets', 'Addons', 'Templates) plugin for WordPress']
- **Version:** up to and including 1.5.112
- **Component:** addons_order parameter

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 1 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the CWE selection was the ChildOf relationship between CWE-89 and CWE-74. While CWE-74 is a broader class of injection vulnerabilities, the specific vulnerability description clearly indicates SQL injection, making CWE-89 the more appropriate and specific choice.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient preparation** of the SQL query, leading to the **time-based SQL Injection** vulnerability. The ultimate impact is the ability to extract sensitive information from the database.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided evidence, which includes the vulnerability description, key phrases, and CVE reference links content summary. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **"time-based SQL Injection"** and attributes it to **"insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query"**. The CVE reference links content summary further confirms that the root cause is **insufficient input sanitization/escaping** and **lack of prepared statements**, resulting in a time-based SQL injection vulnerability that allows for sensitive data extraction. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the most relevant CWE.

The selected CWE, CWE-89, is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the identified SQL injection vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: alternate_terms

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

# Complete CWE Specifications

CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: base

**Description**:
CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Relationships**:
- PARENTOF -> CWE-564
- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-456
- CHILDOF -> CWE-74
- CHILDOF -> CWE-943
- PARENTOF -> CWE-89

The vulnerability description clearly points to an SQL Injection vulnerability due to **insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient preparation** on the SQL query. Therefore, CWE-89 is the most appropriate choice.

CWEs Considered but Not Used:

*   CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection') - While this is a parent of CWE-89, it is too general for this specific case of SQL Injection.
*   CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output - This is related to the **insufficient escaping**, but CWE-89 more accurately captures the vulnerability.
*   CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization and CWE-862: Missing Authorization - These CWEs are related to authorization issues, but the vulnerability is primarily due to SQL injection.
*   CWE-91: XML Injection (aka Blind XPath Injection) - This is specific to XML injection, which is not the case here.
