  "description": "51l3nc3, member of the AXIS OS Bug Bounty Program, has found that the VAPIX API managedoverlayimages.cgi was vulnerable to a **race condition** attack allowing for an attacker to block access to the overlay configuration page in the web interface of the Axis device. This flaw can only be exploited after authenticating with an operator- or administrator-privileged service account. Axis has released patched AXIS OS versions for the highlighted flaw. Please refer to the Axis security advisory for more information and solution.",

CWE-362 is a Class-level CWE representing the general concept of a race condition, while CWE-367 is a Base-level CWE focusing on the specific case of a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. The description indicates a general **race condition**, making CWE-362 a more appropriate fit, even though CWE-367 was also considered.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n\n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe367 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **race condition** (CWE-362), which allows an attacker to block access to the overlay configuration page. The root cause is the improper synchronization when accessing a shared resource, leading to the impact of blocked access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The description explicitly mentions a **race condition** in the `managedoverlayimages.cgi` endpoint. The retriever results highlighted CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) and CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition) as potential candidates. After careful consideration, CWE-362 was chosen as the primary CWE because it represents the general class of **race condition**, while CWE-367 is a more specific type. The evidence supports the presence of a **race condition** that leads to blocking access to the overlay configuration page. The selection of CWE-362 is at an appropriate level of specificity, as it captures the essence of the vulnerability without over-specifying the exact type of race condition. The evidence for the **race condition** is directly from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\".\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
