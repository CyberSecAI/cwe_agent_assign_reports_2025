  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the SQL Injection vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- The application constructs a SQL query by directly concatenating user-supplied input (specifically the `id` parameter) into the query string within the `$http.get` call.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **SQL Injection:** The `id` parameter in the `GetById` API endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injection because it is not properly sanitized or parameterized before being used in the SQL query.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database. This can lead to data exfiltration, modification, deletion, or even denial of service.\n- As demonstrated by the provided payload (`%20waitfor%20delay'0%3a0%3a10'--`), an attacker can introduce delays using the `waitfor delay` command, which indicates the ability to run SQL commands.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n-  The vulnerability is triggered via a GET request to the `/uiomatic/object/GetById` endpoint. Specifically, the vulnerable parameter is `id`.\n   -  The full path of the vulnerable code is: `UIOMatic/src/UIOMatic/wwwroot/backoffice/resources/uioMaticObject.resource.js` at line 104.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to have access to the backoffice of the application to exploit the vulnerability.\n- The attacker would need to intercept the request, modify the `id` parameter with the SQL payload and then send the request.",
