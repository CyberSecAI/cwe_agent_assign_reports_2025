# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-5946

## Vulnerability Description
The Squelch Tabs and Accordions Shortcodes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the tab shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 0.4.8 due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
### CVE-2024-5946 Analysis:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Squelch Tabs and Accordions Shortcodes plugin for WordPress, in versions up to 0.4.8, is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the ‘tab’ shortcode.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input when processing the 'tab' shortcode. This allows malicious scripts to be stored in the database and executed when a page containing the shortcode is rendered.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not adequately sanitize the attributes of the `tab` shortcode, specifically the `title`, `icon`, and `class` attributes.
- **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly escape the output of the shortcode's attributes, allowing the injected scripts to be executed by the browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to:
- **Inject arbitrary web scripts:** This can lead to various malicious actions, including redirecting users to phishing sites, stealing session cookies, defacing websites, or performing other unwanted actions within the context of the user's browser.
- **Compromise user accounts:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker can steal user credentials or perform actions on behalf of the logged-in user.
- **Take over websites:** Depending on the severity and scope of the injected script, the attacker can potentially take control of the entire website.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Shortcode Injection:** The vulnerability is triggered by inserting a specially crafted `tab` shortcode into a WordPress post or page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with "Contributor" level access or higher to create/edit posts/pages and inject the malicious shortcode.
