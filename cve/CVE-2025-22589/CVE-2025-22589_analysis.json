The specific impact varies case by case.\n\nAttack vectors:\nNot specified beyond the general nature of CSRF.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\nUnauthenticated.\n\nMitigation or fix:\nNo official fix available. Patchstack vPatching can auto-mitigate the vulnerability.\n\nAdditional details:\n- Vulnerable versions: <= 0.7\n- CVSS score: 7.1 (Low severity)\n- OWASP Top 10: A1: Broken Access Control\n- Reported by: SOPROBRO\n- PSID: 9476abd12299",
