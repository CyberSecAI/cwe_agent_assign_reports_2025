## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the selection was the direct match of **storing secrets in run config files** with the description of CWE-532, which involves writing sensitive information to a log file. CWE-212 and CWE-257 were considered as related weaknesses due to the nature of the stored data and the potential for exposure.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **storing secrets in run config files** (CWE-532), potentially due to **improper removal of sensitive information** (CWE-212), which leads to **storing passwords/secrets in a recoverable format** (CWE-257) since the stored configs are not encrypted. The impact is that an attacker with access to the home folder can read secrets without needing access to the secrets store itself.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is the **insertion of secrets into run config files**, which directly aligns with CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File). The retriever results also listed CWE-532 as the top result. The description explicitly states that the ToolHive application inadvertently **stores secrets in the run config files**. This maps directly to the description of CWE-532, where a product writes sensitive information to a log file, or in this case, a configuration file used similarly to a log. This file resides in the user's home directory, making it accessible to local attackers. The vulnerability exists because the ToolHive application does not properly manage the storage of secrets, leading to their unintended exposure.

CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer) is a secondary consideration. It's possible that the root cause involves a failure to sanitize or remove sensitive data before writing it to the configuration file. The vulnerability description mentions "inadvertently store secrets," suggesting a lack of proper handling.

CWE-257 (Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format) is also a secondary consideration because, even though the information is not necessarily a password, it is a secret stored in a recoverable format.

The retriever results and graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the direct correspondence between the vulnerability description and CWE-532.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-277: Insecure Inherited Permissions
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product defines a set of insecure permissions that are inherited by objects that are created by the program.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
