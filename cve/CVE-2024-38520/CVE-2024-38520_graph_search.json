When SoftEtherVPN is deployed with L2TP enabled on a device, it introduces the possibility of the host being used for amplification/reflection traffic generation because it will respond to every packet with two response packets that are larger than the request packet size. These sorts of techniques are used by external actors who generate spoofed source IPs to target a destination on the internet. This vulnerability has been patched in version 5.02.5185. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-121 CWE-1284 CWE-444 CWE-346 CWE-406 CWE-319 CWE-770 CWE-301 CWE-408 CWE-941",
