## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Deserialization of Untrusted Data in multiple OpenCart modules named `aridius_XYZ`. The vulnerability is a result of the `unserialize` function being used on data from an unauthenticated POST request, allowing for PHP Object Injection.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
  - CAPEC-586: Object Injection
- Impact of exploitation:
  - An attacker could potentially compromise a site. The example provided shows how an attacker could write arbitrary files or achieve Remote Code Execution.
- Attack vectors: Unauthenticated POST request.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable `loadMore` endpoint of the affected modules.
- Mitigation or fix:
  - Search for the presence of the `unserialize` function.
  - Include the `allowed_classes` option to disable Object Injection: `$setting = unserialize(base64_decode($this->request->post['setting']), ['allowed_classes' => FALSE]);`
  - Replace the use of serialization with `json_encode` and `json_decode`.
