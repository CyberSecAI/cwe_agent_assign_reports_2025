It provides significantly more detail than the placeholder CVE description. Here\\'s an extraction of the relevant information:\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\n\\nThe plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n\\n*   Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n\\nAllows high privilege users (e.g., admin) to perform Stored XSS attacks even when `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed (e.g., in multisite setup).\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n\\n1.  Access the \"All Pages view\".\\n2.  Create a page.\\n3.  Select \"Add Child Page\".\\n4.  Insert a malicious payload (e.g., `\"&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(333)&gt;\"`) in the Title field.\\n5.  Save and reload the page.\\n6.  Select \"Add Child Page\" on the last added page to trigger the XSS.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n\\nEditor+ privilege level.\\n\\n**Mitigation or fix:**\\n\\nUpdate to version 3.2.9 or later.\\n\\n**Additional Details:**\\n\\n*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8759\\n*   **CVSS Score:** 3.5 (Low)\\n*   **Affected Plugin:** Nested Pages <= 3.2.8\\n*   **Fixed in:** 3.2.9\\n*   **Researcher:** Krugov Artyom\\n*   **References:**\\n    *   [https://research.cleantalk.org/CVE-2024-8759/](https://research.cleantalk.org/CVE-2024-8759/)\\n*   **OWASP Top 10:** A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\\n*   **CWE:** CWE-79', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:does not sanitise and escape some of its settings', 'keyphrase': 'does not sanitise and escape some of its settings', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'rootcause:unfiltered_html capability disallowed', 'keyphrase': 'unfiltered_html capability disallowed', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks', 'keyphrase': 'Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'attacker:high privilege users', 'keyphrase': 'high privilege users', 'type': 'attacker'}, {'id': 'product:Nested Pages WordPress plugin', 'keyphrase': 'Nested Pages WordPress plugin', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:before 3.2.9', 'keyphrase': 'before 3.2.9', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(576.2573887216088)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
