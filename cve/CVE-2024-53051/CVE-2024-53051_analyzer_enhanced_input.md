## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/i915/hdcp Add encoder check in intel_hdcp_get_capability Sometimes during hotplug scenario or suspend/resume scenario encoder is not always initialized when intel_hdcp_get_capability add a check to avoid kernel null pointer dereference.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **encoder not initialized**
- **impact:** kernel null pointer dereference
- **vector:** hotplug scenario or suspend/resume scenario
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** drm/i915/hdcp

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to a fix for a potential null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel's i915 graphics driver, specifically within the HDCP (High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection) functionality. This fix is relevant to the issue described in the CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of a check for encoder initialization within the `intel_hdcp_get_capability` function. During hotplug or suspend/resume scenarios, the encoder might not always be initialized, leading to a null pointer dereference when `intel_attached_dig_port` is called. This function assumes a valid, initialized encoder.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference vulnerability.
- Missing check for encoder initialization before accessing associated data structures.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash due to null pointer dereference.
- System instability due to the kernel panic.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering hotplug events when the display encoder is not fully initialized.
- Triggering suspend/resume cycles where the encoder is not initialized during the HDCP capability check.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to trigger hotplug events or suspend/resume cycles on a system with the vulnerable i915 driver.
- No special privileges are explicitly required, meaning the vulnerability could be triggered by standard user activity.
