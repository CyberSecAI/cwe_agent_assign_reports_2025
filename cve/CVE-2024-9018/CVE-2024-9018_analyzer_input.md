# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-9018

## Vulnerability Description
The WP Easy Gallery - WordPress Gallery Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **time-based SQL Injection** via the key parameter in all versions up to, and including, 4.8.5 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**
- **weakness:** **time-based SQL Injection**
- **impact:** extract sensitive information from the database
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers
- **product:** WP Easy Gallery - WordPress Gallery Plugin
- **version:** up to and including 4.8.5
- **component:** key parameter

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the `key` parameter within the WP Easy Gallery plugin. This lack of proper escaping and preparation allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code into existing queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is the injection of malicious SQL code due to inadequate input validation.
- **Insufficient escaping:** User-supplied parameters like `key` are not properly escaped before being used in SQL queries.
- **Lack of sufficient preparation:** The existing SQL queries lack sufficient preparation to prevent the injection of additional SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to extract sensitive information from the WordPress database. This could include user credentials, configuration settings, and other confidential data.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, attackers could potentially gain higher privileges by manipulating database records.
- **Full system compromise:** It may be possible to achieve remote code execution by exploiting the database with crafted queries.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack is carried out over the network via HTTP requests.
- **`key` parameter:** The `key` parameter of the plugin is the entry point for the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** Attackers need to be authenticated users on the WordPress site.
- **Contributor Role or Higher:** The vulnerability is exploitable by users with a Contributor role or higher. This indicates that the vulnerability can be exploited by a wide range of users on the site.

**Additional Notes:**
- **Time-Based SQL Injection:**  The vulnerability is a time-based SQL injection, which can be more difficult to detect because it involves observing time delays caused by database operations within the crafted SQL.
- **Unpatched:** As of the time of the report, no patch is available. It is recommended to uninstall the plugin until a fix is available.
- **Plugin Closed:** The plugin has been closed on the WordPress plugin repository due to the security issue.
