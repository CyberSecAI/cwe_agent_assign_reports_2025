  "description": "The WP Easy Gallery - WordPress Gallery Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **time-based SQL Injection** via the key parameter in all versions up to, and including, 4.8.5 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the `key` parameter within the WP Easy Gallery plugin. This lack of proper escaping and preparation allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code into existing queries.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is the injection of malicious SQL code due to inadequate input validation.\n- **Insufficient escaping:** User-supplied parameters like `key` are not properly escaped before being used in SQL queries.\n- **Lack of sufficient preparation:** The existing SQL queries lack sufficient preparation to prevent the injection of additional SQL code.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to extract sensitive information from the WordPress database. This could include user credentials, configuration settings, and other confidential data.\n- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data within the database.\n- **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, attackers could potentially gain higher privileges by manipulating database records.\n- **Full system compromise:** It may be possible to achieve remote code execution by exploiting the database with crafted queries.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network-based:** The attack is carried out over the network via HTTP requests.\n- **`key` parameter:** The `key` parameter of the plugin is the entry point for the attack.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Authentication:** Attackers need to be authenticated users on the WordPress site.\n- **Contributor Role or Higher:** The vulnerability is exploitable by users with a Contributor role or higher. This indicates that the vulnerability can be exploited by a wide range of users on the site.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- **Time-Based SQL Injection:**  The vulnerability is a time-based SQL injection, which can be more difficult to detect because it involves observing time delays caused by database operations within the crafted SQL.\n- **Unpatched:** As of the time of the report, no patch is available. It is recommended to uninstall the plugin until a fix is available.\n- **Plugin Closed:** The plugin has been closed on the WordPress plugin repository due to the security issue.",

The **root cause** is **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query** which leads to **SQL Injection**. CWE-116 is a related Class-level CWE that covers improper encoding or escaping in general, making it a potential secondary factor. CWE-89 is a child of CWE-943 (Improper Neutralization Across a Trust Boundary) and CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component), but it's more specific and directly applicable to the **SQL Injection** vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component\"]\n    cwe943[\"CWE-943: Improper Neutralization Across a Trust Boundary\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe943\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe116 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient escaping** of the `key` parameter and **lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This leads directly to **SQL Injection** (CWE-89). The impact of this vulnerability is the potential to extract sensitive information from the database.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which indicates that the WP Easy Gallery plugin is vulnerable to **time-based SQL Injection** due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This aligns perfectly with CWE-89, which describes the **improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command**.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states that the plugin is vulnerable to **time-based SQL injection** due to **insufficient escaping** of the user-supplied parameter and a **lack of sufficient preparation** of the existing SQL query. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code into existing queries, potentially extracting sensitive information from the database.\n\nCWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the SQL Injection vulnerability.
