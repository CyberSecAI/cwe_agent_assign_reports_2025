  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved fs/jfs Prevent integer overflow in AG size calculation The JFS filesystem calculates allocation group (AG) size using 1 2TB aggregates on 32-bit systems), this 32-bit shift operation causes **undefined behavior and improper AG sizing**. On 32-bit architectures - Left-shifting 1 by 32+ bits results in 0 due to integer overflow - This creates invalid AG sizes (0 or garbage values) in sbi->bmap->db_agsize - Subsequent block allocations would reference invalid AG structures - Could lead to - Filesystem corruption during extend operations - Kernel crashes due to invalid memory accesses - Security vulnerabilities via malformed on-disk structures Fix by casting to s64 before shifting bmp->db_agsize = (s64)1 << l2agsize This ensures 64-bit arithmetic even on 32-bit architectures. The cast matches the data type of db_agsize (s64) and follows similar patterns in JFS block calculation code. Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",

It is related to other CWEs such as CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size) and CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), which can be potential consequences of an integer overflow. These relationships help to understand the potential impact of the vulnerability. The choice of CWE-190 is based on the **root cause** being the integer overflow during the allocation group (AG) size calculation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe131[\"CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    \n    cwe131 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe125\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe131\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe131,cwe125 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper calculation of the allocation group size due to integer overflow** (CWE-190). This leads to invalid AG sizes, which in turn can cause subsequent block allocations to reference invalid AG structures, potentially resulting in filesystem corruption, kernel crashes due to invalid memory accesses, or security vulnerabilities. Incorrect calculation of buffer size (CWE-131) might occur due to this, which can lead to an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the vulnerability description, which clearly states that the **root cause** is an integer overflow during the calculation of the allocation group size.\n\n\"JFS filesystem calculates allocation group (AG) size using 1 2TB aggregates on 32-bit systems), this 32-bit shift operation causes **undefined behavior and improper AG sizing**.
