  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-47883', description='The OpenRefine fork of the MIT Simile Butterfly server is a modular web application framework. The Butterfly framework uses the `java.net.URL` class to refer to (what are expected to be) local resource files, like images or templates. This works opening a connection to these URLs opens the local file. However, prior to version 1.2.6, if a `file/` URL is directly given where a relative path (resource name) is expected, this is also accepted in some code paths the app then fetches the file, from a remote machine if indicated, and uses it as if it was a trusted part of the apps codebase. This leads to multiple weaknesses and potential weaknesses. An attacker that has network access to the application could use it to gain access to files, either on the the servers filesystem (path traversal) or shared by nearby machines (**server-side request forgery** with e.g. SMB). An attacker that can lead or redirect a user to a crafted URL belonging to the app could cause arbitrary attacker-controlled JavaScript to be loaded in the victims browser (**cross-site scripting**). If an app is written in such a way that an attacker can influence the resource name used for a template, that attacker could cause the app to fetch and execute an attacker-controlled template (**remote code execution**). Version 1.2.6 contains a patch.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'improper input validation', 'weakness': ['server-side request forgery', 'cross-site scripting', 'remote code execution'], 'impact': 'access files', 'vector': 'crafted URL', 'attacker': 'attacker with network access', 'product': 'OpenRefine fork of the MIT Simile Butterfly server', 'version': 'prior to version 1.2.6', 'component': ''}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:\\n\\n**Root Cause:**\\n\\nThe vulnerability stems from the Butterfly framework's use of `java.net.URL` to handle local resource files. The `getResource` method in `ButterflyModuleImpl` directly uses the provided resource string to create a URL, without proper validation, if the string starts with `file:/`. This allows the application to access arbitrary resources including those outside of the intended application directory, or even on other machines accessible via the network.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n\\n*   **Path Traversal:** An attacker can provide a `file:/` URL with path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files outside the application's intended directory on the server's filesystem.\\n*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** By providing a `file:/` URL pointing to a resource on a remote machine (e.g., a shared SMB resource), an attacker can force the application to fetch and serve that resource.\\n*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If an attacker can craft a URL that points to a malicious JavaScript file, and can redirect a user to that URL through the application, the JavaScript will be executed in the user's browser.\\n*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If an attacker can control the resource name used for a template (e.g., Velocity template), they can force the application to fetch and execute an attacker-controlled template, potentially leading to RCE.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n\\n*   An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server's filesystem.\\n*   An attacker can access resources on other machines via SSRF, potentially gaining further access to systems.\\n*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.\\n*   An attacker can achieve RCE by forcing the application to process malicious templates.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n\\n*   **Network Access:** An attacker with network access to the application can exploit the SSRF vulnerability by providing crafted `file:/` URLs.\\n*   **Crafted URLs:** An attacker can craft URLs and redirect users to these URLs to trigger XSS vulnerabilities or force the application to fetch malicious resources.\\n*   **Template Manipulation:** If an attacker can control or influence the resource name used for templates, they can exploit the RCE vulnerability.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n\\n*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application to exploit the SSRF vulnerability.\\n*   **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to craft specific URLs that will exploit the path traversal, XSS, or RCE vulnerabilities.\\n*  **Influence over template resource names:** In order to perform RCE, the attacker needs to be able to influence the resource name used for templates.\\n\\n**Additional Details:**\\n\\n*   The vulnerability is in the `ButterflyModuleImpl.getResource` method, which does not validate `file:/` URLs or ensure that the resources fetched are within the expected directory.\\n*   The Velocity template library, which relies on the same `getResource` implementation, is also vulnerable if template resource names can be manipulated.\\n*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) is provided demonstrating the vulnerability with OpenRefine, where an attacker could retrieve and execute arbitrary files or JavaScript from an SMB share.\\n\\nThe fix for this issue is described in the commit message, and involves ensuring that resources fetched are within the expected directory and disabling the fetching of remote resources.\\n\\n**CVE Information:**\\nThe provided text references `CVE-2024-47883` and `GHSA-3p8v-w8mr-m3x8` which is the corresponding GitHub Security Advisory.

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    The OpenRefine fork of the MIT Simile Butterfly server is a modular web application framework. The Butterfly framework uses the `java.net.URL` class to refer to (what are expected to be) local resource files, like images or templates. This works opening a connection to these URLs opens the local file. However, prior to version 1.2.6, if a `file/` URL is directly given where a relative path (resource name) is expected, this is also accepted in some code paths the app then fetches the file, from a remote machine if indicated, and uses it as if it was a trusted part of the apps codebase. This leads to multiple weaknesses and potential weaknesses. An attacker that has network access to the application could use it to gain access to files, either on the the servers filesystem (path traversal) or shared by nearby machines (**server-side request forgery** with e.g. SMB). An attacker that can lead or redirect a user to a crafted URL belonging to the app could cause arbitrary attacker-controlled JavaScript to be loaded in the victims browser (**cross-site scripting**). If an app is written in such a way that an attacker can influence the resource name used for a template, that attacker could cause the app to fetch and execute an attacker-controlled template (**remote code execution**). Version 1.2.6 contains a patch.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'improper input validation'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
