  "description": "The OpenRefine fork of the MIT Simile Butterfly server is a modular web application framework. The Butterfly framework uses the `java.net.URL` class to refer to (what are expected to be) local resource files, like images or templates. This works opening a connection to these URLs opens the local file. However, prior to version 1.2.6, if a `file/` URL is directly given where a relative path (resource name) is expected, this is also accepted in some code paths the app then fetches the file, from a remote machine if indicated, and uses it as if it was a trusted part of the apps codebase. This leads to multiple weaknesses and potential weaknesses. An attacker that has network access to the application could use it to gain access to files, either on the the servers filesystem (path traversal) or shared by nearby machines (**server-side request forgery** with e.g. SMB). An attacker that can lead or redirect a user to a crafted URL belonging to the app could cause arbitrary attacker-controlled JavaScript to be loaded in the victims browser (**cross-site scripting**). If an app is written in such a way that an attacker can influence the resource name used for a template, that attacker could cause the app to fetch and execute an attacker-controlled template (**remote code execution**). Version 1.2.6 contains a patch.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the Butterfly framework's use of `java.net.URL` to handle local resource files. The `getResource` method in `ButterflyModuleImpl` directly uses the provided resource string to create a URL, without proper validation, if the string starts with `file:/`. This allows the application to access arbitrary resources including those outside of the intended application directory, or even on other machines accessible via the network.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Path Traversal:** An attacker can provide a `file:/` URL with path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files outside the application's intended directory on the server's filesystem.\n*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** By providing a `file:/` URL pointing to a resource on a remote machine (e.g., a shared SMB resource), an attacker can force the application to fetch and serve that resource.\n*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If an attacker can craft a URL that points to a malicious JavaScript file, and can redirect a user to that URL through the application, the JavaScript will be executed in the user's browser.\n*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If an attacker can control the resource name used for a template (e.g., Velocity template), they can force the application to fetch and execute an attacker-controlled template, potentially leading to RCE.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server's filesystem.\n*   An attacker can access resources on other machines via SSRF, potentially gaining further access to systems.\n*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.\n*   An attacker can achieve RCE by forcing the application to process malicious templates.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** An attacker with network access to the application can exploit the SSRF vulnerability by providing crafted `file:/` URLs.\n*   **Crafted URLs:** An attacker can craft URLs and redirect users to these URLs to trigger XSS vulnerabilities or force the application to fetch malicious resources.\n*   **Template Manipulation:** If an attacker can control or influence the resource name used for templates, they can exploit the RCE vulnerability.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application to exploit the SSRF vulnerability.\n*   **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to craft specific URLs that will exploit the path traversal, XSS, or RCE vulnerabilities.\n*  **Influence over template resource names:** In order to perform RCE, the attacker needs to be able to influence the resource name used for templates.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is in the `ButterflyModuleImpl.getResource` method, which does not validate `file:/` URLs or ensure that the resources fetched are within the expected directory.\n*   The Velocity template library, which relies on the same `getResource` implementation, is also vulnerable if template resource names can be manipulated.\n*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) is provided demonstrating the vulnerability with OpenRefine, where an attacker could retrieve and execute arbitrary files or JavaScript from an SMB share.\n\nThe fix for this issue is described in the commit message, and involves ensuring that resources fetched are within the expected directory and disabling the fetching of remote resources.\n\n**CVE Information:**\nThe provided text references `CVE-2024-47883` and `GHSA-3p8v-w8mr-m3x8` which is the corresponding GitHub Security Advisory. This confirms the content is related to the specified CVE.",

The description also mentions the possibility of server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and remote code execution, which are related to **CWE-918**, **CWE-79**, and **CWE-1336**, respectively.\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that **CWE-22** is the primary weakness, as it is the root cause of the other vulnerabilities. The other CWEs are secondary weaknesses that result from the **improper limitation of a pathname**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they accurately represent the weaknesses described in the vulnerability description.\n\nThe other CWEs from **Complete CWE Specifications** were considered but not used because they were not as directly related to the vulnerability description. For example, **CWE-502** Deserialization of Untrusted Data was considered, but it was not selected because the vulnerability description does not mention deserialization.\n\n**CWE-41** Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence was not selected because the vulnerability is not related to path equivalence.\n\n**CWE-74** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection') was not selected because it is high-level and **CWE-22** is more appropriate.\n\n**CWE-184** Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs was not selected because the vulnerability is not related to an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.\n\n**CWE-138** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements was not selected because it is a Class and **CWE-22** is more appropriate.\n\n**CWE-80** Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS) was not selected because the description refers to arbitrary javascript injection, meaning it's not basic XSS.\n\n**CWE-23** Relative Path Traversal was not selected because **CWE-22** is more general and includes relative path traversal.\n\n**CWE-451** User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information was not selected because the vulnerability is not related to UI misrepresentation.\n\n**CWE-113** Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting') was not selected because the vulnerability is not related to CRLF sequences in HTTP headers.\n\n**CWE-668** Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere was not selected because it is high-level and **CWE-22** is more appropriate.\n\n**CWE-472** External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter was not selected because the vulnerability is not related to external control of assumed-immutable web parameters.\n\n**CWE-28** Path Traversal: '..\\filedir' was not selected because **CWE-22** is more general and includes this specific type of path traversal.\n\n**CWE-24** Path Traversal: '../filedir' was not selected because **CWE-22** is more general and includes this specific type of path traversal.\n\n**CWE-29** Path Traversal: '\\..\\filename' was not selected because **CWE-22** is more general and includes this specific type of path traversal.\n\n**CWE-78** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') was not selected because the vulnerability is not directly related to OS command injection.\n\n**CWE-98** Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion') was not selected because the vulnerability is not specific to PHP.\n\n**CWE-94** Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') was not selected because **CWE-1336** is more appropriate.\n\n**CWE-427** Uncontrolled Search Path Element was not selected because it is less directly related to the vulnerability than other candidates, although a case could be made for its inclusion.",
