  "description": "A vulnerability in the REST API and web UI of Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC) could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker to perform a **command injection** attack against an affected device. &nbsp This vulnerability is due to **improper user authorization and insufficient validation of command arguments**. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted commands to an affected REST API endpoint or through the web UI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the CLI of a Cisco NDFC-managed device with network-admin privileges. &nbsp Note This vulnerability does not affect Cisco NDFC when it is configured for storage area network (SAN) controller deployment.",

This is supported by the vulnerability description stating \"An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted commands to an affected REST API endpoint or through the web UI.\" The root cause is **improper user authorization** and **insufficient validation of command arguments**, indicating secondary weaknesses such as **CWE-863** (Incorrect Authorization) and **CWE-20** (Improper Input Validation).\n\n**Evidence:**\n\n*   Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:\n    *   **rootcause:** **improper user authorization and insufficient validation of command arguments**\n    *   **weakness:** **command injection**\n*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary:\n    *   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper user authorization and insufficient validation of command arguments.\n    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability in the REST API and web UI of Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC).\n\nThe Retriever Results also support the selection of **CWE-78** as it is listed as a Base level CWE and is related to command injection.\n\nOther CWEs considered:\n\n*   **CWE-77** (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')): This is a Class-level CWE and a parent of **CWE-78**.

Since the root cause includes both authorization and input validation issues, **CWE-863** and **CWE-20** are more appropriate.\n*   **CWE-306** (Missing Authentication for Critical Function): While the description mentions an authenticated attacker, the primary issue is not a complete lack of authentication, but rather **improper authorization**, making **CWE-863** a better fit.\n\nThe final selection of **CWE-78**, **CWE-863**, and **CWE-20** provides a comprehensive view of the vulnerability, covering both the specific weakness (command injection) and the underlying root causes (authorization and input validation).
