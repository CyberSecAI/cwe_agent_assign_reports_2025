This aligns with the vulnerability description, where the `ScheduledStatusReporter` blocks the main thread. A related CWE is CWE-400, which represents uncontrolled resource consumption, as the blocked thread makes the server unable to respond to other requests, leading to a denial of service. CWE-1322 is a child of CWE-834 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere), while CWE-400 is a class-level CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1322[\"CWE-1322: Use of Blocking Code in Single-threaded, Non-blocking Context\"]\n    cwe834[\"CWE-834: Excessive Iteration\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe1322 -->|CHILDOF| cwe834\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1322 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause**: the `ScheduledStatusReporter` running on the main thread (CWE-1322). This leads to the main thread being blocked indefinitely. The impact of the blocked thread causes the server to become unresponsive, ultimately resulting in a denial of service (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which states that the `ScheduledStatusReporter` object, when instantiated, runs on the main thread, leading to the main thread being blocked indefinitely, causing a denial of service.\n\nThe primary CWE, CWE-1322, is selected because the **root cause** is the use of blocking code (`ScheduledStatusReporter`) in a single-threaded, non-blocking context (the main thread of the tracking server). This directly matches the CWE's description.\n\nCWE-400 is considered as a secondary CWE because the blocking of the main thread leads to uncontrolled resource consumption, manifesting as a denial of service. While the vulnerability description highlights the denial of service, the underlying **root cause** is the blocking code.\n\nThe retriever results also suggest CWE-1322.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-1322 is a Base-level CWE, which is preferred for mapping root causes. CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE and could have more specific children, however, it is kept due to the DoS implication.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-470: Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection'): This CWE does not apply as there is no external control of code selection involved.\n*   CWE-617: Reachable Assertion: This CWE does not apply as there is no assertion being triggered.\n*   CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop'): This CWE doesn't match the description of the vulnerability. The issue is not an infinite loop, but a blocking operation.\n*   CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime: There is no memory leak involved.\n*   CWE-193: Off-by-one Error: This CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability.",
