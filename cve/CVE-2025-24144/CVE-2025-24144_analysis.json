The specific nature of the vulnerable code is not provided, so a more specific CWE cannot be determined.\n\nCWE-200 is a Class-level CWE, and while it is generally preferred to select a Base or Variant level CWE, the lack of detail in the vulnerability description makes it difficult to select a more specific CWE with confidence.
