## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10947

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Product:** Interlib Library Cluster Automation Management System
*   **Version:** V2.0.1
*   **Vulnerability:** SQL injection
*   **Location:** `/interlib/order/BatchOrder` module

**Root Cause:**

*   The `/interlib/order/BatchOrder` module fails to properly filter or validate user-supplied SQL input. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization, allowing the execution of arbitrary SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the database, such as:
    *   Library configuration information
    *   User data
*   **Confidentiality Loss:** Sensitive information is exposed to unauthorized parties.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable module.
*   **`bookrecno` parameter:** The SQL injection is triggered through the `bookrecno` parameter in the URL.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers, indicating that no prior access or user account is needed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
*   **No Authentication:** No prior authentication is required.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** Attackers need knowledge of the vulnerable `/interlib/order/BatchOrder` endpoint.

**Technical Details from provided POC:**

*   The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates how to inject SQL by modifying the `bookrecno` parameter:
    `GET /interlib/order/BatchOrder?cmdACT=admin_order&xsl=adminOrder_OrderList.xsl&bookrecno=-1<Encode> and#inject#--</Encode> HTTP/1.1`

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability is classified as a medium risk (中危)
