  "description": "A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. This affects the function MDLImporterParseSkinLump_3DGS_MDL7 of the file assimp/code/AssetLib/MDL/MDLMaterialLoader.cpp. The manipulation leads to **out-of-bounds read**. Attacking locally is a requirement. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The project decided to collect all Fuzzer bugs in a main-issue to address them in the future.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-5204 related content\n\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis relevant to a potential CVE:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-5204 (Placeholder - needs official description)\n\n**Relevance:** The content discusses bugs found by fuzzing and sanitizers in the Assimp library, specifically heap buffer overflows. This is highly relevant to potential security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Details extracted from the content:**\n\n**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   **Heap buffer overflows:** The core issue is heap-buffer-overflows detected by AddressSanitizer (ASan) during fuzzing.\n*   **Missing null termination:** Specifically, the issues stem from reading strings without proper null termination, leading to out-of-bounds reads. The `strlen` function is used on potentially untrusted data without ensuring it's null-terminated.\n\n**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow.\n*   **Improper Input Validation:** Lack of validation to ensure strings are null-terminated before being processed by functions like `strlen`.\n*   **Use of unsafe functions:** Using `strlen` on potentially untrusted data is inherently unsafe.\n\n**3. Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Crash:** The ASan output demonstrates that the vulnerabilities lead to crashes.\n*   **Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE):** While not explicitly stated, heap buffer overflows can potentially be exploited for remote code execution if an attacker can control the data that overflows the buffer.\n\n**4. Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Maliciously crafted files:** The vulnerabilities are triggered by processing specially crafted MDL files (as indicated by the \"MDL\" label and the provided reproducer files).\n*   **Fuzzing:** The bugs were discovered through fuzzing, indicating that automated testing can uncover these vulnerabilities.\n\n**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **File creation/modification:** An attacker needs to be able to create or modify MDL files that are then processed by Assimp.\n*   **Knowledge of file format (MDL):** Understanding the MDL file format would likely be beneficial for crafting a malicious file.\n\n**6. Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation to ensure that strings are properly null-terminated before being used with functions like `strlen`.\n*   **Safe String Handling:** Use safer string handling functions that limit the maximum length of the string being read, or use functions that explicitly specify the buffer size.\n*   **Bounds Checking:** Implement bounds checking to prevent out-of-bounds reads.\n*   **Revert unrelated fix:** The content mentions reverting a commit (`437b484070c074d575422436f3aa7a44df5457c8`) that was masking the issues.\n\n**Specific Issues Mentioned:**\n\n*   **Issue #6176:** Heap OOB read in `MDLImporter::ParseSkinLump_3DGS_MDL7` / `SkipSkinLump`. Reproducers are provided.\n*   **Epic #6128:**  An epic tracking multiple fuzzer/sanitizer bugs.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including ASan output and reproduction steps.\n*   The issues were found through fuzzing, which is a good indicator of potential security vulnerabilities.\n*   The provided reproducer files (`ParseSkinLump-reproducer.zip`, `SkipSkinLump-reproducer.zip`) are valuable for verifying and understanding the vulnerabilities.\n*   The issues are related to the MDL file format.\n*   The issues were temporarily masked by a previous commit and required a revert to be visible again.",
