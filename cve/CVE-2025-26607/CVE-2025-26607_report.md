# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-26607

## Description

WeGIA is an open source Web Manager for Institutions with a focus on Portuguese language users. A SQL Injection vulnerability was discovered in the WeGIA application, `documento_excluir.php` endpoint. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.13 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Weakness:** SQL injection
- **Impact:** execute arbitrary SQL queries
- **Product:** WeGIA
- **Component:** documento_excluir.php endpoint

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The application **does not neutralize** special elements in user input used in an SQL command. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of the vulnerability description to the CWE-89 description. The vulnerability description specifically mentions "SQL Injection" and the analysis of CVE-2025-26607 mentions that the root cause is a lack of validation of user input for the `id_funcionario` parameter, leading to SQL injection. The abstraction level of Base is appropriate as it directly reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper input validation** of the `id_funcionario` parameter in the `documento_excluir.php` endpoint, which leads to the execution of arbitrary SQL queries. This allows unauthorized access to sensitive information, and potentially allows for a denial-of-service attack.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided evidence. The vulnerability description clearly states that there is a **SQL injection** vulnerability in the WeGIA application. The analysis of CVE-2025-26607 confirms that the root cause is the lack of validation of user input in the `documento_excluir.php` endpoint. This directly aligns with CWE-89, which describes the improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command. The evidence is sufficient and the CWE is at the optimal level of specificity.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it **does not neutralize** or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
