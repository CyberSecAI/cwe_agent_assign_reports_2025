It provides a detailed security advisory regarding a SQL Injection vulnerability in the WeGIA application. The content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nLack of validation of user input for the `id_funcionario` parameter in the `documento_excluir.php` endpoint.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection (CWE-89, CWE-284)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Retrieving sensitive data\n*   Denial of Service (DoS) - dropping SQL tables\n*   Potential for arbitrary file upload\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Network-based exploitation via GET request to `/html/funcionario/documento_excluir.php?id_funcionario=[payload]`\n*   Exploitation possible even without being logged in due to improper execution termination after session validation.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   No privileges required.\n*   No user interaction required.\n*   Network access to the vulnerable endpoint.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is patched in version 3.2.13.  Affected versions are <= 3.2.11.\n*   Input validation and sanitization of the `id_funcionario` parameter are required to prevent SQL Injection.\n\n**PoC (Proof of Concept):**\n\n`curl -X GET \"http://localhost:8080/html/funcionario/documento_excluir.php?id_funcionario=1%3D2+AND+(SELECT+299+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))a)\"`\n\n**CVSS v4 Score:**\n\n*   Overall Score: 10.0/10\n*   AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H",

The application **does not neutralize** special elements in user input used in an SQL command. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of the vulnerability description to the CWE-89 description. The vulnerability description specifically mentions \"SQL Injection\" and the analysis of CVE-2025-26607 mentions that the root cause is a lack of validation of user input for the `id_funcionario` parameter, leading to SQL injection. The abstraction level of Base is appropriate as it directly reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper input validation** of the `id_funcionario` parameter in the `documento_excluir.php` endpoint, which leads to the execution of arbitrary SQL queries. This allows unauthorized access to sensitive information, and potentially allows for a denial-of-service attack.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence. The vulnerability description clearly states that there is a **SQL injection** vulnerability in the WeGIA application. The analysis of CVE-2025-26607 confirms that the root cause is the lack of validation of user input in the `documento_excluir.php` endpoint. This directly aligns with CWE-89, which describes the improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command. The evidence is sufficient and the CWE is at the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it **does not neutralize** or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
