  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-45402', description='Picotls is a TLS protocol library that allows users select different crypto backends based on their use case. When parsing a spoofed TLS handshake message, picotls (specifically, bindings within picotls that call the crypto libraries) may attempt to free the same memory twice. This **double free** occurs during the disposal of multiple objects without any intervening calls to malloc Typically, this triggers the malloc implementation to detect the error and abort the process. However, depending on the internals of malloc and the crypto backend being used, the flaw could potentially lead to a **use-after-free** scenario, which might allow for arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability is addressed with commit 9b88159ce763d680e4a13b6e8f3171ae923a535d.', key_phrases={'rootcause': '', 'weakness': ['double free', 'use-after-free'], 'impact': 'arbitrary code execution', 'vector': '', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'Picotls', 'version': '', 'component': ''}, reference_content='The provided content relates to CVE-2024-45402.\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\nA double free vulnerability exists in picotls due to incorrect memory management when handling spoofed TLS handshake messages, specifically during the disposal of multiple objects without intervening calls to malloc.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n- Double free: The same memory is freed twice, which can lead to a crash or potentially a use-after-free condition.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n- Denial of Service (DoS): The double free can trigger a crash due to the malloc implementation detecting the error and aborting the process.\\n- Potential Use-After-Free: Depending on the malloc implementation and crypto backend used, the double free could lead to a use-after-free scenario, which could allow for arbitrary code execution.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n- Network: The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted (spoofed) TLS handshake message over the network.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a service using the vulnerable picotls library. No special privileges are required, nor does the attack require any user interaction.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n- The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of a spoofed TLS handshake message.\\n- The vulnerability exists in the bindings within picotls that call the crypto libraries.\\n- The vulnerability was patched in commit `9b88159` and above in the `picotls` repository.\\n- The CVSS v3 score is 8.6, indicating a high severity vulnerability.\\n- The vulnerability was reported by Kian Kai Ang ([@QUICTester](https://github.com/QUICTester)).', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '415', 'name': 'Double Free', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:double free', 'keyphrase': 'double free', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:use-after-free', 'keyphrase': 'use-after-free', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:arbitrary code execution', 'keyphrase': 'arbitrary code execution', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:Picotls', 'keyphrase': 'Picotls', 'type': 'product'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(642.6006608925766)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '364', 'name': 'Signal Handler Race Condition', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:double free', 'keyphrase': 'double free', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:use-after-free', 'keyphrase': 'use-after-free', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:arbitrary code execution', 'keyphrase': 'arbitrary code execution', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:Picotls', 'keyphrase': 'Picotls', 'type': 'product'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(598.7221918031852)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '362', 'name': \"Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:double free', 'keyphrase': 'double free', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:use-after-free', 'keyphrase': 'use-after-free', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:arbitrary code execution', 'keyphrase': 'arbitrary code execution', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:Picotls', 'keyphrase': 'Picotls', 'type': 'product'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(589.1556511986296)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '828', 'name': 'Signal Handler with Functionality that is not Asynchronous-Safe', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product defines a signal handler that contains code sequences that are not asynchronous-safe, i.e., the functionality is not reentrant, or it can be interrupted.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:double free', 'keyphrase': 'double free', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:use-after-free', 'keyphrase': 'use-after-free', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:arbitrary code execution', 'keyphrase': 'arbitrary code execution', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:Picotls', 'keyphrase': 'Picotls', 'type': 'product'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(569.9675476262248)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '908', 'name': 'Use of Uninitialized Resource', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product uses or accesses a resource that has not been initialized.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:double free', 'keyphrase': 'double free', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:use-after-free', 'keyphrase': 'use-after-free', 'type': 'weakness'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(539.8761427206284)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '190', 'name': 'Integer Overflow or Wraparound', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product performs a calculation that can\\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\\n         the original value.

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    Picotls is a TLS protocol library that allows users select different crypto backends based on their use case. When parsing a spoofed TLS handshake message, picotls (specifically, bindings within picotls that call the crypto libraries) may attempt to free the same memory twice. This **double free** occurs during the disposal of multiple objects without any intervening calls to malloc Typically, this triggers the malloc implementation to detect the error and abort the process. However, depending on the internals of malloc and the crypto backend being used, the flaw could potentially lead to a **use-after-free** scenario, which might allow for arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability is addressed with commit 9b88159ce763d680e4a13b6e8f3171ae923a535d.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## WEAKNESS: 'double free'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1.
