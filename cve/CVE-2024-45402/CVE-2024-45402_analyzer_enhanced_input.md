# Vulnerability Description

    Picotls is a TLS protocol library that allows users select different crypto backends based on their use case. When parsing a spoofed TLS handshake message, picotls (specifically, bindings within picotls that call the crypto libraries) may attempt to free the same memory twice. This **double free** occurs during the disposal of multiple objects without any intervening calls to malloc Typically, this triggers the malloc implementation to detect the error and abort the process. However, depending on the internals of malloc and the crypto backend being used, the flaw could potentially lead to a **use-after-free** scenario, which might allow for arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability is addressed with commit 9b88159ce763d680e4a13b6e8f3171ae923a535d.

    ## WEAKNESS: 'double free'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-415: Double Free (Score: 642.60)

The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations....

### 2. CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition (Score: 598.72)

The product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition....

### 3. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 589.16)

The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently....

### 4. CWE-828: Signal Handler with Functionality that is not Asynchronous-Safe (Score: 569.97)

The product defines a signal handler that contains code sequences that are not asynchronous-safe, i.e., the functionality is not reentrant, or it can be interrupted....

### 5. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 187.05)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...
