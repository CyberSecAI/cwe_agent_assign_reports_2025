  "description": "A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in D-Link DIR-605L 2.13B01. Affected is the function wake_on_lan. The manipulation of the argument mac leads to **command injection**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure. This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.",

CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77, providing a more specific classification for OS Command Injection. There is no information to consider any chain relationship.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of:\n1.  **Root Cause:** Improper neutralization of special elements in the `mac` argument within the `wake_on_lan` function leading to **command injection**.\n2.  **Impact:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary OS commands on the affected system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that manipulating the `mac` argument in the `wake_on_lan` function leads to **command injection**. This is strong evidence for classifying the vulnerability as related to command injection.\n\nThe Retriever Results list CWE-77 and CWE-78 as top candidates. CWE-77 is a Class-level CWE, while CWE-78 is a Base-level CWE. Since the vulnerability specifically involves OS commands, CWE-78, \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\", is the more appropriate and specific choice.\n\nThe selection of CWE-78 is further supported by its description: \"The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\" This aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description, where the `mac` argument (externally-influenced input) is not properly neutralized, leading to OS command execution.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but deemed less relevant:\n\n*   CWE-89 (SQL Injection) - Not applicable as the vulnerability involves OS commands, not SQL queries.\n*   CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting) - Not applicable as the vulnerability does not involve injecting scripts into web pages.\n*   CWE-426 (Untrusted Search Path) - Not directly relevant, as the vulnerability involves improper neutralization rather than an untrusted search path.\n\nThe choice of CWE-78 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) and directly reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1.0\n**Source**: alternate_terms\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended command when it is sent to a downstream component.
