Since the provided description only mentions \"**improper access control**\" without specifying whether it's due to missing authentication (CWE-306) or improper authorization (CWE-285 or its children), CWE-284 is the most appropriate, albeit general, classification.

The vulnerability description key phrases clearly indicates \"**improper access control**\" as the root cause.\n\nThe primary CWE selection is based on the direct statement of \"**Improper access control**\" in the vulnerability description. The CWE Classification Guidance also suggests using CWE-284 when the access control failure exists, but the root cause is unclear. The fact that the fix involves adding proper validation logic further supports this, but doesn't give enough information to choose a more specific CWE.\n\nCWE-284 is selected because it is the most accurate representation of the described weakness, given the limited information available. While other CWEs like CWE-280 and CWE-306 were considered, they require more specific evidence that is not provided in the description.
