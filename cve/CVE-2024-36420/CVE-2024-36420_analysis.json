  "description": "Flowise is a drag & drop user interface to build a customized large language model flow. In version 1.4.3 of Flowise, the `/api/v1/openai-assistants-file` endpoint in `index.ts` is vulnerable to arbitrary file read due to **lack of sanitization** of the `fileName` body parameter. No known patches for this issue are available.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36420:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of the `fileName` body parameter in the `/api/v1/openai-assistants-file` endpoint.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Path Injection:** The application directly uses the provided `fileName` from the request body to construct a file path, without proper validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the path, potentially accessing files outside the intended directory.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary File Read:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read arbitrary files from the Flowise server's file system. This could include sensitive configuration files, user data, or other confidential information.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker can send a crafted POST request to the `/api/v1/openai-assistants-file` endpoint, including a malicious `fileName` parameter in the request body, to traverse directories and read arbitrary files.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.\n*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated if the default unauthenticated configuration is used.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*   This vulnerability is identified as `GHSL-2023-232`.\n*   The vulnerability exists in the `index.ts` file of the Flowise server.\n*   The vulnerable code snippet is located around line 982, constructing the file path using `path.join(getUserHome(), '.flowise', 'openai-assistant', req.body.fileName)`.\n*   The vulnerability is present in version `v1.4.3` of Flowise.\n*   This vulnerability may be chained with XSS and CORS vulnerabilities to allow attackers without direct access to the Flowise server to read files.",

CWE-73, external control of file name or path, is considered as a related weakness where the filename or path is influenced by user input. CWE-22 is a specific case of CWE-73, where the goal is to stay within a restricted directory but fails.

The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE details strongly supports CWE-22 as the primary weakness. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"The vulnerability stems from a **lack of sanitization** of the `fileName` body parameter in the `/api/v1/openai-assistants-file` endpoint.\" Also, it states: \"The application directly uses the provided `fileName` from the request body to construct a file path, without proper validation or sanitization.
