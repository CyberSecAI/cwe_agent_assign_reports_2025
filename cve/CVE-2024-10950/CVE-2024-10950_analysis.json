  "description": "In binary-husky/gpt_academic version <= 3.83, the plugin `CodeInterpreter` is vulnerable to code injection caused by prompt injection. The root cause is the execution of user-provided prompts that generate untrusted code without a sandbox, allowing the execution of parts of the LLM-generated code. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the application backend server, potentially gaining full control of the server.",

This leads to the generation of untrusted code and subsequent execution, resulting in remote code execution (RCE). The chain is:\n\n1.  **CWE-1427**: Improper Neutralization of Input Used for LLM Prompting (Root Cause)\n2.  Execution of LLM-generated code (Impact)\n3.  Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Final Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **improper neutralization** of input used for LLM prompting, leading to **code injection** and remote code execution. This is directly supported by the vulnerability description: \"The root cause is the execution of user-provided prompts that generate untrusted code without a sandbox, allowing the execution of parts of the LLM-generated code.\" The description clearly identifies the prompt injection as the root cause.\n\n**CWE-1427** directly addresses this root cause, as it focuses on the **improper neutralization** of input used for LLM prompting. This CWE is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\n**CWE-94** was also considered but deemed less specific. While the vulnerability ultimately results in **code injection**, the root cause is the prompt injection that bypasses intended restrictions. Therefore, **CWE-1427** is the more accurate primary mapping.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
