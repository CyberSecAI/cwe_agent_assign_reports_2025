This allows an attacker to provide a large value for the parameter.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\n**Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by specifying a large value for the `p2c` parameter within a token.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted token with a large `p2c` value to the affected system. No specific privileges or positions are mentioned.\n\n**Affected Versions:**\n* Apache CXF before 4.0.5\n* Apache CXF 3.6.x before 3.6.4\n* Apache CXF 3.5.x before 3.5.9\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.5 (HIGH) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n*   NetApp products that include the vulnerable Apache CXF are also affected. A list of the affected NetApp products is included in the second document. NetApp is also providing patches for these products.\n*   Public discussion of the vulnerability is known.",

CWE-1284 is a more specific type of **improper input validation**, dealing specifically with the validation of quantities. The vulnerability description highlights an **improper input validation** of a parameter that represents a quantity, justifying the selection of CWE-1284. CWE-1284 can also precede CWE-400, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, when the **improperly validated** quantity leads to resource exhaustion. This relationship strengthens the argument for including CWE-400 as a secondary weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe1284 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1284 primary\n    class cwe20,cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **improper input validation** of the `p2c` parameter (CWE-1284). This leads to the acceptance of a large value, which subsequently causes a denial-of-service attack due to excessive resource consumption (CWE-400). The chain is: CWE-1284 (Root Cause) -> CWE-400 (Impact).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **improper input validation** as the root cause. The retriever results suggested CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) as a candidate, but it is a Class-level CWE and is discouraged. The description mentions a \"large value\" for a parameter, so CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is a better, more specific match because it deals with the validation of quantities. The vulnerability description clearly states that the **improper input validation** of the `p2c` parameter leads to a denial-of-service attack. This suggests that the large value leads to excessive resource consumption, making CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) a relevant secondary CWE. The final selection of CWEs is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the relationships between the CWEs. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-1284 being a Base-level CWE and a specific type of **improper input validation**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not chosen because the vulnerability is not related to an authentication algorithm implementation.*\n\n## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input or data, but it does\n        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the\n        properties that are required to process the data safely and\n        correctly.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287].
