## Vulnerability Description
There exists a security vulnerability in Jettys ThreadLimitHandler.getRemote() which can be exploited by unauthorized users to cause remote denial-of-service (DoS) attack. By repeatedly sending crafted requests, attackers can trigger OutofMemory errors and exhaust the servers memory.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** remote denial-of-service (DoS)
- **vector:** crafted requests
- **attacker:** unauthorized users
- **product:** Jetty
- **component:** ThreadLimitHandler.getRemote()

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `ThreadLimitHandler.getRemote()` method within the Jetty server. The specific details of why this method is vulnerable are not detailed in the text but it results in excessive memory usage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption):** The core issue is that the `ThreadLimitHandler.getRemote()` method can be abused to consume excessive server memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a remote denial-of-service attack by repeatedly sending crafted requests. This leads to `OutOfMemory` errors and server exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be located anywhere with network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Repeated crafted requests:** Attackers need to send specifically crafted requests repeatedly.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Jetty server including 9.3.12 to 9.4.55, 10.0.0 to 10.0.23, 11.0.0 to 11.0.23, and 12.0.0 to 12.0.8.
*   The fix for this vulnerability has been released in Jetty versions 9.4.56, 10.0.24, 11.0.24, and 12.0.9.
*   A workaround is to avoid using `ThreadLimitHandler` and to consider using `QoSHandler` instead.
*   The CVSS score is 5.9 with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H, indicating a moderate severity with high impact on availability.
