## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net ethernet ti am65-cpsw Fix NAPI registration sequence **Registering the interrupts for TX or RX DMA Channels prior to registering their respective NAPI callbacks** can result in a **NULL pointer dereference**. This is seen in practice as a random occurrence since it depends on the randomness associated with the generation of traffic by Linux and the reception of traffic from the wire.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Registering the interrupts for TX or RX DMA Channels prior to registering their respective NAPI callbacks**
- **weakness:** **NULL pointer dereference**
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** net ethernet ti am65-cpsw
