The vulnerability description explicitly states a \"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability\". The secondary weakness is **CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'))**, a base level weakness, as the CSRF vulnerability allows for Stored XSS. This indicates a chain where a successful CSRF attack can lead to stored XSS due to **improper neutralization of input**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe352 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF))** as the root cause, allowing an attacker to force a user to perform unwanted actions. This leads to **CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'))**, since the actions triggered through the CSRF attack result in stored XSS, implying that the input is not properly neutralized.\n  - The **Primary CWE** is **CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF))** which identifies the issue that led to the vulnerability i.e. the first in the \"Vulnerability Chain\".\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary. The description explicitly mentions a **Cross-Site Request Forgery** (CSRF) vulnerability leading to Stored XSS. The reference links confirm CSRF as the root cause. This strong evidence justifies assigning **CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF))** as the primary CWE with high confidence. The subsequent Stored XSS due to the CSRF attack is classified as **CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'))**.
