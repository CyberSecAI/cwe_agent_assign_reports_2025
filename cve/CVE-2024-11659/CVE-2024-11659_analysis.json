  "description": "A vulnerability was found in EnGenius ENH1350EXT, ENS500-AC and ENS620EXT up to 20241118 and classified as critical. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /admin/network/diag_iperf. The manipulation of the argument iperf leads to **command injection**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `diag_iperf` interface of ENGENIUS routers. Specifically, the `iperf` parameter is directly passed to a system command execution function without adequate validation or escaping.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. The `iperf` parameter, intended for configuring iperf network testing, is instead used to inject arbitrary shell commands.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the webserver process. This can lead to complete system compromise.\n*   **System Takeover:** The attacker can potentially gain root access to the router.\n*   **Data Theft/Modification:** With system access, the attacker can steal sensitive data, modify configurations, or install malware.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is accessed via the `/admin/network/diag_iperf` interface, which is part of the web-based management interface of the router.\n*   **HTTP Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request with the injected command within the `iperf` parameter.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the router's web interface.\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the router or have a way to reach the router's web interface.\n*  **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint**: The attacker needs to be aware of the `/admin/network/diag_iperf` endpoint and the vulnerable parameter.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n*   The lua code shows that the `iperf` parameter is directly used in the `diag_command` function, leading to the injection vulnerability.\n*   The provided HTTP GET request demonstrates how the `iperf` parameter is used to inject a `ping` command for DNS exfiltration as a proof of concept, which will likely allow for more malicious commands to be executed.\n*   The affected devices include models such as ENH1350EXT, ENS500-AC, and ens620ext\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n* The document mentions that the vendor was unresponsive to vulnerability reports.\n* The document details that the vulnerability is present in all firmware versions of affected models.\n\nThis vulnerability allows for a malicious actor to execute any command they wish by injecting it into the iperf parameter.",
