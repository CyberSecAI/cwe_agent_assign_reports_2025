CWE-614, a variant of CWE-319, is also considered because it involves a specific case related to cookies. The parent-child relationship between CWE-319 and CWE-614 indicates a potential for increased specificity. The vulnerability description focuses on the failure to enable HTTP Strict Transport Security, which directly relates to the transmission of sensitive information without encryption.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n    \n    cwe614 -->|CHILDOF| cwe319\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe614 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security**, leading to **cleartext transmission of sensitive information**, which can then be intercepted by an attacker leading to **sensitive information disclosure**.\n  - The Root Cause is the **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security**\n  - The Weakness that follows is **cleartext transmission of sensitive information**\n  - The Impact is **sensitive information disclosure**\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description which states a **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security** that could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. The retriever results and the vulnerability description point to **cleartext transmission of sensitive information**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-319 as the primary CWE is strongly supported by the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions the **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security**, leading to potential **cleartext transmission**. The relationship graph reinforces this by showing CWE-319 as a parent to more specific cookie-related weaknesses.\n\nCWE-319 is chosen as the primary CWE because it accurately represents the root cause, which is the **cleartext transmission of sensitive information** due to the **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security**. While other CWEs like CWE-614 are related, CWE-319 is more general and directly addresses the core issue. CWE-614 is a good secondary candidate because the HSTS **failure to properly enable HTTP Strict Transport Security** would also impact cookies.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
