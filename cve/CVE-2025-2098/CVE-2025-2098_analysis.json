  "description": "Fast CAD Reader application on MacOS was found to be installed with **incorrect file permissions** (rwxrwxrwx). This is inconsistent with standard macOS security practices, where applications should have drwxr-xr-x permissions. Incorrect permissions allow for **Dylib Hijacking**. Guest account, other users and applications can exploit this vulnerability for privilege escalation. This issue affects Fast CAD Reader in possibly all versions since the vendor has not responded to our messages. The tested version was 4.1.5",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-2098 based on provided content:\n\n**1. Verification:**\n\nThe content from cert.pl directly addresses CVE-2025-2098, detailing a vulnerability in the Fast CAD Reader application. This confirms relevance.\n\n**2. Extracted Information:**\n\n* **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect file permissions (rwxrwxrwx) assigned to the Fast CAD Reader application on macOS, deviating from standard macOS security practices (drwxr-xr-x).\n* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266).  This allows for Dylib Hijacking.\n* **Impact of exploitation:** Privilege escalation. Guest accounts, other users, and applications can exploit the vulnerability.\n* **Attack vectors:** Dylib Hijacking.\n* **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with access to the system (even a guest account) can exploit the vulnerability.\n* **Mitigation or fix:** The report does not specify a fix, but implies that correcting the file permissions to standard macOS settings would mitigate the vulnerability. The vendor has not responded to messages regarding the issue.\n* **Vulnerable versions:** All versions through 4.1.5.\n* **Report source:** Report to CERT Polska.\n\n**3. Additional Details (compared to a placeholder CVE description):**\n\nThe provided content offers significantly more detail than a placeholder CVE description would. It specifies the CWE, explains the root cause, details the impact, and identifies the attack vector. It also provides information about the reporting process and the lack of vendor response.",

The application was installed with **incorrect file permissions**. |\n| CWE-266 | Incorrect Privilege Assignment | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. Guest account, other users and applications can exploit this vulnerability for privilege escalation. |\n| CWE-427 | Uncontrolled Search Path Element | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. This vulnerability allows for **Dylib Hijacking**. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-732, which is a Class-level weakness related to incorrect permission assignments. This is supported by the description stating the application was installed with incorrect file permissions. CWE-266 is a Base-level weakness related to incorrect privilege assignment. It is considered due to the potential for privilege escalation. CWE-427 is a Base-level weakness related to uncontrolled search path elements. It is considered due to the possibility of Dylib Hijacking.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe427[\"CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\"]\n\n    cwe427 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe732 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe266 -->|CHILDOF| cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe732 primary\n    class cwe266,cwe427 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect file permissions** (CWE-732), leading to a **Dylib Hijacking** vulnerability (CWE-427), and ultimately resulting in privilege escalation (CWE-266).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-732 as the primary weakness due to the **incorrect file permissions** being the root cause. The supporting evidence from the vulnerability description clearly states that \"Fast CAD Reader application on MacOS was found to be installed with **incorrect file permissions** (rwxrwxrwx).\" The retriever results also list CWE-732 as the top combined result. The guidance on privileges vs. permissions also suggests that when dealing with assignment of permissions for resources, CWE-732 is a good fit.\n\nCWE-266 and CWE-427 are secondary candidates because the **incorrect file permissions** can lead to privilege escalation and **Dylib Hijacking**, respectively. These are consequences of the root cause.\n\nCWE-732 is selected at the Class level because it directly addresses the **incorrect permission assignment**. While more specific variants might exist, the provided information does not offer enough details to narrow down the selection further. CWE-266 and CWE-427 are selected because they are at the Base level of abstraction which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
