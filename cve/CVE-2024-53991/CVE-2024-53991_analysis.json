  "description": "Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. This vulnerability only impacts Discourse instances configured to use `FileStoreLocalStore` which means uploads and backups are stored locally on disk. If an attacker knows the name of the Discourse backup file, the attacker can trick nginx into sending the Discourse backup file with a well crafted request. This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade can either 1. Download all local backups on to another storage device, disable the `enable_backups` site setting and delete all backups until the site has been upgraded to pull in the fix. Or 2. Change the `backup_location` site setting to `s3` so that backups are stored and downloaded directly from S3.",

  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a misconfiguration in Nginx that allows an attacker to potentially access Discourse backup files when using `FileStore::LocalStore` if the attacker knows the name of the backup file.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is related to the handling of backup files when stored locally. Nginx can be tricked into serving these files due to a lack of proper access control or path validation.\n- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to a confidentiality breach by exposing backup files. These backup files likely contain sensitive information, including database content and application configurations.\n- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, requiring the attacker to craft a specific HTTP request to retrieve the backup file.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to know the name of the backup file and must be able to send HTTP requests to the server. No privileges or user interaction are required to exploit this vulnerability.",

CWE-425 is considered as a secondary CWE, where the attacker uses a **direct request** to access the sensitive information. The relationship between these CWEs isn't explicitly defined in terms of parent-child or chaining, but they are related in the sense that CWE-425 could lead to CWE-538 if authorization is not properly handled.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe538[\"CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    \n    cwe425 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe538\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe538 primary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **misconfiguration** in Nginx which leads to **sensitive information (backups) being stored in an externally accessible directory**. An attacker then crafts a **direct request** to access these files, resulting in a **confidentiality breach**.\n\n*   Root Cause: **Misconfiguration** in Nginx leading to backups in a public directory.\n*   Weakness: CWE-538 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory.\n*   Attack Vector: CWE-425 Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n*   Impact: Confidentiality breach due to exposure of backup files.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting vulnerability. The primary CWE, CWE-538, directly aligns with the vulnerability description of backups containing sensitive information being accessible due to a misconfiguration.\n\nThe retriever results suggested several CWEs related to sensitive information exposure, improper authorization, and input validation. While some of these (e.g., CWE-201, CWE-79) have relevance, CWE-538 provides the most accurate and specific description of the vulnerability. CWE-425 Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') represents a secondary aspect of the attack.\n\nThe final decision is based on the following evidence:\n\n*   \"The vulnerability stems from a misconfiguration in Nginx that allows an attacker to potentially access Discourse backup files when using `FileStore::LocalStore`\"\n*   \"Nginx can be tricked into serving these files due to a **lack of proper access control** or path validation.\"\n*   \"Successful exploitation can lead to a confidentiality breach by exposing backup files. These backup files likely contain sensitive information, including database content and application configurations.\"\n\nCWE-538 aligns directly with these statements, as it describes the **insertion of sensitive information** (backup files) into an **externally-accessible file or directory**.\n\nCWE-425 is also relevant, as the attacker uses a **direct request** to access these files.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity (Base) to represent the vulnerability, as they accurately describe the root cause and the attack vector.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data): While sensitive information is exposed, it's not necessarily being *sent* but rather directly accessed from a file.\n*   CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')): This is not an XSS vulnerability.\n*   CWE-285 (Improper Authorization): Although authorization is relevant, CWE-425 Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') is more precise.\n*   CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password): Not specifically related to password storage, but more general sensitive data.\n*   CWE-184 (Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs): Not directly related to input validation.",
