  "query": "A vulnerability has been found in Fujifilm Business Innovation Apeos C3070, Apeos C5570 and Apeos C6580 up to 24.8.28 and classified as critical. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file /home/index.html#hashHome of the component Web Interface. The manipulation leads to improper authorization. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The real existence of this vulnerability is still doubted at the moment. The vendor explains that during technical verification it is not possible to reproduce any active actions like reboots which were mentioned in the original researcher disclosure.",
