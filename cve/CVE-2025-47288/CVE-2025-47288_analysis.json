It represents the high-level issue of exposing sensitive information. A more specific cause might be related to authorization, hence CWE-862 is considered as a secondary issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect** configuration or **missing** authorization that leads to the exposure of group members to non-group members.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary issue is the exposure of sensitive information (**group members**) to unauthorized actors (**non-group members**). The root cause could be a **missing** authorization check or an **incorrect** access control configuration.\n\nThe vulnerability description states \"if there was a policy posted to a public topic that was tied to a private group then the group members could be shown to non-group members.\" This indicates a failure to properly restrict access to the group member list based on group membership.\n\nCWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] directly matches the impact, as the group members' information is sensitive and should not be exposed to non-group members.\n\nCWE-862 [Missing Authorization] might be the underlying cause, as the application **fails** to properly authorize access to the group member list.\n\nThe retriever results also suggest other potential CWEs such as CWE-359 [Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor] and CWE-201 [Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data]. However, CWE-200 is a more general and suitable match for the described impact.\n\nCWE-285 [Improper Authorization] is discouraged as a mapping option since it's a high-level CWE.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe primary CWE is CWE-200, representing the impact of the vulnerability. CWE-862 is a secondary CWE representing a potential root cause.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538:

the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing

mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 690.18\n**Source**:
