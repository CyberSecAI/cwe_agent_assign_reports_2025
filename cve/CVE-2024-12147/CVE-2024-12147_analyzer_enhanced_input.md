## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in Netgear R6900 1.0.1.26_1.0.20. It has been declared as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file upgrade_check.cgi of the component HTTP Header Handler. The manipulation of the argument Content-Length leads to **buffer overflow**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **buffer overflow**
- **vector:** manipulation of Content-Length argument
- **product:** Netgear R6900
- **version:** 1.0.1.26_1.0.20
- **component:** upgrade_check.cgi

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `sub_18334` function within the `/usr/sbin/httpd` binary of the Netgear R6900v1 router firmware. The vulnerability stems from an incorrect use of `memcpy`. The size parameter passed to `memcpy` is derived from user-controlled input, and this calculated size can be larger than the destination buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow:** The `memcpy` function is used to copy data into a fixed-size buffer, and the size of the copy operation is not correctly validated, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.
    *   **Unvalidated User Input:** The size parameter `v2` for `memcpy` is based on bytes read from the input `src`. This size is not checked against the buffer `s`, which could be overwritten leading to a buffer overflow.
*  **Vulnerable Function:** `sub_18334` within `/usr/sbin/httpd`
* **Vulnerable Firmware:** R6900-V1.0.1.26\_1.0.20

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Service Crash:** Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a crash of the `httpd` service, rendering the router's web interface inaccessible.
*   **Remote Code Execution (Likely):** While the provided text specifically demonstrates a crash, buffer overflows are often exploitable for arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to potentially gain control of the router.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/upgrade_check.cgi` endpoint.
*   **Specific Content:** The POST request needs to include a specific string `name="mtenFWUpload"\r\n\r\n` in the header. The content of the request includes a crafted string that triggers the vulnerable `memcpy` call.
*  **Bypass Conditions:** The content of the request must begin with `*#$^`, followed by a null byte `\x00` and 3 more arbitrary bytes to control the size of the memcpy. This bypasses an initial check in the vulnerable code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the router's web interface (typically accessible on the local network).
*   **HTTP Request Crafting:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests with specific headers and crafted content to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Details from Analysis**

*   **Bypass Logic:** The exploit requires crafting the initial part of the payload as `*#$^\x00\xFF\xFF\xFF` to bypass an initial check. The vulnerability exists because `memcpy` uses the bytes following the null byte as the size argument without any validation.
*   **`upgrade_check.cgi` Endpoint:** The vulnerability is exposed via the `/upgrade_check.cgi` endpoint, typically used for firmware upgrades.
*   **Verification Steps:** The provided text describes how to verify the vulnerability: Accessing the router's web interface, sending the crafted POST request to `/upgrade_check.cgi`, and observing the crash of the `httpd` service after sending the exploit.
* **Proof of concept:** The provided python script shows how to exploit the vulnerability, this script is executed against the vulnerable router to demonstrate the crash.
*  **`v117` variable:**  The document highlights that the code path leading to the overflow is protected by a conditional jump using variable `v117`. The vulnerability is triggered when the value is 1, even though the value is set to zero earlier in the code. This means that the normal code path does not lead to the vulnerable memcpy, and the vulnerable branch is activated only when crafted data is present in the request.

This detailed analysis provides more specific information than a typical CVE description and shows a working proof of concept.
