# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-28897

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | 0.9 | Compound | Primary CWE | Allowed |
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 0.8 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), a compound weakness. The exploitation of CSRF leads to Stored XSS, which is represented by CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'). CWE-79 is a base weakness. CWE-352 can precede CWE-79 in a vulnerability chain.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper CSRF protection** (CWE-352), which allows an attacker to trick a user into performing unwanted actions, in this case, injecting malicious scripts. This leads to **Stored XSS** (CWE-79), where the injected script is stored on the server and executed when other users view the affected page.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is the **improper CSRF protection** (CWE-352) which allows for the injection of a stored XSS. The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** identifies both "improper CSRF protection" and "Stored XSS" which is evidence for selecting both CWEs. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also supports the presence of both CSRF and XSS.

CWE-352 is the root cause, as without it, the XSS injection would not be possible through this attack vector. CWE-79 is a consequence of the successful exploitation of CWE-352.

The retriever results show CWE-79 and CWE-352 as top candidates, lending further weight to their selection.

Other CWEs were considered but ultimately not selected:

*   CWE-425 Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'): While related to access control issues, it doesn't fully capture the CSRF aspect, which involves tricking a user into making a request they didn't intend to make.
*   CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type: Not relevant, as the vulnerability does not involve file uploads.
*   CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect'): Not relevant, as the vulnerability does not involve redirection.
*   CWE-942 Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains: Not relevant, as it focuses on cross-domain policy issues, not CSRF.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-352 being a compound weakness that accurately represents the CSRF issue, and CWE-79 being a base weakness that reflects the resulting XSS vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
