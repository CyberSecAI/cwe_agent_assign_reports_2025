CWE-787 represents the out-of-bounds write condition which is a common result of buffer overflows. CWE-120 is a more general case of buffer overflow, but the description specifically mentions a stack overflow, making CWE-121 more appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119    \n    cwe121 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    cwe120 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe787,cwe120 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **stack overflow** (CWE-121) due to a crafted POST request. This leads to an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787), which allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is clearly identified as a **stack overflow** in the vulnerability description. The retriever results and CWE specifications strongly support CWE-121 as the most appropriate mapping. While CWE-120 is a relevant parent, CWE-121 provides more specificity aligning with the provided evidence. CWE-787 is included as a secondary weakness since a buffer overflow leads to an out-of-bounds write. The final decision is based on the explicit mention of a stack overflow and the supporting retriever results, providing a high confidence in the mapping.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why this CWE was selected:** The vulnerability description states \"stack overflow\" as the **weakness**.
