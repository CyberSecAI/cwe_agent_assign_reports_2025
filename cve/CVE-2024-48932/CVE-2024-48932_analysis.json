  "description": "ZimaOS is a fork of CasaOS, an operating system for Zima devices and x86-64 systems with UEFI. In version 1.2.4 and all prior versions, the API endpoint `http///v1/users/name` allows unauthenticated users to access sensitive information, such as usernames, without any authorization. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to enumerate usernames and leverage them for further attacks, such as brute-force or phishing campaigns. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.",

The API endpoint does not require any authentication for accessing sensitive user information. |\n| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.9 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability results in the exposure of usernames to unauthorized users. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **lack of authentication** (CWE-306), which directly leads to the **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200). CWE-306 is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), but CWE-306 is more specific because it explicitly indicates the complete absence of authentication. CWE-200 is a class-level CWE, and while it describes the impact, it is less specific than the root cause, which is the **missing authentication**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** (CWE-306) for the API endpoint, which allows unauthenticated users to access sensitive information, leading to **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200). The chain highlights the direct impact of the **missing authentication**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis focuses on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **missing authentication** for a critical function (CWE-306). The vulnerability description explicitly states that the API endpoint allows unauthenticated users to access sensitive information. This aligns with the CWE-306 description. The subsequent **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200) is a direct consequence of the **missing authentication**.\n\nThe retriever results suggest other potential CWEs, such as CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). However, these CWEs are not applicable because the vulnerability does not involve any authorization checks. The API endpoint simply lacks authentication, making CWE-306 the most appropriate choice.\n\nThe mapping guidance for authentication vs. authorization clarifies that CWE-306 is suitable when there is no identity validation. The technical impact of the vulnerability is the **exposure of sensitive information**, but the root cause is the **lack of authentication**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-306 is a base-level CWE that accurately represents the **missing authentication**, while CWE-200 describes the resulting **information disclosure**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced
