## Vulnerability Description
ZimaOS is a fork of CasaOS, an operating system for Zima devices and x86-64 systems with UEFI. In version 1.2.4 and all prior versions, the API endpoint `http///v1/users/name` allows unauthenticated users to access sensitive information, such as usernames, without any authorization. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to enumerate usernames and leverage them for further attacks, such as brute-force or phishing campaigns. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **information disclosure**
- **impact:** access sensitive information and enumerate usernames and phishing
- **attacker:** unauthenticated users
- **product:** ZimaOS
- **version:** 1.2.4 and all prior versions
- **component:** API endpoint http///v1/users/name

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The ZimaOS API endpoint `/v1/users/name` allows unauthenticated access to user information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Authentication:** The API endpoint does not require any authentication or authorization.
- **Information Disclosure:** The endpoint exposes usernames, which are considered sensitive information.
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:**  The vulnerability allows anyone to directly access the user data without proper access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User Enumeration:** Attackers can gather a list of valid usernames.
- **Brute-Force Attacks:** The enumerated usernames can be used in brute-force password attacks.
- **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can use the usernames for targeted phishing campaigns.
- **Further Exploitation:** The username information can be used to facilitate exploitation of other vulnerabilities, especially in systems using username-based access controls.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be carried out over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable ZimaOS server.
- No authentication or special privileges are required.
- No user interaction is required for the exploitation.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects ZimaOS versions ≤ v1.2.4
- The patched version is 1.2.5
- The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" severity with a CVSS score of 5.3.
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).
- A PoC exploit is provided, demonstrating how to obtain the username data.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| No identity check (no login)                               | CWE-306        |
| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
