This is due to a **lack of validation** and **missing capability check** on user-supplied data in the lwp_update_password_action function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update their role to any other role, including Administrator. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 1.7.40. The login with phone number pro plugin was required to exploit the vulnerability in versions 1.7.40 - 1.7.49.', key_phrases={'rootcause': ['lack of validation', 'missing capability check'], 'weakness': '', 'impact': 'privilege escalation', 'vector': '', 'attacker': 'authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access and above', 'product': 'Login with phone number plugin for WordPress', 'version': 'up to and including 1.7.49', 'component': 'lwp_update_password_action function'}, reference_content='The provided content is related to CVE-2024-6482.\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a missing capability check and a lack of validation on user-supplied data within the `lwp_update_password_action` function.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n- **Improper Privilege Management**: The plugin fails to properly validate user input and check user capabilities before allowing them to update their user role. This allows an authenticated user with minimal privileges to escalate their role to administrator.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n- **Privilege Escalation**: An attacker with subscriber-level access can gain administrator privileges, allowing them to perform administrative tasks such as taking over the website.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n- Authenticated attackers (Subscriber+) can exploit the vulnerability.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n- An attacker needs to have at least a subscriber level access.\\n- The attacker can send a crafted request to the `lwp_update_password_action` function in order to modify their own user role.\\n- Exploitation in versions 1.7.40 - 1.7.49 required the pro plugin.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {},

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    The Login with phone number plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.49. This is due to a **lack of validation** and **missing capability check** on user-supplied data in the lwp_update_password_action function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update their role to any other role, including Administrator. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 1.7.40. The login with phone number pro plugin was required to exploit the vulnerability in versions 1.7.40 - 1.7.49.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'lack of validation'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
