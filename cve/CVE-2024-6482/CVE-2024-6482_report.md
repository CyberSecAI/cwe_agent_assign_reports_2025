# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-6482

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-6482

## Description

The Login with phone number plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.49. This is due to a **lack of validation** and **missing capability check** on user-supplied data in the lwp_update_password_action function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update their role to any other role, including Administrator. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 1.7.40. The login with phone number pro plugin was required to exploit the vulnerability in versions 1.7.40 - 1.7.49.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** ['lack of validation', 'missing capability check']
- **Impact:** privilege escalation
- **Attacker:** authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access and above
- **Product:** Login with phone number plugin for WordPress
- **Version:** up to and including 1.7.49
- **Component:** lwp_update_password_action function

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-269 | Improper Privilege Management | 1.0 | Class | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management**, because the plugin **does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges** for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor. The secondary weakness is **CWE-862 Missing Authorization**, because the product **does not perform an authorization check** when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. Both CWE-269 and CWE-862 are Class-level CWEs, and per MITRE mapping guidance, we should try to identify Base-level children that would be more appropriate. However, based on the information provided, there is not enough information to identify a more specific CWE.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of root cause and weaknesses for the Vulnerability Description is as follows:
1.  **ROOT CAUSE**: **Lack of validation** and **missing capability check** within the `lwp_update_password_action` function.
2.  **WEAKNESS**: **CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management** due to the product not properly assigning, modifying, tracking, or checking privileges.
3.  **IMPACT**: Privilege escalation, allowing authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access to gain Administrator privileges.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management**. The vulnerability description clearly states that the plugin's **lack of validation** and **missing capability check** within the `lwp_update_password_action` function allows authenticated attackers to update their role to Administrator. This directly aligns with the definition of **CWE-269**, which involves a product not properly managing privileges, creating an unintended sphere of control. While other CWEs like **CWE-862 Missing Authorization** are also relevant, **CWE-269** more precisely captures the root cause of the privilege escalation. The **missing capability check** directly leads to **improper privilege management**, enabling the escalation. This assessment is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description, specifically the phrases "**lack of validation**" and "**missing capability check**" in the `lwp_update_password_action` function, which directly enable privilege escalation.

Relevant CWE Information:
# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment
