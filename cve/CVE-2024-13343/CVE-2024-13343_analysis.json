CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is a class-level CWE. The retriever results showed that CWE-862 is the best match. The vulnerability is due to a **missing capability check**. CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) is a base-level CWE and a potential related weakness, where privileges are incorrectly assigned.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n\n    cwe266 -->|CHILDOF| cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    cwe862 -->|PARENT OF| cwe266\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe266 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing capability check** (CWE-862), which allows authenticated attackers with low-level access to elevate their privileges. The chain can be represented as follows:\n\nMissing Authorization (CWE-862) -> Privilege Escalation (Impact).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed towards authorization issues. The **missing capability check** is the key indicator. The retriever results suggested CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) as the top candidate. The vulnerability description explicitly states a **missing capability check**, which aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-862. CWE-266 was also considered as a secondary weakness related to privilege management.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity. CWE-862 captures the root cause, while CWE-266 identifies how privileges are incorrectly assigned. The evidence from the vulnerability description supports these classifications.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1265.41\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\nCWE-862: Missing Authorization\n\nCWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment",
