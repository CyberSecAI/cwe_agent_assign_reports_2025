## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved thermal/debugfs Fix two locking issues with thermal zone debug With the current thermal zone locking arrangement in the debugfs code, user space can open the mitigations file for a thermal zone before the zones debugfs pointer is set which will result in a **NULL pointer dereference** in tze_seq_start(). Moreover, thermal_debug_tz_remove() is not called under the thermal zone lock, so it can run in parallel with the other functions accessing the thermal zones struct thermal_debugfs object. Then, it may clear tz->debugfs after one of those functions has checked it and the struct thermal_debugfs object may be freed prematurely. To address the first problem, pass a pointer to the thermal zones struct thermal_debugfs object to debugfs_create_file() in thermal_debug_tz_add() and make tze_seq_start(), tze_seq_next(), tze_seq_stop(), and tze_seq_show() retrieve it from s->private instead of a pointer to the thermal zone object. This will ensure that tz_debugfs will be valid across the mitigations file accesses until thermal_debugfs_remove_id() called by thermal_debug_tz_remove() removes that file. To address the second problem, use tz->lock in thermal_debug_tz_remove() around the tz->debugfs value check (in case the same thermal zone is removed at the same time in two different threads) and its reset to NULL.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the patch:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from two locking issues in the thermal debugfs code:
1.  **Race Condition on `tz->debugfs`:** User space could open the "mitigations" file for a thermal zone before the `tz->debugfs` pointer is set, leading to a NULL pointer dereference in `tze_seq_start()`. This is because the debugfs file creation was happening after the `tz->debugfs` assignment, so a user space process could trigger the file operations before the pointer was valid.
2. **Concurrent Access in `thermal_debug_tz_remove()`:** `thermal_debug_tz_remove()` could run in parallel with other functions accessing the thermal zone's `struct thermal_debugfs` object because it was not called under the thermal zone lock (`tz->lock`). This could lead to the function clearing `tz->debugfs` after another function has checked it, causing the `struct thermal_debugfs` to be freed prematurely while still being accessed by another process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The race condition could cause a NULL pointer dereference in `tze_seq_start()`.
*   **Use-After-Free:**  The concurrent access issue could lead to a use-after-free vulnerability when `thermal_debug_tz_remove()` frees the `struct thermal_debugfs` object prematurely.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Kernel Crash:** A NULL pointer dereference or a use-after-free could lead to a kernel crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **User Space Interaction:** The vulnerability can be triggered through user space interaction by opening the "mitigations" debugfs file in the first case and by removing a thermal zone in the second case.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the debugfs filesystem and have the capability to remove a thermal zone. This generally means the attacker must have some local privileges.

**Mitigation:**

The patch addresses the issues by:
1.  Passing a pointer to the `thermal_debugfs` structure to `debugfs_create_file()` instead of the thermal zone itself. The file operations functions retrieve the `thermal_debugfs` structure using `s->private` which is passed into `debugfs_create_file` and is guaranteed to be valid across file accesses until the file is removed.
2.  Using `tz->lock` in `thermal_debug_tz_remove()` around the check of  `tz->debugfs` and its reset to NULL, protecting the operations against concurrent access.
