  "description": "Meshtastic is an open source, off-grid, decentralized, mesh network. Meshtastic uses MQTT to communicate over an internet connection to a shared or private MQTT Server. Nodes can communicate directly via an internet connection or proxied through a connected phone (i.e., via bluetooth). Prior to version 2.5.1, multiple weaknesses in the MQTT implementation allow for authentication and **authorization bypass**es resulting in unauthorized control of MQTT-connected nodes. Version 2.5.1 contains a patch.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:** Multiple weaknesses in the Meshtastic MQTT implementation.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Authentication and authorization bypasses. The specific nature of these weaknesses is not described in the provided text.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   Unauthorized control of MQTT-connected nodes. This implies attackers can potentially manipulate, disrupt, or gain access to data on the affected devices.\n*   High impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\n**Attack Vectors:** Network-based attacks via MQTT. This means an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over a network.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not require any specific privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. The attack has a high complexity.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Affected Versions:** Meshtastic firmware versions prior to 2.5.1 are vulnerable.\n*   **Patched Versions:** Version 2.5.1 and later include the necessary fixes.\n*   **CVSS Score:** 8.1 (High). The CVSS vector string is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n\nThis provides more detail than the placeholder description in the CVE.",

Both CWE-306 and CWE-285 are Base level, providing specific classifications. CWE-306 is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), indicating a hierarchical relationship where missing authentication is a specific type of improper authentication.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n    class cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing authentication** (CWE-306), which allows an attacker to bypass identity verification. This leads to **improper authorization** (CWE-285), where the attacker gains unauthorized access to resources and functionality. The ultimate impact is **unauthorized control** of MQTT-connected nodes.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **missing authentication** (CWE-306) in the MQTT implementation, as it directly enables the subsequent authorization bypass. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the **authentication and authorization bypasses** result in **unauthorized control** of MQTT-connected nodes. This aligns with the description of CWE-306, where the product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity.\n\nThe retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-306, with a high relevance score across multiple keyphrases. The other CWEs were considered, but were deemed less relevant. For example, CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is a more general case of authentication failure, while CWE-306 specifically addresses the case where authentication is entirely missing. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) assumes that authorization checks are performed, but performed incorrectly, which is not the primary issue here. The absence of authentication is the critical flaw.\n\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is included as a secondary weakness because the **missing authentication** directly leads to the **authorization bypass**. The attacker can access resources without proper authorization checks due to the initial **lack of authentication**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause and the immediate consequence of the vulnerability. CWE-306 is a Base level CWE, as recommended by the mapping guidance.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n**CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function**\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n\n**CWE-285: Improper Authorization**\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.",
