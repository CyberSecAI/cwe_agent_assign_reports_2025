## Vulnerability Description
Execution with Unnecessary Privileges vulnerability in the Pager agent of multi-agent notification feature in Mitsubishi Electric Iconics Digital Solutions GENESIS64 prior to 10.97.3, Mitsubishi Electric GENESIS64 all versions and Mitsubishi Electric MC Works64 all versions allows a local authenticated attacker to make an unauthorized write to arbitrary files, by creating a symbolic link from a file used as a write destination by the services of the affected products to a target file. This could allow the attacker to destroy the file on a PC with the affected products installed, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the PC if the destroyed file is necessary for the operation of the PC.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| “Escalate to root/admin”                    | Privilege escalation impact           | Not CWE-269! Use root cause (e.g., 266, 250) |
| “Assigned wrong role/group”                 | Misassigned privilege                 | CWE-266                                      |
| “Runs as root” or “Should not run as admin” | Over-privileged execution             | CWE-250                                      |
| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
