# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-0753

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Axiomatic Bento4 up to 1.6.0. This vulnerability affects the function AP4_StdcFileByteStreamReadPartial of the component mp42aac. The manipulation leads to **heap-based buffer overflow**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap-based buffer overflow**
- **product:** Axiomatic Bento4
- **version:** up to 1.6.0
- **component:** mp42aac

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Root cause of vulnerability:
- **Bug 1:** Heap buffer overflow in `AP4_BitReader::ReadBits(unsigned int)` when processing mp4 files. The ASan output indicates a read of size 1 at an address 0 bytes to the right of a 56-byte allocated region.
- **Bug 2:** Heap buffer overflow in `fread` called from `AP4_StdcFileByteStream::ReadPartial`, likely due to insufficient bounds checking when reading data. The ASan output indicates a write of size 558 at an address 0 bytes to the right of a 1-byte allocated region.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Heap buffer overflow vulnerabilities in `mp42aac` component of Bento4.
- Insufficient bounds checking when reading data from streams.

Impact of exploitation:
- The provided content does not explicitly state the impact of exploitation, but heap buffer overflows can lead to crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.

Attack vectors:
- Crafted mp4 files (`seeds/input1` and `seeds/input2`) can trigger the vulnerabilities.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious mp4 file to a system using Bento4 to process it.

Mitigation or fix:
- The content does not provide a specific fix.

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description (as the CVE description is a placeholder).
