  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved pwm mediatek Prevent divide-by-zero in pwm_mediatek_config() With CONFIG_COMPILE_TEST && !CONFIG_HAVE_CLK, pwm_mediatek_config() has a divide-by-zero in the following line do_div(resolution, clk_get_rate(pc->clk_pwms[pwm->hwpwm])) due to the fact that the !CONFIG_HAVE_CLK version of clk_get_rate() returns zero. This is presumably just a theoretical problem COMPILE_TEST overrides the dependency on RALINK which would select COMMON_CLK. Regardless its a good idea to check for the error explicitly to avoid divide-by-zero. Fixes the following warning drivers/pwm/pwm-mediatek.o warning objtool .text unexpected end of section [ukleinek s/CONFIG_CLK/CONFIG_HAVE_CLK/]",
