The `$_FILES` input is directly used to determine the storage location of the uploaded file without any verification or cleaning.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Unrestricted file upload vulnerability.\n- Lack of input validation and sanitization on file upload handling.\n- Direct use of user-controlled input (`$_FILES`) to determine file storage location.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- File overwrite.\n- File injection.\n- Directory traversal attacks.\n- Denial of service (DoS) attacks.\n- Potential remote code execution (RCE).\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Malicious file upload through the vulnerable `manage_website.php` file.\n- Attacker can control the file name and potentially the file path due to lack of sanitization.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to access the file upload functionality of the `manage_website.php` file. This may require some level of authentication or network access depending on the application.\n- The attacker does not need specific privileges, only access to the upload feature.",

The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **unrestricted upload**, and the analysis of the CVE reference links confirms the lack of input validation as the root cause, leading to this vulnerability. |\n| CWE-184 | Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The uploaded file type is not checked against a comprehensive list of disallowed/dangerous file types. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-434, which is a base-level CWE.
