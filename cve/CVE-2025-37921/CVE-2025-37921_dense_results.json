  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved vxlan vnifilter Fix unlocked deletion of default FDB entry When a VNI is deleted from a VXLAN device in vnifilter mode, the FDB entry associated with the default remote (assuming one was configured) is deleted without holding the hash lock. This is wrong and will result in a warning [1] being generated by the lockdep annotation that was added by commit ebe642067455 (vxlan Create wrappers for FDB lookup). Reproducer # ip link add vx0 up type vxlan dstport 4789 external vnifilter local 192.0.2.1 # bridge vni add vni 10010 remote 198.51.100.1 dev vx0 # bridge vni del vni 10010 dev vx0 Fix by acquiring the hash lock before the deletion and releasing it afterwards. Blame the original commit that introduced the issue rather than the one that exposed it.
