# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-4905

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in iop-apl-uw basestation3 up to 3.0.4 and classified as problematic. This issue affects the function load_qc_pickl of the file basestation3/QC.py. The manipulation of the argument qc_file leads to deserialization. An attack has to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The code maintainer tagged the issue as closed. But there is no new commit nor release in the GitHub repository available so far.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** basestation3/QC.py
- **vector:** manipulation of qc_file argument
- **weakness:** **['improper deserialization', 'deserialization']**
- **product:** iop-apl-uw basestation3
- **version:** up to 3.0.4

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## CVE-2025-4905 Analysis

The provided content details a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the `basestation3` project, specifically within the `QC.py` file. This vulnerability is due to insecure deserialization using Python's `pickle.load()` function.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `load_qc_pickl()` function in `QC.py` uses `pickle.load()` to deserialize data from a file without any validation or sanitization of the input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** Using `pickle.load()` on untrusted data allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not validate or sanitize the data being deserialized.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system.
*   **Remote system compromise:** If the attacker can control the `qc_file`, they can compromise the entire system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker can supply a malicious pickle file (`qc.pkl`) that, when loaded by `load_qc_pickl()`, will execute arbitrary code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control the `qc_file` that is passed to the `load_qc_pickl()` function. This could involve uploading a malicious file or manipulating an existing file.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Avoid using pickle for loading untrusted data.**
*   **Use safe alternatives:**  Employ safer serialization formats like `json.load()` or a custom binary format with robust input validation.
