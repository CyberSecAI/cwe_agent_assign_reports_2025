  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved x86 fix user address masking **non-canonical speculation issue** It turns out that AMD has a Meltdown Lite(tm) issue with non-canonical accesses in kernel space. And so using just the high bit to decide whether an access is in user space or kernel space ends up with the good old leak speculative data if you have the right gadget using the result CVE-2020-12965 Transient Execution of Non-Canonical Accesses Now, the kernel surrounds the access with a STAC/CLAC pair, and those instructions end up serializing execution on older Zen architectures, which closes the speculation window. But that was true only up until Zen 5, which renames the AC bit [1]. That improves performance of STAC/CLAC a lot, but also means that the speculation window is now open. Note that this affects not just the new address masking, but also the regular valid_user_address() check used by access_ok(), and the asm version of the sign bit check in the get_user() helpers. It does not affect put_user() or clear_user() variants, since theres no speculative result to be used in a gadget for those operations.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content is related to a vulnerability fix in the Linux kernel concerning speculative execution and user address masking, which aligns with the described issue for CVE-2024-50102, which is a placeholder for a CVE description retrieval.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant information:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from the way the kernel distinguishes between user-space and kernel-space addresses, particularly when using address masking and checks like `valid_user_address()`, `access_ok()`, and `get_user()`.\n*   On AMD CPUs, especially prior to Zen 5, the kernel used a STAC/CLAC pair to serialize execution and prevent speculative execution leaks when accessing memory.\n*   Zen 5 renamed the AC bit, which significantly improves STAC/CLAC performance but also reopens the speculation window.\n*   Using just the high bit to determine user/kernel space allowed for speculative data leakage via gadgets.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Speculative Execution Vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is that the kernel\u2019s previous methods for checking user addresses were vulnerable to speculative execution attacks. This meant that a malicious user-space program could potentially leak kernel data by carefully crafting a gadget that exploits the speculative execution window.\n*   **Inadequate Address Masking:** The initial address masking implementation using only the sign bit was insufficient.\n*   **Vulnerable Functions:** `valid_user_address()`, `access_ok()`, and the assembly version of sign bit checks in `get_user()` were vulnerable. `put_user()` and `clear_user()` are not affected.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Information Leakage:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker in user space to leak sensitive kernel data by crafting a suitable gadget for speculation.\n*   The vulnerability allows for \"Meltdown Lite(tm)\"-like attacks.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Speculative Execution Gadgets:** The attack relies on a malicious user-space program crafting a gadget that exploits the speculative execution of memory access checks using `valid_user_address`, `access_ok()` or `get_user()`.\n*   The attack exploits the speculation window opened due to changes in how STAC/CLAC operates on Zen 5 CPUs and later.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **User-space access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code in user space.\n*   **Knowledge of speculative execution:**  The attacker needs to craft a gadget to exploit the speculative execution behavior of the affected functions.\n*   **Target System:** The target system must have an affected AMD CPU, especially those of Zen 5 architecture or later.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The fix involves replacing the previous sign-bit based check with a comparison against a `USER_PTR_MAX` value, which is initialized at runtime.\n*   The fix also updates the `mask_user_address` function to use a comparison instead of a sign extension.\n\nThis commit addresses the vulnerability by correcting the address masking logic and the related checks, preventing speculative data leaks.",

The **non-canonical speculation issue** may also manifest as an observable discrepancy. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the decision is the direct match between the vulnerability description and CWE-1342, which details information exposure via **transient execution** due to microarchitectural state issues. CWE-203 is considered a secondary candidate due to the potential for observable timing differences as a result of the **speculative execution**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1342[\"CWE-1342: Information Exposure through Microarchitectural State after Transient Execution\"]\n    cwe203[\"CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1342 primary\n    class cwe203 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with a **non-canonical speculation issue** that leads to **speculative execution**, ultimately resulting in information leakage. The root cause is the insufficient validation of user addresses, compounded by changes in CPU architecture affecting STAC/CLAC instruction behavior.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the vulnerability description's emphasis on **speculative execution** and its consequences, with the key phrase \"**non-canonical speculation issue**\" pointing directly to issues related to microarchitectural state and **transient execution**. The description states that \"using just the high bit to decide whether an access is in user space or kernel space ends up with the good old leak speculative data if you have the right gadget using the result\". This aligns precisely with CWE-1342's focus on information exposure through **transient execution**.\n\nThe retriever results strongly support CWE-1342, assigning it the highest score. The evidence provided in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the architecture-specific nature of the vulnerability and its connection to **speculative execution**.\n\nCWE-1342 is selected because it operates at the Base level of abstraction and directly addresses the **rootcause** described in the vulnerability.
