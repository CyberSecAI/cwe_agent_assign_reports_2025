# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-47770

## Vulnerability Description
Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. It is capable of protecting workloads across on-premises, virtualized, containerized, and cloud-based environments. This vulnerability occurs when the system has **weak privilege access**, that allows an attacker to do privilege escalation. In this case the attacker is able to view agent list on Wazuh dashboard with no privilege access. This issue has been addressed in release version 4.9.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **weak privilege access**
- **impact:** privilege escalation
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Wazuh

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2024-47770 based on provided content:

This content **IS RELATED** to CVE-2024-47770. It provides more detail than the official CVE description (which was a placeholder).

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

Weak privilege access control in the Wazuh dashboard allows an attacker to view the agent list without the necessary permissions (e.g., `admin`, `kibanauser`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Insufficient access control.
*   Privilege escalation – ability to access information normally restricted to privileged users.
*   CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management

**Impact of exploitation:**

Unauthorized access to agent list information, including IDs, names, IPs, groups, OS details, and last keep-alive status.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Network-based attack.
*   An attacker with a low-privileged account can send a specific POST request to `/api/request` with a crafted JSON body to retrieve the agent list.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs a low-privileged account on the Wazuh dashboard.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the Wazuh dashboard.
*   The attacker needs to know the correct request headers and JSON body format.
*   The attacker needs to have a valid cookie for authentication.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Upgrade to Wazuh dashboard version 4.9.1 or later.
*   Ensure proper role-based access control is enforced for accessing sensitive information like the agent list.

**CVSS v3 base metrics:**

*   Attack Vector: Network (N)
*   Attack Complexity: Low (L)
*   Privileges Required: Low (L)
*   User Interaction: Required (R)
*   Scope: Unchanged (U)
*   Confidentiality: Low (L)
*   Integrity: Low (L)
*   Availability: None (N)

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| “Escalate to root/admin”                    | Privilege escalation impact           | Not CWE-269! Use root cause (e.g., 266, 250) |
| “Assigned wrong role/group”                 | Misassigned privilege                 | CWE-266                                      |
| “Runs as root” or “Should not run as admin” | Over-privileged execution             | CWE-250                                      |
| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
