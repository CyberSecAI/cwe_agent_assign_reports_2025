This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Trimble SketchUp Viewer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of SKP files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24104.",

CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is also relevant as it represents the root cause that allows the out-of-bounds read to occur. While other CWEs like CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) were considered, the description explicitly mentions a read, making CWE-125 a more precise match. CWE-125 and CWE-787 are peer CWEs and can be reached from CWE-119. CWE-20 is a more general class of weakness that can lead to various vulnerabilities, including out-of-bounds reads. The abstraction levels are appropriate, with CWE-125 at the Base level and CWE-20 at the Class level, reflecting different levels of specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe125\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20), which leads to an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125). The **out-of-bounds read** allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.\n- CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation): Root cause\n- CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read): Direct consequence of the root cause\n- Arbitrary code execution: Impact of the vulnerability\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the supplementary information from the CVE reference links. The primary weakness is clearly identified as an **out-of-bounds read** due to a **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**.\n\nThe relationship graph shows that CWE-125 is a specific type of buffer error, and the retriever results confirm this as a strong candidate. The mapping guidance for CWE-125 allows its usage at the Base level of abstraction.\n\nCWE-20 is included because the description explicitly states that the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** is the root cause. While CWE-20 is a Class, it accurately represents the underlying issue that leads to the out-of-bounds read.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-125 directly addressing the read and CWE-20 identifying the cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* The vulnerability description doesn't mention anything about uninitialized pointers.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Selected:* This matches the **weakness** stated in the description.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.

While other CWEs like CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) were considered, the description explicitly mentions a read, making CWE-125 a more precise match. CWE-125 and CWE-787 are peer CWEs and can be reached from CWE-119. CWE-20 is a more general class of weakness that can lead to various vulnerabilities, including out-of-bounds reads. The abstraction levels are appropriate, with CWE-125 at the Base level and CWE-20 at the Class level, reflecting different levels of specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe125\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20), which leads to an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125). The **out-of-bounds read** allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.\n- CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation): Root cause\n- CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read): Direct consequence of the root cause\n- Arbitrary code execution: Impact of the vulnerability\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the supplementary information from the CVE reference links. The primary weakness is clearly identified as an **out-of-bounds read** due to a **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**.\n\nThe relationship graph shows that CWE-125 is a specific type of buffer error, and the retriever results confirm this as a strong candidate. The mapping guidance for CWE-125 allows its usage at the Base level of abstraction.\n\nCWE-20 is included because the description explicitly states that the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** is the root cause. While CWE-20 is a Class, it accurately represents the underlying issue that leads to the out-of-bounds read.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-125 directly addressing the read and CWE-20 identifying the cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* The vulnerability description doesn't mention anything about uninitialized pointers.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Selected:* This matches the **weakness** stated in the description.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
