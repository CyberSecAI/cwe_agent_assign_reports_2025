  "description": "zot is a production-ready vendor-neutral OCI image registry. The group data stored for users in the boltdb database (meta.db) is an append-list so **group revocations/removals are ignored in the API**. **SetUserGroups is alled on login, but instead of replacing the group memberships, they are appended**. This may be due to some conflict with the group definitions in the config file, but that wasnt obvious to me if it were the case. Any Zot configuration that relies on group-based authorization will not respect group remove/revocation by an IdP. This issue has been addressed in version 2.1.2. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

Verification:**\n\nThe content directly relates to CVE-2025-23208 as it explicitly states the CVE ID and provides a detailed description of the vulnerability.\n\n**2. Extracted Information:**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The group data stored for users in the boltdb database is an append-list, meaning group revocations/removals are ignored.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect implementation of group membership updates in the boltdb database. Instead of replacing group memberships, they are appended.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Zot configurations relying on group-based authorization will not respect group remove/revocation by an IdP, potentially granting unauthorized access.\n*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker can exploit this by removing a user from a group in the IdP, but still gaining access to resources due to the outdated group information stored in Zot.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to manage group memberships in the Identity Provider (IdP) connected to Zot. No specific privileges within Zot itself are required to trigger the vulnerability.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** The vulnerability was patched in version 2.1.2. The fix involves replacing the append operation with a proper replacement of group memberships in the `SetUserGroups` function (in both `boltdb.go` and `dynamodb.go`).\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.3 (High)\n*   **Affected versions:** <=2.1.1\n*   **Patched versions:** 2.1.2\n\n**3. Additional Details:**\n\nThe content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description. It includes:\n\n*   Specific file and line numbers where the vulnerability exists (`pkg/meta/boltdb/boltdb.go#L1665` and `pkg/meta/dynamodb/dynamodb.go#L1650`).\n*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability.\n*   CVSS vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L\n*   Credit to the reporter, jeff-mccoy.",

  "analysis": "# Summary\n| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE. The application performs an authorization check, but it does so incorrectly by appending instead of replacing group memberships.|\n| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary. There may be an authentication issue if group membership is not verified correctly upon login. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was that between CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and its parent, CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), and its children. CWE-863 was chosen because the vulnerability explicitly involves an authorization check that is performed incorrectly. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was considered a secondary candidate because the **incorrect** group membership update could be interpreted as a missing authentication step. The abstraction levels were considered to select the most specific CWE, favoring Base and Variant levels over Class and Pillar when the evidence supported it.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe306 -->|PEEROF| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect implementation of group membership updates** (the **weakness**) in the boltdb database, where group memberships are appended instead of replaced. This leads to group revocations being ignored, and finally, results in unauthorized access to resources that rely on group-based authorization (the **impact**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the provided evidence, indicates that the primary weakness lies in the **incorrect authorization** mechanism. The key phrase \"**group revocations/removals are ignored in the API**\" directly points to an authorization issue where the system fails to properly enforce group-based access control. The `SetUserGroups` function **appending** group memberships instead of replacing them further strengthens this conclusion.\n\nThe retriever results, particularly the high scores for CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), support this assessment. CWE-863 is more specific and accurately describes the **incorrect** authorization check, making it the preferred choice over the more general CWE-285. The MITRE guidance on Authentication vs Authorization was helpful in distinguishing between authentication and authorization failures. In this case, the issue occurs after authentication, during the authorization process, which further justifies the selection of CWE-863.\n\nThe selection of CWE-863 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability which is the incorrect implementation of the authorization check. The evidence from the vulnerability description is strong and supports this classification with high confidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
