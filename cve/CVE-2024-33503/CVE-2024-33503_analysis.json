However, upon further analysis, and leveraging the provided CWE guidance differentiating privileges and permissions, CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) emerges as a more precise classification. The CVE reference summary explicitly states \"Improper privilege management due to incorrect filesystem permissions.\" This is the root cause. The \"**improper privilege management**\" is not simply a mismanagement of privileges but a specific error in how privileges are assigned. This aligns perfectly with CWE-266.\n\nCWE-250 was considered because the elevated privileges might be unnecessary for the commands being executed, but the primary issue is the incorrect assignment, not the unnecessary execution with those privileges. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was considered but ultimately deemed less relevant as the core problem is not a flawed authorization check, but rather the initial misassignment of privileges that bypasses the authorization process altogether.\n\nThe selection of CWE-266 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause identified in the CVE description and supported by \"**improper privilege management** due to incorrect filesystem permissions.\" The CWE guidance underscores that when a specific privilege assignment error is evident, CWE-266 is more appropriate than the more general CWE-269.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
