The vulnerability description indicates a general **improper access control** issue without specifying whether it stems from a missing authentication, missing authorization, or incorrect authorization. Therefore, the higher-level CWE-284 is more appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control** (CWE-284), which leads to the exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **improper access control** as the root cause, leading to the exposure of sensitive information. The retriever results suggested several CWEs related to authorization and access control. However, the provided description lacks the specificity to pinpoint the exact type of access control failure (missing authentication, missing authorization, or incorrect authorization). Thus, CWE-284, a more general category for **improper access control**, is the most appropriate primary mapping.\n\nThe decision is primarily based on the vulnerability description's key phrase \"**improper access control**\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which explicitly states \"**Root Cause: Improper access control in `KnoxService`**\".\n\nCWE-284 is at the Pillar level, but more specific CWEs (Base, Variant) require more information about the type of access control failure. Without that information, choosing a more specific CWE would be speculative.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE Classification Guidance\n\nThe following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:\n\n### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance\n\n## ===Guidance===\n\n### Level Set \u2013 Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control\n\n**Authentication**:\nDetermines *who* the actor is (identity validation).
