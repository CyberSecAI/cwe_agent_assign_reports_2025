CWE-256 is a specific type of CWE-312, and given the vulnerability description explicitly mentions passwords being stored in plaintext, CWE-256 is the more appropriate choice.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of Passwords\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe312\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe312 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward: the **root cause** is the **plaintext storage of credentials (CWE-256)**, which leads to the impact of **unauthorized access to credentials in plaintext**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **credential exposure vulnerability** as the primary issue. After reviewing the retriever results and complete CWE specifications, CWE-256 Plaintext Storage of Passwords was selected as the primary CWE due to the explicit mention of passwords being stored in plaintext. CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information was considered as a secondary candidate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-256 is based on the vulnerability description: \"A **credential exposure vulnerability** in Electrolink 500W, 1kW, 2kW Medium DAB Transmitter Web v01.09, v01.08, v01.07, and Display v1.4, v1.2 allows unauthorized attackers to access credentials in plaintext.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the parent-child relationship between CWE-256 and CWE-312, which helped to refine the classification to the most specific applicable CWE.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-256 directly addresses the specific vulnerability of passwords being stored in plaintext, while CWE-312 is a more general category of sensitive information being stored in cleartext.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a
