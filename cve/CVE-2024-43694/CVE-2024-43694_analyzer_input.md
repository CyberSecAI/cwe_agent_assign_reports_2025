# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-43694

## Vulnerability Description
In the goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin application, the encryption keys are stored along with a static IV on the device. This allows for complete decryption of keys stored on the device. This allows an attacker to decrypt all encrypted broadcast communications based on broadcast keys stored on the device.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **encryption keys stored along with a static IV**
- **impact:** complete decryption of keys stored on the device
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-43694:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information: Encryption keys and a static Initialization Vector (IV) are stored on the End User Device (EUD).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The encryption keys are stored along with a static IV on the End User Device (EUD).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with physical access to the EUD can decrypt the stored encryption keys.
- This allows the attacker to decrypt all encrypted broadcast communications based on those keys.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Physical access to the End User Device (EUD) is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs physical access and control of the EUD.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory recommends using strong access control measures and layered encryption on the EUD as mitigation strategies.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 4.3 (AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) and a CVSS v4 base score of 5.1 (CVSS4.0/AV:P/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).
- This vulnerability is present in goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin versions 1.9.12 and prior.
- It is recommended to update to version 2.0.7 or greater to address the issue.
