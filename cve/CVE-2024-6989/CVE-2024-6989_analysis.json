The vulnerability is a Use-After-Free. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-416, which is a variant of a more general class of memory management errors. While there are other CWEs related to race conditions and memory corruption, the description explicitly mentions \"use after free,\" making CWE-416 the most accurate choice. There are no parent-child relationships or chain patterns that strongly influence the mapping beyond the direct identification of the weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe416 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **use after free** (**rootcause**) which leads to potential heap corruption.\n  - Root Cause: CWE-416 Use After Free\n  - Impact: Heap corruption\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states \"Use after free in Loader\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the root cause as \"Use after free in Loader\". The primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions is CWE-416. The retriever results also list CWE-416 as the top result.
