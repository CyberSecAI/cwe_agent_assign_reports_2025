### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** PHPGurukul Complaint Management system
- **version:** 1
- **component:** /admin/index.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the 'Complaint Management system' version 1.0, specifically in the `/admin/index.php` file.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `username` parameter within the `/admin/index.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code via this parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly uses user-supplied input in SQL queries without proper sanitization or prepared statements, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access
- Sensitive data leakage
- Data tampering
- Comprehensive system control
- Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited via a POST request to `/admin/index.php` by manipulating the `username` parameter.
- No authentication or login is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable `/admin/index.php` endpoint.
- No prior authentication or specific position within the network is required.

**Additional details:**
- The provided content gives specific SQL injection payloads that can be used to exploit this vulnerability using sqlmap.
- It also provides guidance on how to fix the vulnerability, including using prepared statements and parameter binding, input validation and filtering, minimizing database user permissions, and conducting regular security audits.
