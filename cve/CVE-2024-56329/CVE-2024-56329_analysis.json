  "description": "Socialstream is a third-party package for Laravel Jetstream. It replaces the published authentication and profile scaffolding provided by Laravel Jetstream, with scaffolding that has support for Laravel Socialite. When linking a social account to an already authenticated user, the lack of a confirmation step introduces a security risk. This is exacerbated if ->stateless() is used in the Socialite configuration, bypassing state verification and making the exploit easier. Developers should ensure that users explicitly confirm account linking and avoid configurations that skip critical security checks. Socialstream v6.2 introduces a new custom route that requires a user to Confirm or Deny a request to link a social account. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a lack of confirmation when linking a social account to an already authenticated user. Specifically, the absence of a confirmation step before linking the accounts creates a security risk. This is worsened when the `->stateless()` method is used in Socialite configuration, as it bypasses state verification.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Missing Confirmation Step:** The primary weakness is the absence of explicit user confirmation before linking a social account to an existing user account.\n- **Bypassed State Verification:** Using `->stateless()` in Socialite configuration bypasses important security checks, making exploitation easier.\n- **Lack of Authorization Check**: The application does not verify if the user intended to link a social account.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Account Hijacking**: An attacker can potentially link their social account to a victim's authenticated account without their explicit consent, effectively hijacking the victim's account.\n- **Unauthorized Access**: By linking their social account, the attacker gains access to the victim's resources and potentially sensitive information within the application.\n- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**: The impact metrics of this vulnerability are high in all three areas, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the affected system.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network:** The attack vector is through the network, which means that the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.\n- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires active user interaction. A user must be logged into their account and tricked into initiating a social login flow from a malicious link.\n- **Social Engineering:** An attacker might trick a user to initiate the social login flow through a crafted malicious link by exploiting the lack of a confirmation prompt.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application.\n- **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to trick the user into initiating the social login flow.\n- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker doesn't need any pre-existing privileges on the system.\n- **Knowledge of the application**: The attacker needs to be aware of the application\u2019s use of social logins and the vulnerable endpoint.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\nThe provided commit `ae4dc3906f54fa792b296036d7b3dcea9a4d259b` addresses the vulnerability by:\n- Introducing a new custom route that requires a user to \"Confirm\" or \"Deny\" a request to link a social account.\n- Adding a confirmation prompt page (`resources/views/oauth/prompt.blade.php`).\n- Updating `src/Actions/AuthenticateOAuthCallback.php` to redirect users to the confirmation prompt when logged in.\n- Adding logic in `src/Http/Controllers/OAuthController.php` to handle the confirmation and denial of account linking requests.\n\nThe CVE identifier `CVE-2024-56329` is correctly associated with this vulnerability. The fix introduces a confirmation step before linking social accounts to authenticated users, mitigating the described attack vector. The CVSS v4 score is `CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H`",

The **lack of confirmation** step during social account linking points to a failure to properly authenticate the user's intent to link accounts, leading to CWE-306. However, since the user is already authenticated to the main application, the **lack of authorization** to link the social account is also relevant, suggesting CWE-862 as a secondary concern. The bypass of state verification through `->stateless()` exacerbates the issue. CWE-352 is considered as a further potential consequence due to the bypass of state verification which is normally present to prevent CSRF.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    \n    cwe352 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe306\n    cwe862 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe306\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe862,cwe352 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of a confirmation step** (CWE-306), progresses to potential **unauthorized account linking** due to **missing authorization** (CWE-862), and can be further exploited due to the **bypassed state verification** which can lead to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CWE-352).\n  - Root Cause: **Lack of Confirmation Step** for account linking (CWE-306)\n  - Weakness: **Missing Authorization** to verify the user's intent to link accounts (CWE-862)\n  - Exploitation Easier: Bypass state verification\n  - Impact: Unauthorized account linking, potential account hijacking, actions performed as the victim.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **lack of confirmation** during social account linking as the primary issue. The retriever results suggested CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication). However, after considering the guidance on Authentication vs. Authorization, CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was deemed a more accurate representation of the root cause because there's no check to confirm the user's intention to link accounts. CWE-862 is also relevant since after the initial authentication to the application, there is no authorization check to link the social account. Finally, CWE-352 (CSRF) is also considered as the bypass of state verification makes exploitation easier.\n\nThe decision to prioritize CWE-306 was based on the evidence that the application **does not perform any authentication** for the critical function of linking social accounts. This aligns with the CWE's description and usage guidelines. The abstraction level of Base is also appropriate as it directly represents the **missing authentication** check.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Used:* While Weak Authentication (CWE-1390) was considered, the vulnerability isn't about a weakness in the existing authentication mechanism, but rather the **lack of authentication** for a specific function (linking social accounts).\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key (CWE-639) is not a good fit because the vulnerability doesn't involve modifying a key value to bypass authorization.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter (CWE-472) doesn't apply because the issue isn't about controlling parameters assumed to be immutable.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*Not Used:* Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection') (CWE-74) is irrelevant as there's no indication of injection vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer (CWE-212) is not applicable as the vulnerability doesn't relate to sensitive information exposure.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm (CWE-303) is not the correct CWE, as the problem isn't with the implementation of an authentication algorithm, but with the **lack of authentication** for a specific function.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Used:* Use of Weak Credentials (CWE-1391) is not applicable as there is no mention of weak credentials in the description.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control
