An attacker could craft a malicious model that uses Pickle to pull in a malicious PyPI package (hosted, for example, on pypi.org or GitHub) via `pip.main()`.

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-1716 based on provided content:\n\nThe provided content details a vulnerability in `picklescan` (versions <= 0.0.21) that allows bypassing security checks during deserialization of pickle files. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from `picklescan` not treating `pip` as an unsafe global. This allows an attacker to leverage `pip.main()` within a malicious pickle file to install a malicious PyPI package during deserialization.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Unsafe deserialization:** Python's `pickle` module allows arbitrary code execution via the `reduce` method.\n*   **Insufficient input validation:** `picklescan` fails to identify `pip.main()` as a potentially dangerous operation.\n*   **CWE-184:** Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution on the system deserializing the malicious pickle file.\n*   **Supply Chain Attack:** Attackers can distribute malicious pickle files through various channels (ML models, APIs, saved Python objects).\n*   **Bypassing Security Tools:** The attack bypasses `picklescan` and potentially other similar security tools.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker crafts a malicious pickle file that, when deserialized, calls `pip.main()` to install a malicious package from a source like PyPI or GitHub.\n*   The malicious package's `setup.py`, entry points, or post-install hooks execute arbitrary code.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious pickle file to a system that will deserialize it.\n*   The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious PyPI package or a malicious package on a platform like GitHub.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Add `\"pip\": \"*\"` to the list of unsafe globals in `picklescan`.\n*   Upgrade to `picklescan` version 0.0.22 or higher, which includes this fix and additional restricted globals.\n\n**Additional Details (more than CVE description):**\n\n*   **Proof-of-Concept (PoC):** The content provides a detailed PoC, including example code for creating a malicious `setup.py` and a malicious pickle file.\n*   **CVSS Score:** The CVSS score is provided as 5.3 (Moderate severity).\n*   **CVSS v4 Metrics:** Detailed CVSS v4 metrics are provided.\n*   **Credits:** Trevor Madge (@madgetr) of Sonatype is credited with discovering the vulnerability.\n*   **EPSS Score:** 0.22% (45th percentile)\n*   **Affected Versions:** <= 0.0.21, Patched versions: 0.0.22",
