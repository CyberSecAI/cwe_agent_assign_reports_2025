# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-39340
## Query
The authentication system of Securepoint UTM mishandles OTP keys. This allows the bypassing of second-factor verification (when OTP is enabled) in both the administration web interface and the user portal. Affected versions include UTM 11.5 through 12.6.4 and Reseller Preview 12.7.0. The issue has been fixed in UTM 12.6.5 and 12.7.1.
