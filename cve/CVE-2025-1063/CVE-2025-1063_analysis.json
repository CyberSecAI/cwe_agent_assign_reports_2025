While CWE-200 was initially considered due to the **sensitive information exposure**, CWE-359 was chosen as a more specific representation of the vulnerability, fitting the description of exposing private, personal information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe359 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe306\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe359 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** for the function responsible for exporting taxonomy settings. This **lack of authentication** allows unauthenticated attackers to access the function and extract sensitive data such as API keys and tokens, resulting in **sensitive information exposure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed towards CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) due to the **sensitive information exposure**. However, further review and relationship analysis indicated that CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability, as it involves the exposure of private personal information. The **missing authentication** aspect is captured by CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function), indicating a potential vulnerability chain.\n\nThe decision to use CWE-359 is based on the vulnerability description stating that \"unauthenticated attackers extract sensitive data including API keys and tokens\", which aligns with the definition of CWE-359 as exposing private, personal information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery
