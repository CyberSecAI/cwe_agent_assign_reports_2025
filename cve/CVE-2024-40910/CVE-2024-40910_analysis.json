  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ax25 Fix **refcount imbalance** on inbound connections When releasing a socket in ax25_release(), we call netdev_put() to decrease the refcount on the associated ax.25 device. However, the execution path for accepting an incoming connection never calls netdev_hold(). This imbalance leads to refcount errors, and ultimately to kernel crashes. A typical call trace for the above situation will start with one of the following errors refcount_t decrement hit 0 leaking memory. refcount_t underflow use-after-free. And will then have a trace like Call Trace ? show_regs+0x64/0x70 ? __warn+0x83/0x120 ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xb2/0x100 ? report_bug+0x158/0x190 ? prb_read_valid+0x20/0x30 ? handle_bug+0x3e/0x70 ? exc_invalid_op+0x1c/0x70 ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1f/0x30 ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xb2/0x100 ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xb2/0x100 ax25_release+0x2ad/0x360 __sock_release+0x35/0xa0 sock_close+0x19/0x20 [...] On reboot (or any attempt to remove the interface), the kernel gets stuck in an infinite loop unregister_netdevice waiting for ax0 to become free. Usage count = 0 This patch corrects these issues by ensuring that we call netdev_hold() and ax25_dev_hold() for new connections in ax25_accept(). This makes the logic leading to ax25_accept() match the logic for ax25_bind() in both cases we increment the refcount, which",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe root cause of the vulnerability is a refcount imbalance in the ax25 networking module of the Linux kernel. When a socket is released in `ax25_release()`, `netdev_put()` is called to decrement the reference count on the associated ax.25 device. However, the code path for accepting incoming connections in `ax25_accept()` was missing a corresponding call to `netdev_hold()` to increment the reference count. This discrepancy leads to a refcount imbalance.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Refcount Imbalance:** The primary vulnerability is a missing reference count increment when accepting incoming ax25 connections, specifically on the network device.\n- **Use-after-free:**  The refcount imbalance can lead to a use-after-free condition when the network device's refcount drops to zero prematurely.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Kernel Crash:** The refcount errors can lead to kernel crashes, with messages like \"refcount_t: decrement hit 0; leaking memory.\" or \"refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.\"\n- **Infinite Loop on Interface Removal:** When trying to remove or unregister the network interface, the kernel may get stuck in an infinite loop, unable to proceed.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Inbound Connections:** The vulnerability is triggered by accepting incoming ax25 connections.\n- **Triggering Socket Release:** Closing a socket after accepting an incoming connection triggers the vulnerability.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- An attacker needs to be able to send ax25 connection requests to a vulnerable system.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The fix ensures that `netdev_hold()` and `ax25_dev_hold()` are called in `ax25_accept()` for new connections, matching the logic of `ax25_bind()`. This ensures that reference counts are appropriately managed and decremented in `ax25_release()`.\n- The provided information includes multiple commits that resolve the same issue. This highlights the vulnerability's severity.\n- The vulnerability was present in the Linux kernel's ax25 networking implementation, specifically in the `af_ax25.c` file.\n- The issue is resolved by adding 2 calls: `netdev_hold(ax25_dev->dev, &ax25->dev_tracker, GFP_ATOMIC);` and `ax25_dev_hold(ax25_dev);` in `ax25_accept()`.",

The vulnerability description clearly states a \"**refcount imbalance**\". Due to the **refcount imbalance**, a Use-After-Free condition (CWE-416) can occur, as the resource might be freed prematurely. A Double Free (CWE-415) could also arise from improper refcount management, as could a Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime (CWE-401). These are all variants and thus more specific than their parents.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe911[\"CWE-911: Improper Update of Reference Count\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe415[\"CWE-415: Double Free\"]\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe666[\"CWE-666: Operation on Resource in Wrong Phase of Lifecycle\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Dead Code\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe666\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe415 -->|CHILDOF| cwe666\n    cwe415 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe401 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe400 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe911 primary\n    class cwe416,cwe415,cwe401 secondary\n    class cwe666,cwe672,cwe400,cwe770 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **refcount imbalance** (CWE-911) caused by the missing `netdev_hold()` call. This can lead to a premature freeing of the network device, resulting in a use-after-free condition (CWE-416) or a double free (CWE-415), and possibly a memory leak (CWE-401). The ultimate impact is a kernel crash or an infinite loop.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **refcount imbalance** (CWE-911). The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" clearly states: \"The root cause of the vulnerability is a refcount imbalance in the ax25 networking module of the Linux kernel... This discrepancy leads to a refcount imbalance.\" The fix involves ensuring that `netdev_hold()` is called, which directly addresses the **refcount imbalance**. The retriever results also pointed to CWE-911 as a strong candidate.\n\nCWE-416 (Use After Free) is a potential consequence of the **refcount imbalance**, as noted in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\": \"The refcount imbalance can lead to a use-after-free condition when the network device's refcount drops to zero prematurely.\" Similarly, CWE-415 (Double Free) and CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) are possible outcomes, though less directly stated.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-911 directly addresses the root cause. While use-after-free, double-free, and memory leak are possible consequences of incorrect reference counting, these are impacts, not the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
