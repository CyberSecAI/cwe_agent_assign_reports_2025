### 2. CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input (Score: 224.37)

The product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax....

### 3. CWE-20: Improper Input Validation (Score: 222.04)

The product receives input or data, but it does
        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the
        properties that are required to process the data safely and
        correctly....

### 4. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 208.93)
