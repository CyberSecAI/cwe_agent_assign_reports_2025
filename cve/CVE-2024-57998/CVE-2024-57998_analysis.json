  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved OPP add index check to assert to avoid **buffer overflow** in _read_freq() Pass the freq index to the assert function to make sure we do not read a freq out of the opp->rates[] table when called from the indexed variants dev_pm_opp_find_freq_exact_indexed() or dev_pm_opp_find_freq_ceil/floor_indexed(). Add a secondary parameter to the assert function, unused for assert_single_clk() then add assert_clk_index() which will check for the clock index when called from the _indexed() find functions.",

CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) and CWE-129 (Improper Validation of Array Index) are both children of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). The description indicates that the vulnerability involves reading data past the end of a buffer, which aligns with CWE-125. Furthermore, the added index check to prevent the **buffer overflow** suggests a problem with array index validation which aligns with CWE-129. Selecting CWE-125 and CWE-129 provides a more specific and accurate representation of the weakness than the more general CWE-119.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe129[\"CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\"]\n    \n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe129 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe129 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a potential **improper** or **missing** index validation, leading to an out-of-bounds read in the `_read_freq()` function.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is identified as CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) because the core issue revolves around reading data beyond the intended buffer limits. The vulnerability description states that a **buffer overflow** could occur in the `_read_freq()` function if an out-of-bounds read happens. The added index check to the assert function confirms this. While CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a broader category, CWE-125 specifically addresses the read operation. CWE-129 (Improper Validation of Array Index) is included as a secondary candidate because the fix involves adding index checks, suggesting that the root cause might stem from **improper** validation of array indices. The choice of CWE-125 is supported by the retriever results, which lists it as a potentially relevant CWE. The evidence from the description directly supports this classification, as it mentions the possibility of reading a frequency out of the `opp->rates[]` table.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-119: While this is a parent of CWE-125 and listed as the top combined result by the retriever, it is too general. The vulnerability is specifically about reading out of bounds.\n*   CWE-190 and CWE-191: These relate to integer overflow and underflow, but there's no evidence in the description to suggest these are involved.\n*   CWE-120: This relates to buffer copies without checking size, but the vulnerability is specifically about reading out of bounds, not writing.\n*   CWE-617: This relates to reachable assertions, but the assertion is being added as a mitigation, not as the cause of the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-1284 and CWE-1285: These relate to improper validation of specified quantity and index, but the specific issue is with an array index, making CWE-129 a better fit.\n*   CWE-122: This relates to heap-based buffer overflows, but the description doesn't specify where the buffer is allocated, making CWE-125 a more general and applicable choice.",
