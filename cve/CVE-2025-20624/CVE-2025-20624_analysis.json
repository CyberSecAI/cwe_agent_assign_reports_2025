The vulnerability description and CVE summary clearly point to the **exposure of sensitive information** as the core issue, leading to information disclosure.\n\nCWE-200, \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\" is the most fitting, despite being discouraged. The vulnerability description uses almost the exact same words. The root cause is the **exposure of sensitive information** to an unauthorized actor for some Edge Orchestrator software. The impact is information disclosure via adjacent access.\n\nCWE-284, \"Improper Access Control\" is a possible secondary candidate, but it's a high-level Pillar and less descriptive.\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 is at a Class level because there isn't enough information to select a more specific Base or Variant CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
