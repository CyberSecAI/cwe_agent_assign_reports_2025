While CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE, CWE-532 is a Base-level CWE, making it more appropriate for this specific vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly states that sensitive information is being inserted into a log file, which directly aligns with CWE-532.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insertion of sensitive information into the log file** (**CWE-532**), which then leads to the exposure of this information to an attacker (**CWE-200**). The root cause is the **improper handling of sensitive data** that should not be included in the logs.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly supports the selection of CWE-532 as the primary CWE, given the direct mention of \"**insertion of sensitive information into log file**\" in both the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The retriever results also list CWE-532 as the top candidate.\n\nThe relationship analysis confirms that CWE-532 is a more specific instance of CWE-200. The mapping guidance for CWE-200 discourages its use when lower-level CWEs are applicable, further reinforcing the choice of CWE-532.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the act of inserting sensitive information into the log file. This is supported by evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary, which both highlight this specific weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
