# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-49194

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-49194

## Description

Databricks JDBC Driver before 2.6.40 could potentially allow remote code execution (RCE) by triggering a JNDI injection via a JDBC URL parameter. The vulnerability is rooted in the **improper handling of the krbJAASFile parameter**. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to achieve Remote Code Execution in the context of the driver by tricking a victim into using a crafted connection URL that uses the property krbJAASFile.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** improper handling of the krbJAASFile parameter
- **Impact:** remote code execution (RCE)
- **Vector:** crafted connection URL with krbJAASFile property
- **Product:** Databricks JDBC Driver
- **Version:** before 2.6.40

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-917 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection') | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE - This is the most accurate CWE because the vulnerability is a JNDI injection via a JDBC URL parameter. |
| CWE-74 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection') | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate - CWE-74 is a high-level injection class, but CWE-917 is more specific. |
| CWE-502 | Deserialization of Untrusted Data | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate - JNDI injection often leads to deserialization issues, but the root cause is the injection itself. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the hierarchical relationship between CWE-74 (Injection) and CWE-917 (Expression Language Injection). CWE-917 is a more specific type of injection, making it a better fit for the vulnerability description. CWE-502 is included since the JNDI injection could lead to deserialization of untrusted data.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of the krbJAASFile parameter** in the JDBC driver. This leads to a JNDI injection vulnerability, which can then be exploited to achieve remote code execution (RCE).
  - **Root Cause:** **Improper handling of the krbJAASFile parameter** (CWE-917).
  - **Vulnerability:** JNDI Injection
  - **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE)

## Summary of Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-917 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')), with a confidence score of 0.9. This is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions a JNDI injection via a JDBC URL parameter, due to the **improper handling of the krbJAASFile parameter**. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section confirms that the root cause is the **improper handling of the `krbJAASFile` parameter**, allowing for JNDI injection.

CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) was considered but is too general. While the vulnerability is an injection, CWE-917 is more specific to expression language injection, which is the nature of the vulnerability.

CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data) was also considered because JNDI injection often leads to deserialization issues. However, the primary issue is the injection itself, making CWE-917 the more accurate root cause.

The selection of CWE-917 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately describes the **root cause** of the vulnerability (JNDI injection via a crafted connection URL), while remaining at the Base level of abstraction.
Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
