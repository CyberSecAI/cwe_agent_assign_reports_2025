This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file general/hr/setting/attendance/leave/data.php of the component Annual Leave Handler. The manipulation leads to **improper authorization**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **improper authorization**
- **product:** Tongda OA
- **version:** 11.2/11.3/11.4/11.5/11.6
- **component:** Annual Leave Handler in general/hr/setting/attendance/leave/data.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `general/hr/setting/attendance/leave/data.php` file of Tongda OA. This file lacks proper login verification, allowing unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing Authentication:** The primary weakness is the absence of login verification for the `data.php` file. This allows unauthenticated users to access and manipulate data.
*   **Improper Authorization:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized modification of annual leave rest time data.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  It also allows the viewing of all system user names without any authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify annual leave data, potentially causing disruptions in HR records and leave management.
*   **Information Exposure:** Attackers can gain access to the names of all system users, which could be leveraged for further attacks or social engineering.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct HTTP Request:** Attackers can directly access the vulnerable `data.php` file through a web browser or other HTTP clients without logging in.  The provided link indicates the file can be reached via `http://192.168.0.106/general/hr/setting/attendance/newLeave/add.html` which will invoke the vulnerable `data.php` file

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable Tongda OA instance. No prior login or credentials are required.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in Tongda OA versions v11.2 to v11.6.
*   The vulnerable endpoint is related to HR settings, specifically leave and attendance.
*   The Github issue provides images that demonstrate the vulnerability by modifying annual leave data, which is called by `general/hr/setting/attention/newLeave/add.html`, and by viewing a list of system users.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| **Indicator**                                              | **Likely CWE** |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| No identity check (no login)                               | CWE-306        |
| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
