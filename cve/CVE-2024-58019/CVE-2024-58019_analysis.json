  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved nvkm/gsp correctly advance the read pointer of GSP message queue A GSP event message consists three parts message header, RPC header, message body. GSP calculates the number of pages to write from the total size of a GSP message. This behavior can be observed from the movement of the write pointer. However, nvkm takes only the size of RPC header and message body as the message size when advancing the read pointer. When handling a two-page GSP message in the non rollback case, It wrongly takes the message body of the previous message as the message header of the next message. As the message length tends to be zero, in the calculation of size needs to be copied (0 - size of (message header)), the size needs to be copied will be 0xffffffxx. It also triggers a kernel panic due to a **NULL pointer error**. [ 547.614102] msg 00000f90 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 40 d7 18 fb 8b 00 00 00 ........@.......
