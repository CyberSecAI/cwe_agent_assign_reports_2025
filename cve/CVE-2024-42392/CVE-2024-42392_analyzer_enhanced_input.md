## Vulnerability Description
**Improper Neutralization of Delimiters** vulnerability in Cesanta Mongoose Web Server v7.14 allows to trigger an infinite loop bug if the input string contains unexpected characters.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Improper Neutralization of Delimiters**
- **impact:** infinite loop
- **vector:** input string with unexpected characters
- **product:** Cesanta Mongoose Web Server
- **version:** v7.14

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-42392

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper neutralization of delimiters in the Cesanta Mongoose Web Server library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability lies in how the Mongoose Web Server v7.14 handles input strings, specifically when these strings contain unexpected characters acting as delimiters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can trigger an infinite loop bug by providing specially crafted input strings. This leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, where the server becomes unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending an input string containing unexpected characters to the vulnerable web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send data to the vulnerable Mongoose Web Server.
- The attack has a CVSS score of 4.0, with vectors specified as:
    - **AV:L** (Local)
    - **AC:H** (High)
    - **PR:H** (High)
    - **UI:R** (Required)
    - **S:U** (Unchanged)
    - **C:N** (None)
    - **I:N** (None)
    - **A:H** (High)
This indicates that the attack requires local access, a high level of privileges, user interaction, and results in a high impact on availability, but no impact on confidentiality or integrity.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory suggests not exposing the vulnerable component in an untrusted network.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Gabriele Quagliarella of Nozomi Networks.
- The affected version is Cesanta Mongoose Web Server v7.14.
