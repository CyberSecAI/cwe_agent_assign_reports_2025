## Vulnerability Description
sigstore-python is a Python tool for generating and verifying Sigstore signatures. Versions of sigstore-python newer than 2.0.0 but prior to 3.6.0 perform **insufficient validation of the integration time** present in v2 and v3 bundles during the verification flow the integration time is verified *if* a source of signed time (such as an inclusion promise) is present, but is otherwise trusted if no source of signed time is present. This does not affect v1 bundles, as the v1 bundle format always requires an inclusion promise. Sigstore uses signed time to support verification of signatures made against short-lived signing keys. The impact and severity of this weakness is *low*, as Sigstore contains multiple other enforcing components that prevent an attacker who modifies the integration timestamp within a bundle from impersonating a valid signature. In particular, an attacker who modifies the integration timestamp can induce a Denial of Service, but in no different manner than already possible with bundle access (e.g. modifying the signature itself such that it fails to verify). Separately, an attacker could upload a *new* entry to the transparency service, and substitute their new entrys time. However, this would still be rejected at validation time, as the new entrys (valid) signed time would be outside the validity window of the original signing certificate and would nonetheless render the attacker auditable.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient validation of the integration time**
- **impact:** Denial of Service
- **product:** sigstore-python
- **version:** newer than 2.0.0 but prior to 3.6.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-55655:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the "integration time" within "v2" and "v3" Sigstore bundles. Specifically, the "integration time" was trusted if no other source of signed time was available, while it should have always been verified.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation of the "integration time" when a bundle lacked another source of signed time.
- **CWE-20** Improper Input Validation - Failing to validate the timestamp from the bundle
- **CWE-325** Missing Verification of Integrity Check - The integrity check of the integration time was conditional, not mandatory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could modify the integration timestamp within a bundle, leading to a DoS. This is because the verification process would fail.
- **Potential for bypassing timestamp verification:** Although not fully exploitable to forge a valid signature, the vulnerability allowed an attacker to modify the integration time without proper verification, which could be leveraged for other attacks.
- The impact of the vulnerability is rated as *low* because there are other checks that prevent an attacker from using this to create a valid, impersonated signature

**Attack vectors:**
- **Bundle Manipulation:** The attacker would need to be able to modify the Sigstore bundle.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Bundle Access:** The attacker requires access to the Sigstore bundle that they intend to modify.
- **No Signing Key Required:** The attacker does not need to compromise any signing keys

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability affects sigstore-python versions >= 2.0.0 and < 3.6.0.
- The vulnerability does *not* affect "v1" bundles since "v1" bundles require an inclusion promise
- The fix implemented in version 3.6.0 requires the presence of an inclusion promise if no other source of signed time is present.
