  "description": "The Brizy - Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.1. This is due to **missing or incorrect nonce validation** on form submissions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to submit forms intended for public use as another user via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. On sites where unfiltered_html is enabled, this can lead to the admin unknowingly adding a Stored **Cross-Site Scripting** payload.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on form submissions within the Brizy \u2013 Page Builder plugin.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary vulnerability is CSRF, which allows an attacker to forge requests on behalf of a logged-in user.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Form Submission as Another User:** An attacker can trick a site administrator into performing actions through forged requests, such as submitting forms intended for public use.\n*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** On sites where `unfiltered_html` is enabled, an attacker can inject a stored XSS payload into the site through the forged form submissions. This can lead to further compromise, such as unauthorized access to the admin interface or data exfiltration, when the malicious payload is triggered.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Forged Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious link or form that is designed to submit data to the vulnerable form endpoint in the plugin.\n*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in site administrator into clicking on the malicious link or submitting the malicious form.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to initiate the attack.\n*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must be able to trick an administrator into clicking a link or submitting a form.\n*   **Knowledge of vulnerable form endpoints:** The attacker needs to know which forms lack proper nonce validation and how to craft requests for them.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n*   The provided changelog in the first content snippet does not explicitly mention a security fix. However, the second content snippet from Wordfence indicates that the vulnerability was patched in version 2.5.2.\n* The Wordfence article provides a CVSS score of 4.3 (Medium) and a CVSS vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N.",
