CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery) is considered a secondary CWE because manipulating the destination could lead to SSRF. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe941[\"CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\"]\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    \n    cwe941 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe918\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe941 primary\n    class cwe918 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect specification of the destination** in the communication channel (CWE-941). An attacker can **manipulate the parameter**, which directly controls the destination of a request. This manipulation could then lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CWE-918), where the attacker makes the server send requests to unintended destinations, potentially exposing sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness lies in the ability to control the request destination. This aligns directly with CWE-941, \"Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\". The vulnerability description states that an attacker can \"**control the destination of a request by manipulating the parameter**\".\n\nCWE-941 is a base-level CWE, providing an appropriate level of specificity. The description of CWE-941 states: \"The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\"\n\nCWE-918, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), is considered a secondary candidate because the ability to control the request destination could lead to SSRF if an attacker redirects the request to an internal service.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-74 \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\" was considered but not selected. This is too general, as the issue is specifically about the destination, not about general injection.\n*   CWE-78 \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\" was considered but not selected because it is not directly related to OS command injection.\n*   CWE-79 \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\" was considered but not selected because it is not directly related to Cross-site scripting.\n*   CWE-306 \"Missing Authentication for Critical Function\" was considered but not selected because there is no direct evidence in the description that authentication is missing.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a
