# Analysis Report for CVE-2025-47936

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-47936

## Description

TYPO3 is an open source, PHP based web content management system. In versions on the 12.x branch prior to 12.4.31 LTS and the 13.x branch prior to 13.4.2 LTS, Webhooks are inherently vulnerable to **Cross-Site Request Forgery** (CSRF), which can be exploited by adversaries to target internal resources (e.g., localhost or other services on the local network). While this is not a vulnerability in TYPO3 itself, it may enable attackers to blindly access systems that would otherwise be inaccessible. An administrator-level backend user account is required to exploit this vulnerability. Users should update to TYPO3 version 12.4.31 LTS or 13.4.12 LTS to fix the problem.

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | 0.9 | Compound | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-918 | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**. The vulnerability description and CVE summary both explicitly mention CSRF as the root cause. The secondary weakness is **CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**, as the CSRF can be exploited to target internal resources, effectively leading to SSRF.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**, where an attacker can trick an administrator into making requests. This leads to **CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**, where the attacker can then target internal resources.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment was based on the vulnerability description identifying **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** as the root cause. The CVE summary reinforced this by mentioning that "Webhooks are inherently vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)." However, the description explicitly states that "Webhooks are inherently vulnerable to **Cross-Site Request Forgery** (CSRF), which can be exploited by adversaries to target internal resources". This suggests that the CSRF is the primary vulnerability, which then enables SSRF.

The graph relationships influenced the decision to classify **CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** as the primary CWE, as it is the initial flaw that leads to the subsequent SSRF. **CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** is a secondary vulnerability.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. **CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** is a Compound CWE, but it accurately represents the combined weaknesses that must occur simultaneously for the attack to succeed. **CWE-918 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** is a Base CWE, which is appropriate for mapping the resulting vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
