# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-47936

## Vulnerability Description
TYPO3 is an open source, PHP based web content management system. In versions on the 12.x branch prior to 12.4.31 LTS and the 13.x branch prior to 13.4.2 LTS, Webhooks are inherently vulnerable to **Cross-Site Request Forgery** (CSRF), which can be exploited by adversaries to target internal resources (e.g., localhost or other services on the local network). While this is not a vulnerability in TYPO3 itself, it may enable attackers to blindly access systems that would otherwise be inaccessible. An administrator-level backend user account is required to exploit this vulnerability. Users should update to TYPO3 version 12.4.31 LTS or 13.4.12 LTS to fix the problem.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Cross-Site Request Forgery**
- **impact:** access internal resources
- **attacker:** adversaries
- **product:** TYPO3
- **version:** 12.x branch prior to 12.4.31 LTS and the 13.x branch prior to 13.4.2 LTS
- **component:** Webhooks

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
Root cause of vulnerability:
Webhooks are inherently vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

Impact of exploitation:
Attackers can target internal resources (e.g., *localhost* or other services on the local network).

Attack vectors:
Via webhooks.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
An administrator-level backend user account is required to exploit this vulnerability.

Mitigation or fix:
Update to TYPO3 versions 12.4.31 LTS, 13.4.12 LTS.
To mitigate potential SSRF risks via webhooks, it is recommended to explicitly allow access only to trusted hosts. This can be achieved by configuring the allowlist in `$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['HTTP']['allowed_hosts']['webhooks']`.
