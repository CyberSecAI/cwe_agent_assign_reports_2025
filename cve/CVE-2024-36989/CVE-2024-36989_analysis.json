  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36989:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of access control within the Splunk Web Bulletin Messages system. This allows low-privileged users, who do not have \"admin\" or \"power\" roles, to create and send notifications to all users on the Splunk instance.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Missing Access Control:** The core weakness is the insufficient access control mechanism for the Splunk Web Bulletin Messages. Low-privileged users can send notifications, which should be restricted to higher privileged roles.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Information Disclosure (Low):** Malicious actors can use the vulnerability to send links to users which could direct them to websites that may contain malicious material or attempt to phish credentials.\n- **Integrity (High):** Attackers can modify the content displayed to all users through notifications, potentially injecting malicious content or misleading information through a seemingly trusted source, which all users receive.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network, requiring network access to the Splunk web interface.\n- **Web Interface:** Exploitation occurs through the Splunk Web interface using the Bulletin Messages system.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- **Low-Privilege User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the Splunk instance, but does not need elevated (\"admin\" or \"power\") privileges.\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the Splunk instance web interface.\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n- The advisory notes that notifications can contain web links, which could result in users navigating to external sites or unintentionally executing searches.\n- Splunk has rated this vulnerability as Medium severity (6.5) with a CVSS vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N\n- The provided Splunk detection logic searches for unauthorized notification input and is configured to look for potentially malicious activity related to this vulnerability.\n- The detection is considered \"experimental\" indicating it is not fully tested or officially supported.\n- The fix involves upgrading to Splunk Enterprise versions 9.2.2, 9.1.5, 9.0.10 or higher or Splunk Cloud Platform to versions 9.1.2312.200 or higher.\n- A potential workaround involves disabling Splunk Web, but this may limit functionality.",

While more specific Base or Variant CWEs are generally preferred, the evidence points to a high-level issue of incorrect permission assignment leading to a resource being exposed to unauthorized users. The relationship to CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is relevant, as incorrect permission assignment can directly lead to failing authorization checks. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information) is considered as a consequence of the **incorrect permissions**, but it is not the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe732 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe732 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect permission assignment** (CWE-732), which allows low-privileged users to bypass authorization checks (CWE-285). This leads to the ability to create notifications, potentially exposing sensitive information or malicious content to all users (CWE-200).\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n  - **Weakness:** CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n  - **Impact:** CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis, supported by the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\", indicates that the core issue is a **lack of access control**, enabling low-privileged users to perform actions reserved for administrators or power users. The \"Vulnerability Description\" confirms this by stating that low-privileged users \"could create notifications...that all users on the instance receive.\"\n\nCWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) directly addresses this **root cause**. The notification system is the critical resource, and the permissions are incorrectly assigned, allowing unauthorized access.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) were considered due to the potential for malicious content injection. However, they represent impacts of the **missing access control**, not the primary weakness itself.\n\nThe selection of CWE-732 is at the Class level due to the lack of a more specific Base or Variant CWE that captures the **incorrect permission assignment** in this context. Further investigation might reveal a more granular weakness, but based on the available evidence, CWE-732 provides the most accurate and relevant classification.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
