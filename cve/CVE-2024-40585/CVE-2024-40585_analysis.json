CWE-200 [CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] represents the resulting impact, where unauthorized actors gain access to sensitive data. CWE-532 is a child of CWE-200, reflecting that the insertion of sensitive information into a log file leads to the exposure of that information. The base level of CWE-532 is chosen as it accurately reflects the specific flaw, while CWE-200 is chosen as a class to represent the general impact of information exposure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe532 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **insertion of sensitive information** into the log file (CWE-532). This leads directly to the **exposure of that sensitive information** to unauthorized actors (CWE-200), who can then retrieve certificate private keys and encrypted passwords.\n\nCWE-532 (Root Cause) -> CWE-200 (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the clear evidence provided in the vulnerability description and CVE reference. The **root cause** is explicitly stated as \"An **insertion of sensitive information into log file** vulnerabilities [CWE-532]\". This directly maps to CWE-532. The impact, \"allows any low privileged user with access to event log section to retrieve certificate private key and encrypted password logged as system log,\" leads to the secondary classification of CWE-200, representing the **exposure of sensitive information**.\n\nThe hierarchical relationship (CWE-532 is a child of CWE-200) confirms that the insertion of sensitive information is the specific mechanism by which the information is exposed. The selection of CWE-532 as the primary CWE is justified because it represents the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The base level of CWE-532 provides sufficient specificity, and the class level of CWE-200 adequately captures the impact.\n\nCWE-200 was considered as the primary CWE, but was deemed less appropriate because the **root cause** is the **insertion of sensitive information into a log file**, not simply the **exposure of sensitive information**.\nCWE-778 [CWE-778: Insufficient Logging] was considered because logging is involved, but the problem isn't about **insufficient logging**, it is the **insertion of sensitive information** into the log.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-778: Insufficient Logging\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen a security-critical event occurs, the product either does not record the event or omits important details about the event when logging it.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes sensitive information to a log file.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
