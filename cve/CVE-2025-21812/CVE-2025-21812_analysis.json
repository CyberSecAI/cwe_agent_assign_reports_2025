The vulnerability description clearly states \"**locking order violation**\" and \"**DEADLOCK**\". The retriever results also suggest CWE-667 (Improper Locking) and CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) which are contributing factors.\n\nThe evidence directly supports the identification of CWE-833 as the primary issue, with the other CWEs representing contributing factors or related conditions. The final selection reflects the direct evidence and the relationships between the identified weaknesses.
