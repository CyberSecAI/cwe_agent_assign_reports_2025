CWE-256 is a more specific case of CWE-522, making it a better fit. The abstraction levels also influenced the decision, prioritizing the Base level (CWE-256) over the Class level (CWE-522) for the primary mapping.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Plaintext Storage of Password** (CWE-256)\n2.  **Impact:** Attacker in privileged position can obtain access passwords, leading to potential unauthorized access and compromise of the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, particularly the vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the affected web server stored the password in **cleartext**. The CVE reference links content summary confirms this as the **root cause of the vulnerability**.\n\nThe relationship graph confirms the child-parent relationship between CWE-256 and CWE-522. Given the direct statement of plaintext storage, CWE-256 is the more appropriate and specific classification.\n\nThe selection of CWE-256 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the **root cause** described in the vulnerability. While CWE-522 also applies, it is a broader category.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
