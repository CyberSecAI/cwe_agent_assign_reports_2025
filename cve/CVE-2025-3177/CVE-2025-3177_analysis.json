  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-3177 Content\n\nBased on the provided content, this relates to a vulnerability in Fastcms v0.1.5.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is JWT hard coding within the Fastcms application. A default JWT key is used, allowing attackers to forge identity tokens.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   JWT hard coding\n*   Identity forgery\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation allows attackers to forge identity tokens, potentially gaining unauthorized access or performing actions as legitimate users.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker can use the hardcoded JWT key to create valid tokens.\n*   The provided example shows a GET request with a crafted Authorization header.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to know the hardcoded JWT key.\n*   No specific position is required, as the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Do not use the default JWT key.\n*   Implement a mechanism to add the JWT key as a startup parameter when starting the project.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The affected product is Fastcms v0.1.5.\n*   The vendor is identified as <https://www.xjd2020.com/> and the code repositories are provided.\n*   The issue report includes screenshots demonstrating the JWT construction and the request example.\n*   The vulnerability was reported by cds.\n*   The issue was opened on March 27, 2025.",

CWE-259 [CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password] is a peer of CWE-321 and also a child of CWE-798. Because the vulnerability specifically involves a cryptographic key, CWE-321 is a more specific and appropriate choice than its parent CWE-798. CWE-259 is another variant of CWE-798, but is less specific than CWE-321 in this context.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe321 -- PEEROF --> cwe259\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe798,cwe259 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a hard-coded cryptographic key** (CWE-321). This allows an attacker to forge JWT tokens, leading to potential unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary vulnerability is the **use of a hard-coded cryptographic key** in the JWT handler of FastCMS 0.1.5. The vulnerability description explicitly states, \"The manipulation leads to **use of hard-coded cryptographic key**.\" The CVE reference links content summary confirms this, stating, \"The root cause is JWT hard coding within the Fastcms application. A default JWT key is used, allowing attackers to forge identity tokens.\"\n\nCWE-321 [CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key] is the most specific and appropriate CWE, as it directly addresses the **use of a hard-coded cryptographic key**. It is a Variant level CWE, which is preferred. The retriever results also list CWE-321 as a highly relevant CWE.\n\nCWE-798 [CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials] is a broader CWE that encompasses various types of hard-coded credentials. While relevant, it is less specific than CWE-321.\n\nCWE-259 [CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password] is another variant of CWE-798, but it is specific to passwords. Since the vulnerability involves a cryptographic key, CWE-321 is a more precise fit.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but deemed less relevant:\n\n*   CWE-1391 [CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials]: This is a class-level CWE and less specific than CWE-321.\n*   CWE-89 [CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')]: This is not related to the described vulnerability.\n*   CWE-79 [CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]: This is not related to the described vulnerability.\n*   CWE-327 [CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm]: This CWE addresses the **use of a broken algorithm**, not the **use of a hard-coded key**.\n*   CWE-434 [CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type]: This is not related to the described vulnerability.\n*   CWE-1336 [CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine]: This is not related to the described vulnerability.\n*   CWE-425 [CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')]: This is not related to the described vulnerability.\n*   CWE-472 [CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter]: This is not related to the described vulnerability.\n*   CWE-639 [CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key]: This is not related to the described vulnerability.\n*   CWE-303 [CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm]: This is not related to the described vulnerability.\n*   CWE-319 [CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information]: This is not related to the described vulnerability.\n*   CWE-178 [CWE-178: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity]: This is not related to the described vulnerability.\n*   CWE-471 [CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)]: This is not related to the described vulnerability.\n*   CWE-94 [CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')]: This is not related to the described vulnerability.\n*   CWE-184 [CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs]: This is not related to the described vulnerability.",
