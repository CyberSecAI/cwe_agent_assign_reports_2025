| CWE-307 | Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | The product does not implement sufficient measures to prevent multiple failed authentication attempts within a short time frame.|
| CWE-287 | Improper Authentication | 0.5 | Class | Discouraged | When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct. This is a class level CWE and the description is generic.|
| CWE-613 | Insufficient Session Expiration | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | According to WASC, "Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization." The vulnerability allows an attacker to re-submit a valid TOTP token to establish an authenticated session. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is the **reuse of TOTP tokens multiple times**, which violates the one-time-use principle. CWE-307, "Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts", is a good fit because the system doesn't prevent **reuse of TOTP tokens multiple times** within a short time frame. CWE-287, "Improper Authentication", is a class-level CWE and a more general case. CWE-613, "Insufficient Session Expiration", is related but less direct, as the core issue isn't session expiration, but rather the **reuse of TOTP tokens multiple times** within a session's validity period.

## Vulnerability Chain
1.  **Root Cause:** The system does not properly restrict **reuse of TOTP tokens multiple times** within the validity period.
2.  **Weakness:** The system fails to invalidate a TOTP token after its first successful use.
3.  **Impact:** An attacker can re-submit a valid TOTP token to establish an authenticated session, even if the token was previously used.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-307, "Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts," because the core vulnerability is the system's failure to prevent **reuse of TOTP tokens multiple times** within a short time frame. This aligns with the root cause and the technical details provided. The evidence directly supports this classification. I am also considering CWE-287 and CWE-613 as secondary mappings. CWE-287 is a class level CWE and is a more general case of failing to properly authenticate. CWE-613 is related, because the attacker is able to establish an authenticated session using the **reuse of TOTP tokens multiple times**. However, CWE-307 is more specific to the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
According to WASC, "Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization."

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not implement sufficient measures to prevent multiple failed authentication attempts within a short time frame.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
