## Vulnerability Description
**Incorrect validation of files loaded from a local untrusted directory** may allow local privilege escalation if the underlying operating systems is Windows. This may result in the application executing arbitrary behaviour determined by the contents of untrusted files. This issue affects MongoDB Server v5.0 versions prior to 5.0.27, MongoDB Server v6.0 versions prior to 6.0.16, MongoDB Server v7.0 versions prior to 7.0.12, MongoDB Server v7.3 versions prior 7.3.3, MongoDB C Driver versions prior to 1.26.2 and MongoDB PHP Driver versions prior to 1.18.1. Required Configuration Only environments with Windows as the underlying operating system is affected by this issue

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Incorrect validation of files loaded from a local untrusted directory**

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-7553:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the incorrect validation of files loaded from a local untrusted directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The core issue is that the software does not properly control or validate the files it loads from user-specified directories. This allows an attacker to introduce malicious files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** On Windows systems, this flaw allows for local privilege escalation.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By controlling the contents of the loaded files, an attacker can execute arbitrary code, potentially gaining full control over the system.
- **Arbitrary Behaviour:** The application can be forced to exhibit arbitrary behavior as determined by the malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to the system to place malicious files in a directory that the vulnerable application will load from.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to write to a local directory that the vulnerable application will access.
- The attacker needs to trick the vulnerable application into loading from the untrusted directory.
- This vulnerability only affects systems running Windows.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- MongoDB Server v5.0 versions prior to 5.0.27
- MongoDB Server v6.0 versions prior to 6.0.16
- MongoDB Server v7.0 versions prior to 7.0.12
- MongoDB Server v7.3 versions prior to 7.3.3
- MongoDB C Driver versions prior to 1.26.2
- MongoDB PHP Driver versions prior to 1.18.1

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set ‚Äì Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* üîç *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* üîç *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion ‚Äì CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### üî∏ CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúA user created with the ‚Äòguest‚Äô role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúThe backup service runs as root but only needs read access.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### üî∏ CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúUser can access another user‚Äôs invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.‚Äù*

## Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *‚ÄúUser can escalate privileges to admin.‚Äù*
> ‚ùå Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged ‚Äì only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ‚úÖ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**
