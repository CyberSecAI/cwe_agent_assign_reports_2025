Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the debug interface. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it as a format specifier. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the device.",
