## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the absence of file extension validation for uploaded files in the `/admin/post-avehical.php` file of the "Car Rental Project in PHP and Mysql".

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Attackers can exploit this file upload vulnerability to gain control of the website server and further access all data on the server, posing a serious threat to system security and business continuity.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Exploiting the unrestricted upload vulnerability in `/admin/post-avehical.php` by uploading a webshell.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Exploiting this vulnerability requires logging into the backend.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   1.  Implement strict file type validation: Validate both the file extension (using a whitelist) and the actual MIME type (via finfo or similar) to ensure uploaded files match expected types. Reject files with mismatched extensions or suspicious content.
*   2.  Secure file storage and naming: Store files outside the web root directory, rename them with unpredictable UUIDs, and set restrictive permissions (e.g., 700). Disable script execution in upload directories via server configuration (e.g., .htaccess rules).
*   3.  Apply input sanitization and limits: Sanitize all user inputs related to file paths (e.g., remove ../ sequences) and enforce strict size limits to prevent oversized or malicious payloads. Use CAPTCHA or rate limiting to deter automated attacks.
*   4.  Regular security audits: Conduct routine code reviews and penetration testing to identify and patch vulnerabilities in file upload handling, including outdated dependencies or misconfigurations.
