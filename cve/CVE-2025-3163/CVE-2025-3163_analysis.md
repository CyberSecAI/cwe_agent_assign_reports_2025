# Analysis for CVE-2025-3163

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-913 | Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources | 0.9 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE |
| CWE-494 | Download of Code Without Integrity Check | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-913, a Class-level weakness. CWE-494, a Base-level weakness, is considered as a secondary candidate due to the "Download of Code Without Integrity Check". CWE-913's relationship to CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data) and CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) suggest other potential avenues for dynamic code execution. The choice of CWE-913 is due to its broad coverage of dynamically managed code resources, while CWE-494 is a more specific case. The graph shows that CWE-494 can precede CWE-79, indicating a potential chain of vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper control of dynamically-managed code resources** (CWE-913) due to the unsafe use of `exec` and `compile` functions. An attacker modifies the `version.py` file, injecting malicious code. This leads to arbitrary code execution, potentially resulting in data theft, system compromise, or other malicious activities. If code is downloaded without integrity check that leads to CWE-494.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on **code injection**, as mentioned in the vulnerability description. However, further examination of the CVE reference links revealed that the root cause is the **unsafe use of `exec` and `compile` functions** and the **lack of input validation** of the `version.py` file before execution. This led to the selection of CWE-913 as the primary CWE, as it encapsulates the broader issue of improper control over dynamically managed code resources. The evidence from the CVE reference links explicitly states the use of `exec(compile(f.read(), version_file, 'exec'))` as the source of the vulnerability. CWE-494 "Download of Code Without Integrity Check" is a secondary concern if that is part of the process of the attack.

The graph relationships influenced the consideration of potential chains, such as CWE-494 potentially leading to CWE-79. However, the evidence primarily supports the direct execution of injected code, making CWE-913 the most appropriate primary classification.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-913 being a Class that covers the general problem of dynamically-managed code resources, and CWE-494 as a base weakness describing code download without integrity checks.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an LDAP query using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended LDAP query when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed

**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
