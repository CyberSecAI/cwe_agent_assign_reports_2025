## Vulnerability Description
Exposure of Environmental Variables and arbitrary INI file values to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in The Document Foundation LibreOffice. URLs could be constructed which expanded environmental variables or INI file values, so potentially sensitive information could be exfiltrated to a remote server on opening a document containing such links. This issue affects LibreOffice from 24.8 before < 24.8.4.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

## CVE-2024-12426 Analysis

This content is directly related to CVE-2024-12426 and provides detailed information beyond the placeholder description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

URLs could be constructed which expanded environmental variables or INI file values, potentially allowing sensitive information to be exfiltrated to a remote server when opening a document containing such links.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Improper URL handling leading to expansion of environmental variables and INI file values within URLs.
*   Potential for information disclosure via exfiltration of sensitive data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Exfiltration of arbitrary INI file values and environment variables to a remote server. This could expose sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Opening a malicious document containing specially crafted URLs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Ability to create a document with malicious URLs.
*   Ability to deliver the malicious document to a target user.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Upgrade to LibreOffice 24.8.4 or later. The fix disables the expansion feature for document-hosted URLs.
