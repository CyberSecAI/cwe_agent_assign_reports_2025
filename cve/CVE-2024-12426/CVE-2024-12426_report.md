# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-12426

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-12426

## Description

Exposure of Environmental Variables and arbitrary INI file values to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in The Document Foundation LibreOffice. URLs could be constructed which expanded environmental variables or INI file values, so potentially sensitive information could be exfiltrated to a remote server on opening a document containing such links. This issue affects LibreOffice from 24.8 before < 24.8.4.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Weakness:** exposure of environmental variables and arbitrary INI file values to an unauthorized actor
- **Impact:** information exfiltration
- **Vector:** opening a document containing such links
- **Product:** LibreOffice
- **Version:** 24.8 before < 24.8.4

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-526 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in an Environment Variable | 0.7 | Variant | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the choice of CWE-200 is its broad applicability to information exposure scenarios. While CWE-526 is more specific, the description doesn't definitively confirm cleartext storage in environment variables, making CWE-200 a safer, more general classification. The chain is environmental variables being exposed leading to potential information leakage.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **exposure of environmental variables and arbitrary INI file values** due to improper handling of URLs. This leads to the potential for **information exfiltration** when a user opens a document containing such links. The root cause is the **weakness** in how LibreOffice processes URLs, leading to the unintended disclosure of sensitive data.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause and the specific type of weakness present. The analysis is heavily based on the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which explicitly mentions the **exposure of environmental variables and arbitrary INI file values**.

The selection of CWE-200 is based on the fact that the core issue is the **exposure of sensitive information** to an unauthorized actor. The CVE summary directly supports this.

CWE-526 was considered because the vulnerability involves environmental variables, but it's not explicitly stated that they are stored in cleartext. Therefore, it is classified as a secondary candidate.

The final decision reflects a balance between specificity and accuracy, given the available evidence. CWE-200 provides an appropriate level of detail.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an externally controlled name or reference that resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70

**Description**:
The product uses a cryptographic primitive that uses an Initialization
			Vector (IV), but the product does not generate IVs that are
			sufficiently unpredictable or unique according to the expected
			cryptographic requirements for that primitive.
			

**Mapping Guidance**:
