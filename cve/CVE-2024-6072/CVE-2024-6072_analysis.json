When the victim accesses the vulnerable page, the injected script is executed.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and lure the victim to click on it (e.g., through phishing). The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.",
