## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-617 | Reachable Assertion | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a reachable assertion. |
| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability involves a crafted NAS packet with a zero-length EMM message length, suggesting improper validation of the length parameter. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the decision is the direct match of the vulnerability description to CWE-617. Additionally, the relationship of CWE-1284 as a child of CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) suggests a potential input validation issue related to the length parameter. CWE-617 is a Base level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a crafted NAS packet containing a zero-length EMM message. The `ogs_nas_emm_decode` function then triggers a **reachable assertion** due to this zero-length message, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). The **lack of proper validation** of the EMM message length is a contributing factor.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-617 because the vulnerability description explicitly states "A **reachable assertion**". This aligns directly with the CWE's definition. The confidence is high because of this direct match and the evidence in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary which states "The `ogs_nas_emm_decode` function in Open5GS asserts if the received NAS packet has zero length."

CWE-1284 is included as a secondary CWE because the crafted NAS packet has a zero-length EMM message length. This suggests that the length parameter was not validated properly. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary supports this with "weaknesses": ["Unchecked input length"].

The selection of CWE-617 and CWE-1284 is at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause (**reachable assertion**) and a contributing factor (**improper validation of specified quantity in input**) of the vulnerability.

The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71

## CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs multiple related behaviors, but the behaviors are performed in the wrong order in ways which may produce resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
