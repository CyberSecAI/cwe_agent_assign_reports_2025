While more specific Base or Variant CWEs are generally preferred, the provided information does not offer enough detail to pinpoint a more specific cause. CWE-862's parent is CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), and it has children like CWE-425 (Direct Request). CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information) is often a consequence of missing authorization and represents the impact of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe200 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe285,cwe425 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing authorization** (CWE-862), which allows an unauthenticated user to **access non-sensitive information** (CWE-200). The root cause is the lack of proper authorization checks, leading to the information exposure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates that an unauthenticated user can access non-sensitive information due to **missing authorization**. This directly aligns with CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). While the information is non-sensitive, the fact that it should have been restricted suggests an authorization issue. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is considered a secondary CWE, representing the impact of the missing authorization. Though the description says the information isn't sensitive, the summary also says the information \"would otherwise be restricted\" implying that an exposure has occurred. The retriever results also support CWE-862 and CWE-200.\n\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization) was considered but not chosen as it's a more general class. CWE-862 is a more specific child and therefore a better fit.\n\nRelevant evidence includes:\n*   \"allows an unauthenticated user to **access non-sensitive information** about the server which **would otherwise be restricted**\"\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**NOT USED:** While this could be relevant, the vulnerability description states the information is non-sensitive.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**NOT USED:** This is not relevant since the vulnerability is about missing authorization, not about relying on untrusted inputs.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
