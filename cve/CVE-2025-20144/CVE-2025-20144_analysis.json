This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of packets when a specific configuration of the hybrid ACL exists.\n*   **Impact:** A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass a configured ACL on the affected device. The overall impact of exploitation is organization specific because it depends on the importance of the assets that the ACL was supposed to protect.\n*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic through an affected device.\n*   **Affected Products:**\n    *   IOS XR White box (IOSXRWBD)\n    *   Network Convergence Series (NCS) 540 Series Routers\n    *   NCS 560 Series Routers\n    *   NCS 5500 Series\n    *   NCS 5700 Series\n*   **Determine if affected:**\n    1.  Use the command `show running-config | include ipv4 access-group .* compress level 3`\n        *   If output is returned, a hybrid IPv4 ACL is configured.\n        *   If not configured, the device is not affected.\n    2.  Examine the ACLs using the command `show access-list <Name of ACL>`.\n        *   If the number of different source or destination network object groups is 32 or more, proceed to Step 3.\n        *   If the number is less than 32, the ACL is not affected.\n    3.  Examine the object groups using the command `show object-group network ipv4 <name of each network object-group>`. If the same IPv4 prefix, host, or range entry is found in 32 or more of the source network object groups or in 32 or more of the destination network object groups, then the ACL is affected by this vulnerability.\n*   **Workaround:**\n    *   Examine the object groups that make up the ACL. If the same IPv4 source or destination or both appear more than 31 times in object groups that comprise the ACL, remove access control entries until there are 31 or fewer entries of the same IPv4 address in both the source and destination entries.\n*   **Fix:** Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.\n    *   7.11.2\n    *   24.1 and later - Not affected.\n\n**More detail than the official CVE description:** The content provides a more detailed description of the vulnerability, including how to determine if a device is affected and a workaround. The content also provides specific commands and steps to identify vulnerable configurations.",

CWE-284 is a higher-level, more general weakness. Since there is specific evidence of **incorrect handling of packets when a specific configuration of the hybrid ACL exists** leading to the bypass of ACL, CWE-863 is more appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect handling of packets** due to a specific ACL configuration, which then leads to the bypass of the ACL, ultimately resulting in unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the provided information, the **root cause** of the vulnerability is the **incorrect handling of packets when a specific configuration of the hybrid ACL exists**, which leads to the bypass of the configured ACL. This aligns with CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization).\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states that the issue is due to **incorrect handling of packets when a specific configuration of the hybrid ACL exists**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also supports this, mentioning that the **vulnerability** is due to **incorrect handling of packets when a specific configuration of the hybrid ACL exists**.\n\nCWE-863 is chosen because the **incorrect handling** leads to an authorization bypass. The mapping guidance for CWE-863 is Allowed-with-Review because it is a Class-level CWE, however, given the information available, it is the most accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-284 (Improper Access Control) was considered, but it is too general. While the vulnerability does result in bypassing access control, the **root cause** is more specifically related to **incorrect authorization**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
