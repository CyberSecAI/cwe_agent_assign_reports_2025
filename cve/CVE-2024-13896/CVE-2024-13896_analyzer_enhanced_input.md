## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## CVE-2024-13896 Analysis

The provided content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2024-13896 and provides more detail than the placeholder description. Here's an extraction of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `wp_geshi_filter_replace_code()` function within the WP-GeSHi-Highlight plugin. This function processes user-supplied input as a regular expression.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS):** A specially crafted input can cause the regular expression engine to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial of service.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:**  The server's CPU usage can be driven to 100% per core, impacting server performance and potentially causing it to become unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An authenticated attacker with author privileges can publish a post containing a malicious payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "author" privileges.
*   **Payload Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a ReDoS payload (e.g., using `str_repeat('<pre lang="php">', 20000)` in PHP).

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **No known fix:** As of the provided information, there is no known fix available for this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Plugin:** WP-GeSHi-Highlight <= 1.4.3
*   **CVSS Score:** 2.2 (Low)
*   **Researcher:** Pierre Rudloff
*   **WPVDB ID:** b8b622ea-e090-45ad-8755-b050fc055231
*   **Proof of Concept:** The provided content includes steps to reproduce the vulnerability, involving publishing a post with a crafted payload and monitoring server resource usage.
*   **Publicly Published:** 2025-03-20
