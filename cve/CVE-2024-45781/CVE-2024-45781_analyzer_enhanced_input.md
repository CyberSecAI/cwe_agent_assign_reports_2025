# Vulnerability Description

    A flaw was found in grub2. When reading a symbolic links name from a UFS filesystem, grub2 **fails to validate the string length taken as an input**. The **lack of validation** may lead to a **heap out-of-bounds write**, causing data integrity issues and eventually allowing an attacker to circumvent secure boot protections.
