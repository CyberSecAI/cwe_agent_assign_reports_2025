  "keyphrases": {
    "rootcause": "A deadlock occurs during system shutdown because the audio driver holds a mutex while waiting on I/O via blk_mq_submit_bio(), and the UFS shutdown process attempts to acquire the same mutex after having set SDEV_QUIESCE for all LUs.",
    "weakness": "The UFS shutdown process did not properly handle ongoing I/O requests, specifically those initiated by other drivers like the audio driver. The SDEV_QUIESCE setting was not sufficient to prevent a deadlock."
