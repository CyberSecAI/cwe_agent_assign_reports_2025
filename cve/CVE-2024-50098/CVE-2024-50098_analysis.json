  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi ufs core Set SDEV_OFFLINE when UFS is shut down There is a history of deadlock if reboot is performed at the beginning of booting. SDEV_QUIESCE was set for all LUs scsi_devices by UFS shutdown, and at that time the audio driver was waiting on blk_mq_submit_bio() holding a mutex_lock while reading the fw binary. After that, a deadlock issue occurred while audio driver shutdown was waiting for mutex_unlock of blk_mq_submit_bio(). To solve this, set SDEV_OFFLINE for all LUs except WLUN, so that any I/O that comes down after a UFS shutdown will return an error.

  "reference_content": "The provided content pertains to a fix for a deadlock issue in the Linux kernel's UFS (Universal Flash Storage) driver, and is relevant to the CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- A deadlock could occur during reboot if the UFS shutdown process set `SDEV_QUIESCE` for all Logical Units (LUs) while another process (like an audio driver) was waiting on `blk_mq_submit_bio()` holding a mutex lock. This could lead to a deadlock when the audio driver shutdown waited for the mutex unlock.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- The use of `scsi_device_quiesce` during UFS shutdown did not properly prevent new I/O operations from being initiated, which resulted in the deadlock scenario described above.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- The system would become deadlocked during a reboot operation.\n- The system would become unresponsive and require a hard reset.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Triggering a system reboot while the UFS subsystem and other drivers (such as an audio driver) are active and performing I/O operations.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker would need to be in a position to trigger a reboot of the affected system.\n- The attacker would need no special privileges.\n\n**Technical Details**\n- The fix replaces `scsi_device_quiesce(sdev)` with setting the device state to `SDEV_OFFLINE` using `scsi_device_set_state(sdev, SDEV_OFFLINE)` protected by a mutex. This ensures that any new I/O requests after UFS shutdown return an error, preventing the deadlock scenario. The write-once logical unit (WLUN) is excluded from this change.\n- The commit messages include a kernel log showing the call trace leading to the deadlock.",

CWE-833 is a base-level CWE, providing a specific description of the deadlock condition. CWE-667 and CWE-362 are class-level CWEs that describe the broader categories of locking and synchronization issues that contribute to the deadlock.

The UFS shutdown process and the audio driver concurrently attempt to access the same resource (mutex), resulting in the system becoming unresponsive. The fix involves setting the device state to `SDEV_OFFLINE` to prevent new I/O requests, addressing the root cause of the deadlock.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **CWE-833 (Deadlock)** as the primary vulnerability due to the system becoming unresponsive. The supporting evidence from the vulnerability description clearly indicates a deadlock situation. The **root cause** involves **improper locking** (CWE-667) and **concurrent execution with improper synchronization** (CWE-362). The retriever results also highlighted CWE-833 as a potential match. The relationship analysis confirmed that CWE-833 is the specific outcome of the locking and synchronization issues, making it the most appropriate primary CWE.
