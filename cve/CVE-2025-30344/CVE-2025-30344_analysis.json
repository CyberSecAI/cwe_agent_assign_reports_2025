This allows to insert various HTML tags, such as `a href`. When trying to insert a `<script>` tag, it gets properly encoded when reflected. But adding attributes to links is possible, which allows the injection of JavaScript by the `onmouseover` tag and others. When a user moves the mouse over such a prepared link, JavaScript will be executed in that user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s session.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:** When a user moves the mouse over such a prepared link, JavaScript will be executed in that user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s session.\n\n**Attack vector:** The XSS can be triggered by authenticated users.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated user.\n\n**Proof of Concept:**\n```\nPOST /system/action/handle_request HTTP/2\nHost: localhost:8000\nCookie: refreshId=bearer%20ey...\nContent-Length: 256\nSec-Ch-Ua-Platform: \"Linux\"\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9\nSec-Ch-Ua: \"Chromium\";v=\"133\", \"Not(A:Brand\";v=\"99\"\nAuthentication: bearer ey...\nSec-Ch-Ua-Mobile: ?0\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/133.0.0.0 Safari/537.36\nAccept: application/json, text/plain, */*\nContent-Type: application/json\nNgsw-Bypass: true\nOrigin: https://localhost:8000\nSec-Fetch-Site: same-origin\nSec-Fetch-Mode: cors\nSec-Fetch-Dest: empty\nReferer: https://localhost:8000/1/agenda/topics/1\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\nPriority: u=1, i\n\n[{\"action\":\"topic.update\",\"data\":[{\"id\":1,\"text\":\"<p>Link with XSS<a target=\\\"_self\\\" rel=\\\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\\\" href=\\\"http://www.x41-dsec.de\\\" onmouseover=\\\"alert(1\n)\\\">XXXXXXX</a>X</p>\",\"title\":\"X41 Summer BBQ\",\"attachment_mediafile_ids\":[]}]}]\n```\n```\n**Severity Rating:** Medium\n**Vector:** Timing Sidechannel\n**CVE:** CVE-2025-3034\n**CWE:** 208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**CVSS Score:** 5.3\n**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N\n**Fix:** <https://github.com/OpenSlides/openslides-auth-service/pull/686/>\n\n**Analysis:** During login at the endpoint `/system/auth/login/` the system\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response times differ depending on whether a user exists in the system. The timing discrepancy stems from the omitted hashing of the password. On the tested system, that discrepancy was 15ms for a non-existing user to 200ms for an existing user.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:** The timing discrepancy stems from the omitted hashing of the password.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Timing Sidechannel.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:** The timing discrepancy stems from the omitted hashing of the password.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any specific capabilities.\n\n**Proof of Concept:**\nAs seen in `openslides-auth-service/auth/src/api/services/user-service.ts`, the user password is not hashed and checked when `isExisting()` fails.\n```\n**Severity Rating:** Low\n**Vector:** HTML Injection\n**CVE:** CVE-2025-30345\n**CWE:** 79 - Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation\n**CVSS Score:** 3.5\n**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N\n**Fix:** <https://github.com/OpenSlides/openslides-client/pull/4774/>\n\n**Analysis:** When creating new chats via the `chat_group.create` action, the user is able to specify the name for the chat. Some HTML tags such as `script` are filtered, whereas others are not. In most cases, the HTML entities will be encoded properly, but not when deleting chats or deleting messages in these chats. This allows attackers to mess with the layout of the rendered website.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:** This allows attackers to mess with the layout of the rendered website.\n\n**Proof of Concept:**\nInserting a HTML bold tag in the chat name causes part of the message in the confirmation dialog to be rendered bold.\n```\n**Severity Rating:** Low\n**Vector:** Directory Traversal\n**CVE:** CVE-2025-30343\n**CWE:** 23 - Relative Path Traversal\n**CVSS Score:** 2.6\n**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N\n**Fix:** <https://github.com/OpenSlides/openslides-client/pull/4775/>\n\n**Analysis:** Files can be uploaded to OpenSlides meetings and organized in folders. The interface allows users to download a ZIP archive that contains all files in a folder and its subfolders. If an attacker specifies the title of a file or folder as a relative or absolute path (e.g. `../../../etc/passwd`), the ZIP archive generated for download will convert that title into a path. Depending on the extraction tool used by the user, this might overwrite files locally outside of the choosen directory.\n```",
