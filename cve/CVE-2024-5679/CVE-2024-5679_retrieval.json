This occurs when a program writes data beyond the allocated buffer, potentially overwriting other parts of memory.\\n*  **Impact of Exploitation:**\\n    *   Local denial-of-service (DoS).\\n    *   Kernel memory leak.\\n*   **Attack Vectors:** A malicious actor with local user access can craft a script/program using an IOCTL call in the `Foxboro.sys` driver to trigger the vulnerability.\\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n    *   Local user access to the workstation running Foxboro DCS Core Control Services.\\n    *   Ability to execute crafted scripts/programs.\\n\\nThe document also notes that the vulnerability is present in EcoStruxure\u2122 Foxboro DCS Core Control Services versions 9.8 and prior.
