This can lead to memory corruption, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution. **CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read** is considered as a secondary weakness, which could potentially lead to information disclosure through reading sensitive data. The relationship is that an out-of-bounds write can potentially follow from an out-of-bounds read. Both CWE-787 and CWE-125 are children of **CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**, but CWE-119 is too abstract and discouraged.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe125 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a malicious actor with local user access crafting a script/program using an IOCTL call. This leads to an **CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write** in the Foxboro.sys driver, which can then result in local denial-of-service or kernel memory leak. The vulnerability could also potentially lead to **CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly points towards **CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write** as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the existence of an **Out-of-Bounds Write** vulnerability that could cause local denial-of-service, or kernel **memory leak** when a malicious actor with local user access crafts a script/program using an IOCTL call in the Foxboro.sys driver.\n\nThe retriever results also support this with **CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write** scoring the highest across all key phrases (**ROOTCAUSE**, **WEAKNESS**, **IMPACT**, **VECTOR**, **ATTACKER**, **COMPONENT**).\n\n**CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read** is considered as a secondary weakness, which could potentially lead to information disclosure through reading sensitive data.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but ultimately not selected. **CWE-131 Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size** was considered since it could lead to a buffer overflow but there's no evidence to suggest this is the case here. **CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer** was not selected as it is a
