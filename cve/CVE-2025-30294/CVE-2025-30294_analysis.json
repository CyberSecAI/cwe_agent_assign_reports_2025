This can lead to **CWE-284: Improper Access Control** and **CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**. **CWE-284** and **CWE-200** represent impacts of the initial **improper input validation**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe284 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe200\n    cwe20 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe284\n    cwe20 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe284,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**. Due to this weakness, a high-privileged attacker can bypass security protections (**security feature bypass**). This leads to **CWE-284: Improper Access Control**, as the attacker gains unauthorized access. Finally, this results in **CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** as the attacker can read sensitive data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and keyphrase breakdowns. The description clearly states the root cause is an **\"Improper Input Validation vulnerability\"** leading to a **\"security feature bypass\"** and **\"unauthorized read access\"**.\n\n**CWE-20: Improper Input Validation** is the most appropriate primary CWE because it directly addresses the **root cause** described in the vulnerability description. The key phrase \"Improper Input Validation vulnerability\" explicitly points to this weakness. The description of CWE-20 aligns perfectly with the **root cause**: \"The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly.\"\n\nThe impact of bypassing security features and gaining unauthorized read access suggests secondary weaknesses related to access control and information exposure. **CWE-284: Improper Access Control** and **CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** are considered as secondary CWEs to describe impact.\n\nThe retriever results consistently highlight **CWE-20** as the top candidate for the given keyphrases related to input validation. This further strengthens the selection of **CWE-20** as the primary CWE.\nThe relationships show **CWE-20** as the root cause which leads to **CWE-284** and **CWE-200** in a chain.\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they are base-level CWEs that accurately represent the identified weaknesses and impacts.",
