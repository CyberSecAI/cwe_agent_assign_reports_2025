Since the vulnerability description explicitly states that passwords are stored unencrypted (plaintext), CWE-256 is a more specific and accurate representation of the weakness than its parent, CWE-522.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **unencrypted storage** of passwords in the `config.xml` file (CWE-256). This leads to the exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized users with sufficient permissions (Item/Extended Read).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which clearly states that passwords are stored **unencrypted** in `config.xml` files. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this, stating \"The vulnerability is that passwords are stored in plain text.\" This direct evidence supports the selection of CWE-256 [Plaintext Storage of a Password] as the primary CWE. While CWE-522 [Insufficiently Protected Credentials] is a valid consideration, CWE-256 provides a more specific and accurate characterization of the root cause.\n\nThe graph relationship shows that CWE-256 is a child of CWE-522, confirming that it's a specialized case of insufficiently protected credentials.
