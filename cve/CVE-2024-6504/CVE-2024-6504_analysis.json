  "description": "Rapid7 InsightVM Console versions below 6.6.260 suffer from a **protection mechanism failure** whereby an attacker with network access to the InsightVM Console can cause it to overload or crash by sending repeated invalid REST requests in a short timeframe, to the Consoles port 443 causing the console to enter an exception handling logging loop, exhausting the CPU. There is no indication that an attacker can use this method to escalate privilege, acquire unauthorized access to data, or gain control of protected resources. This issue is fixed in version 6.6.261.",

This leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400)**, eventually resulting in a denial-of-service condition due to CPU exhaustion. A potential, but less directly supported, prerequisite is a **missing authentication check (CWE-306)**, which allows unvalidated requests to reach the resource allocation stage.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n  - **Weakness:** CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n  - **Impact:** Denial of Service (CPU exhaustion, Console crash)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary classification is CWE-770, \"Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling,\" due to the vulnerability description indicating that the Rapid7 InsightVM Console does not properly limit or throttle the allocation of resources when processing invalid REST requests. This **lack of limits** leads to the console entering an exception handling logging loop and exhausting the CPU.\n\nThe evidence supporting this decision includes:\n- **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases:** \"**protection mechanism failure**\", \"**overload or crash**\", \"**repeated invalid REST requests**\"\n- **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"The Security Console could be overloaded by sending invalid requests at a high rate, causing it to enter an exception-handling logging loop that exhausts the CPU.\"\n\nCWE-400, \"Uncontrolled Resource Consumption,\" is considered a secondary CWE, as it describes the resulting state of the system after the resources are exhausted. While CWE-400 is a valid consequence, CWE-770 more accurately represents the **root cause**. The mapping guidance for CWE-400 discourages its use when it is conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs.\n\nCWE-306, \"Missing Authentication for Critical Function,\" was considered because the vulnerability involves repeated invalid REST requests, which could potentially bypass authentication checks. However, the description does not explicitly mention a **missing authentication mechanism**, making this mapping less certain.\n\nThe final selection is based on the provided evidence, focusing on the **root cause** of the vulnerability and selecting the most specific CWE that accurately represents the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.47\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-789\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-774\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-20\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-1325\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-400\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Abstraction Level**: class\n**Similarity Score**: 2.55\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs.
