CWE-200, Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor, is a Class level weakness that represents the impact of the missing masking.

The primary **root cause** identified is the **missing password masking** in the web-based SSH authentication component, which directly leads to the **exposure of the password**. The graph relationships reinforce the selection of CWE-549 as the primary cause and CWE-200 as a secondary consequence.
