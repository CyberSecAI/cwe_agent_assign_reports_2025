## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE Report for code-projects Hospital Management System Using PHP With Source Code v1.0

This content is **RELEVANT** to a potential CVE, as it details a security vulnerability in a specific software product. It provides more detail than a standard CVE description would likely contain.

Here's an extraction of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient user input validation for the "doctorspecilization" parameter. The application directly uses user-supplied input in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection (specifically, time-based blind SQL injection)

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   System control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   POST request to `/hms/admin/doctor-specilization.php` with a malicious payload in the `doctorspecilization` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This is the primary recommended mitigation.
*   **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.
*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Limit the privileges of the database account used by the application.
*   **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address vulnerabilities.

**Specific details:**

*   **Affected Product:** Hospital Management System Using PHP With Source Code
*   **Affected Version:** v1.0
*   **Vulnerable File:** `doctor-specilization.php`
*   **Payload Example:** `doctorspecilization=123' AND (SELECT 9138 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))vSBV) AND 'QECR'='QECR`
