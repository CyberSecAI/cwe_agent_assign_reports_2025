## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/imagination avoid deadlock on fence release Do scheduler queue fence release processing on a workqueue, rather than in the release function itself. Fixes deadlock issues such as the following [ 607.400437] ============================================ [ 607.405755] WARNING possible **recursive locking** detected [ 607.415500] -------------------------------------------- [ 607.420817] westonzfq0/24149 is trying to acquire lock [ 607.426131] ffff000017d041a0 (reservation_ww_class_mutex){+.+.}-{33}, at pvr_gem_object_vunmap+0x40/0xc0 [powervr] [ 607.436728] but task is already holding lock [ 607.442554] ffff000017d105a0 (reservation_ww_class_mutex){+.+.}-{33}, at dma_buf_ioctl+0x250/0x554 [ 607.451727] other info that might help us debug this [ 607.458245] Possible unsafe locking scenario [ 607.464155] CPU0 [ 607.466601] ---- [ 607.469044] lock(reservation_ww_class_mutex) [ 607.473584] lock(reservation_ww_class_mutex) [ 607.478114] *** DEADLOCK ***
