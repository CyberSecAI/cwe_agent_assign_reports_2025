  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2024-55070\n\n**1. Verification:**\n\nThe content directly discusses CVE-2024-55070, describing it as a broken access control vulnerability where \"Users can share recipes of other groups.\" This aligns with the general concept of access control issues.\n\n**2. Extracted Information:**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Interchanging the recipeId in the API call `POST /api/shared/recipes` with a recipe ID from another group allows users to share recipes they don't own.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control. Specifically, insufficient validation of recipe ownership when sharing recipes.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Users can view recipes from groups they do not belong to. The users of the other group are unaware that the recipe is being shared.\n*   **Attack vectors:** Manipulating the `recipeId` parameter in the `POST /api/shared/recipes` API call.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A standard user account within the Mealie application.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.5.0 of Mealie.\n*   **CVSS Score:** 3.1 Low\n\n**3. Additional Details (More than official CVE description):**\n\nThe blog post provides a detailed explanation of how the vulnerability works, including screenshots of the API calls and the resulting behavior. It also provides a timeline of discovery and disclosure. It notes that the frontend does not display shares initiated by users outside the recipe's group.",

The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data. |\n| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary candidate. The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-639, which is a Base level CWE. CWE-863 is a Class level CWE and a parent of CWE-942. CWE-639 is more specific than CWE-863 which makes it a better choice for the primary CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe942[\"CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains\"]\n    \n    cwe942 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe **root cause** is **Broken Object Level Authorization** which leads to the impact that group managers can edit their own permissions, or a user can view recipes from groups they do not belong to. The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper authorization checks when handling user-controlled keys or identifiers.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **Broken Object Level Authorization** as the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The description highlights that group managers can edit their own permissions, which should not be allowed, indicating an authorization issue. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that users can share recipes of other groups due to insufficient validation of recipe ownership when sharing recipes.\n\nThe Retriever Results pointed to several potential CWEs, with CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) being the top candidate. This CWE aligns well with the vulnerability description, as the issue involves manipulating the `recipeId` parameter, which acts as a user-controlled key, to access resources (recipes) that should be restricted.\n\nThe CWE Classification Guidance further reinforces the selection of authorization-related CWEs. It emphasizes the distinction between authentication and authorization issues and provides guidance on choosing the appropriate CWE based on the nature of the flaw.\n\nBased on the evidence and the guidance, CWE-639 is selected as the primary CWE because it accurately captures the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the ability to bypass authorization checks by manipulating user-controlled keys.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was considered as a secondary candidate, as it represents a broader class of authorization errors. However, CWE-639 is more specific and provides a better description of the vulnerability.\n\nOther CWEs, such as CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), were deemed too general. CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) and CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges) were not applicable because the issue does not involve privilege misassignment or unnecessary privileges.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-639 is based on the following:\n\n*   The vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly indicate an authorization bypass issue.\n*   CWE-639 directly addresses the manipulation of user-controlled keys to bypass authorization checks.\n*   The CWE Classification Guidance supports the selection of specific authorization-related CWEs over more general ones.\n*   The Retriever Results identified CWE-639 as the top candidate.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, as it accurately reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability and provides a clear understanding of the weakness.",
