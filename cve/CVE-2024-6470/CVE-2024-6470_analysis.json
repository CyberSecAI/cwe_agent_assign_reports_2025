CWE-1336 is a child of CWE-94. CWE-94 is a parent of CWE-1336. The selection of CWE-1336 is more specific than CWE-94, aligning with the principle of selecting the most detailed CWE when evidence supports it.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1336 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in a template engine (CWE-1336). The **lack of sanitization** of user input allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the template, which leads to code execution (CWE-94).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability in playSMS 1.4.3. The application **does not properly sanitize user-supplied input** in the 'Receiver number' and 'Description' fields within the Group inbox feature. This **lack of sanitization** allows an attacker to inject a payload (e.g., `{{id}}`) into the 'Receiver number' and/or 'Description' fields when creating or editing a group. This leads to authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE), where an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-1336, which accurately describes the root cause of the vulnerability: the application's **failure to neutralize special elements** used in the template engine. The **manipulation of the argument Receiver Number with the input {{`id`}} leads to injection**.\n\nCWE-94 is considered a secondary candidate because the **lack of input sanitization** leads to code execution. The evidence indicates that the vulnerability involves the **improper neutralization** of special elements, which leads to code injection, making CWE-1336 the more specific and appropriate choice for the primary CWE.\n\nThe vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary provide sufficient evidence to support the classification. The relationship analysis further clarifies the connection between the root cause and the potential impact.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
