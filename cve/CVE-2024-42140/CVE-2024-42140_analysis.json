  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved riscv kexec Avoid deadlock in kexec crash path If the kexec crash code is called in the interrupt context, the machine_kexec_mask_interrupts() function will trigger a deadlock while trying to acquire the irqdesc spinlock and then deactivate irqchip in irq_set_irqchip_state() function. Unlike arm64, riscv only requires irq_eoi handler to complete EOI and keeping irq_set_irqchip_state() will only leave this possible deadlock without any use. So we simply remove it.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content describes a fix for a deadlock vulnerability in the Linux kernel's kexec crash path on RISC-V architecture. This is achieved by removing a redundant call to `irq_set_irqchip_state()`.\n\n- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `machine_kexec_mask_interrupts()` function, when called in an interrupt context, attempted to acquire the `irqdesc` spinlock and then deactivate the irqchip using `irq_set_irqchip_state()`. This resulted in a deadlock since the spinlock was already held in interrupt context.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The code was attempting to deactivate the irqchip using `irq_set_irqchip_state()` even though on RISC-V, only the `irq_eoi` handler is required to complete EOI. This unnecessary call introduced a potential deadlock.\n- **Impact of exploitation**: A deadlock would occur when the kexec crash code was called within an interrupt context, causing the system to hang.\n- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the kexec crash path is executed in the interrupt context. The kexec crash path is triggered by user-space via `kexec_load`.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need the ability to trigger a kernel crash (e.g. `panic()`) after initiating a kexec load in an environment where the kexec crash path is entered in the interrupt context to trigger a deadlock.\n\nThe patch removes the call to `irq_set_irqchip_state()` and instead uses only the `irq_eoi` handler to complete the EOI process in the `machine_kexec_mask_interrupts()` function for the RISC-V architecture.",

CWE-833 is related to CWE-667 (Improper Locking) and CWE-362 (Race Condition), both of which are Class level CWEs. These relationships helped to refine the selection towards the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe833[\"CWE-833: Deadlock\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    \n    cwe833 -->|CHILDOF| cwe667\n    cwe833 -->|RELATED| cwe362\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe833 primary\n    class cwe667,cwe362 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **rootcause** of a **deadlock in the interrupt context**. This occurs because the `machine_kexec_mask_interrupts()` function attempts to acquire the `irqdesc` spinlock while already in an interrupt context, leading to a deadlock. The unnecessary call to `irq_set_irqchip_state()` exacerbates this issue. The final impact is a system hang.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly indicates a deadlock situation. The **rootcause** is the attempt to acquire a spinlock within an interrupt context, leading to a deadlock. The graph relationships guided the selection of CWE-833 (Deadlock) as the primary CWE due to its direct relevance and base-level specificity. The evidence is sufficient to confidently assign CWE-833 as the primary weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-833: Deadlock\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
