While more specific child CWEs might exist, the provided information does not give enough details to go beyond CWE-200. CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows: A local attacker crafts a file, the application processes it, and this leads to the exposure of sensitive information. The root cause is the improper handling of the crafted file leading to information exposure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the exposure of sensitive information due to a crafted file. The weakness is the **exposure of sensitive information**. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions that a local attacker can \"obtain sensitive information via a crafted file.\"\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a strong candidate, but it is a Class-level CWE and its usage is discouraged. However, without more details about the specific mechanism that allows the crafted file to expose sensitive information, it's challenging to select a more specific CWE.\n\nI considered other CWEs from the retriever results, such as:\n\n*   CWE-202 (Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries): This is not applicable, as the description does not mention data queries.\n*   CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere): This could be a good candidate, but there is no explicit mention of *system* information.\n*   CWE-538 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory): This could be a good candidate, but there is no explicit mention of a new file or directory being created.\n\nBecause the provided information is limited, I am selecting CWE-200 with a confidence of 0.7.",
