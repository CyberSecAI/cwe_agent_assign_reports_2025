## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved KVM x86 Reset IRTE to host control if *new* route isnt postable Restore an IRTE back to host control (remapped or posted MSI mode) if the *new* GSI route prevents posting the IRQ directly to a vCPU, regardless of the GSI routing type. Updating the IRTE if and only if the new GSI is an MSI results in KVM leaving an IRTE posting to a vCPU. The dangling IRTE can result in interrupts being incorrectly delivered to the guest, and in the worst case scenario can result in **use-after-free**, e.g. if the VM is torn down, but the underlying host IRQ isnt freed.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** KVM x86
- **weakness:** **use-after-free**
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **impact:** interrupts being incorrectly delivered to the guest, use-after-free
