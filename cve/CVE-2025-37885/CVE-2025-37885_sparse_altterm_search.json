  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved KVM x86 Reset IRTE to host control if *new* route isnt postable Restore an IRTE back to host control (remapped or posted MSI mode) if the *new* GSI route prevents posting the IRQ directly to a vCPU, regardless of the GSI routing type. Updating the IRTE if and only if the new GSI is an MSI results in KVM leaving an IRTE posting to a vCPU. The dangling IRTE can result in interrupts being incorrectly delivered to the guest, and in the worst case scenario can result in use-after-free, e.g. if the VM is torn down, but the underlying host IRQ isnt freed.",
