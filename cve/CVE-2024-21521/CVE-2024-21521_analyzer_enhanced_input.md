## Vulnerability Description
All versions of the package @discordjs/opus are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to providing an input object with a property toString to several different functions. Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to a system crash.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) and system crash
- **vector:** input object with a property toString
- **product:** @discordjs/opus
- **version:** All versions

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-21521:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `@discordjs/opus` library's failure to properly handle input objects with a `toString` property in several functions. Specifically, the `OpusEncoder` constructor, `setBitrate`, `applyEncoderCTL`, and `applyDecoderCTL` functions are all affected by this issue. When these functions receive an input object with a `toString` property instead of the expected numeric value, they can cause a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Input Handling:** The core vulnerability lies in the library's incorrect assumption about the type of input it is receiving in the functions mentioned above. The code does not validate if the input is a number or an object, leading to a crash when an unexpected type of input is passed. This is a type confusion vulnerability.
- **Lack of Type Validation:** The absence of proper type validation makes the code susceptible to this kind of attack. The library should have explicit checks to ensure that numeric values are being passed, instead of any object with a `toString` property.
- **Denial of Service:** The primary consequence of this vulnerability is the ability to trigger a denial-of-service condition. By crafting a malicious input, an attacker can cause the application using the library to crash, resulting in downtime.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **System Crash:** Successful exploitation leads to a crash of the application or service using the affected `@discordjs/opus` library. This results in service unavailability for legitimate users.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability enables an attacker to perform a denial-of-service attack, preventing the legitimate operation of the affected service or application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited through the network. An attacker can send crafted requests containing the malicious input.
- **Input Manipulation:** Attackers manipulate the input passed to vulnerable functions to trigger the crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send network requests to the affected application using the vulnerable library.
- **Ability to Control Input:** The attacker must be able to craft or control the input data passed to the vulnerable functions within the `@discordjs/opus` library.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require any prior authentication, making it relatively easy to exploit.

**Additional Details:**

- **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided gist contains Proof-of-Concept code (`poc.js`) demonstrating how to trigger the crashes in multiple ways using functions of the library, confirming the vulnerability.
- **Affected Functions:** The `OpusEncoder` constructor, `setBitrate`, `applyEncoderCTL`, and `applyDecoderCTL` functions are vulnerable to this issue.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability is rated as high severity with a CVSS score of 7.5 by Snyk.
- **No Fixed Version:** According to the Snyk vulnerability report, there isn't a fixed version for `@discordjs/opus` as of the report.

This analysis provides more details than the typical CVE description, particularly about the specific vulnerable functions and the technical mechanism of the vulnerability.
