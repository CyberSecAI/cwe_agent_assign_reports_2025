CWE-862 is a more specific Base-level CWE that is a child of CWE-285's parent, CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). CWE-425 is another Base-level CWE related to authorization bypass. The choice of CWE-285 as primary reflects the general nature of the **improper authorization**, while CWE-862 and CWE-425 are considered secondary due to potentially more specific but less definitively supported aspects of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe862 -->|PeerOf| cwe425\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe862,cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain involves an **improper authorization** check within the `/rental/ajax.php?action=delete_tenant` component. This leads to a user being able to manipulate the `id` argument and potentially delete tenants they are not authorized to delete.\n\n1.  Root Cause: **Improper Authorization** (CWE-285)\n2.  Weakness: Missing or incorrect authorization check. (CWE-862, CWE-425)\n3.  Impact: Unauthorized deletion of tenants.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states \"**improper authorization**\" as the root cause, making CWE-285 the most appropriate primary classification. The retriever results also list CWE-285 as a candidate.\n\nThe description indicates that manipulation of the `id` argument allows unauthorized actions. This suggests that either the authorization check is missing entirely (CWE-862) or it is being bypassed through direct request (CWE-425) by manipulating the `id`. Both of these are plausible, but the primary cause is still the authorization failure.\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-285 is a more general class of authorization issues, and that CWE-862 and CWE-425 represent more specific scenarios.\n\nThe selection of CWE-285 as the primary CWE, with CWE-862 and CWE-425 as potential secondary CWEs, is based on the available evidence and the CWE hierarchy. The specificity is optimized by acknowledging both the general authorization failure and the potential mechanisms of bypass.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
