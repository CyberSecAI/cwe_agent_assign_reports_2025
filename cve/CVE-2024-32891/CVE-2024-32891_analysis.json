The vulnerability is due to a **race condition** which falls under the definition of CWE-362. |\n| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The **memory corruption** mentioned in the description could manifest as an out-of-bounds write. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is a **race condition** (CWE-362). The potential impact of this **race condition** is **memory corruption**, which could manifest as an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), representing a more specific case of memory corruption. CWE-362 is a Class level CWE, with more specific Base level CWEs, but none of them clearly fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe787 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe362\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** (CWE-362), which leads to **memory corruption**, potentially an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). The impact is a local escalation of privilege.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the root cause is a **race condition**. The **memory corruption** is a consequence of the **race condition**. Therefore, CWE-362 is the primary CWE. The **memory corruption** could manifest as an out-of-bounds write, so CWE-787 is a secondary candidate.\n\nThe evidence supporting the primary CWE is the phrase \"**race condition**\" in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and the full vulnerability description mentioning a **race condition**. The evidence supporting CWE-787 is the \"**memory corruption**\" phrase in the vulnerability description.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as CWE-362 is a Class-level CWE that directly matches the root cause, and CWE-787 is a Base-level CWE that describes a potential manifestation of the **memory corruption**.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-667 (Improper Locking) and CWE-662 (Improper Synchronization): These are related to concurrency issues, but the description specifically mentions a **race condition**, making CWE-362 a more direct match.\n*   CWE-415 (Double Free): While **memory corruption** is mentioned, there is no specific mention of a double free, so this CWE is not as relevant.\n*   CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): The description mentions local escalation of privilege, but the root cause is a **race condition** leading to **memory corruption**, not an authorization issue.\n*   CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment), CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges), CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), CWE-285 (Improper Authorization): The root cause is a **race condition** leading to **memory corruption**, not a privilege or permission issue.",
