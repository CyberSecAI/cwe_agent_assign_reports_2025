  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10319\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the `render` function in the `widgets/content-toggle/layout/frontend.php` file of the \"140+ Widgets | Xpro Addons For Elementor\" WordPress plugin. The plugin did not properly check access permissions for Elementor templates when rendering the content toggle widget.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive information. The plugin retrieves and renders content from Elementor templates without validating if the current user has permissions to view them. This includes unpublished drafts, pending, and private templates.\n- **Inadequate Access Control:** The code fails to properly check the user's capabilities before displaying content of Elementor templates.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- An attacker with Contributor-level access or higher can view the content of private, pending, and draft Elementor templates by using the vulnerable content toggle widget.\n- This could expose sensitive information that was intended to remain confidential, such as unreleased content, project plans, or other private data.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The attack vector is through the frontend rendering of the content toggle widget, where the vulnerability is located.\n- An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with Contributor-level access or higher on the WordPress site.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n-   **Authentication:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the WordPress site.\n-   **Access Level:** The attacker needs to have at least the Contributor role, granting them the ability to create and edit posts.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n-   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.4.6.1 of the plugin.\n-   The vulnerable code is located within the `widgets/content-toggle/layout/frontend.php` file, specifically where the plugin handles the rendering of content from Elementor templates within the content toggle widget.\n-   The fix involved adding checks to ensure only published content is displayed to users. The patched code retrieves the template's post status and only renders the template if its status is 'publish'. Additionally, it adds checks to display a message to users if the template is not published or if they do not have permission to view it.",

The **lack of proper access control** allows attackers to view private, pending, and draft Elementor template data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **Sensitive Information Exposure** as the primary **weakness**, which corresponds to **CWE-200**. The analysis was refined by considering the root cause, which is the **lack of authorization** checks. The vulnerability description clearly states that the plugin does not properly check access permissions for Elementor templates when rendering the content toggle widget. The `render` function in `widgets/content-toggle/layout/frontend.php` is the vulnerable component.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** is based on the vulnerability description's focus on the exposure of sensitive data, such as private, pending, and draft template data. The selection of **CWE-862 Missing Authorization** is based on the root cause analysis identifying that the plugin does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
