It allows a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - specifically, a lack of CSRF protection.\n*   Broken Access Control (OWASP Top 10 - A1)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nA malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions. The specific impact varies depending on the actions available to the compromised user.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nThe attack vector is through Cross-Site Request Forgery, meaning an attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into performing an action on a malicious website.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Unauthenticated - The attacker does not need to be authenticated.\n*   Ability to create a malicious website or inject malicious code into a trusted website.\n*   Ability to trick a logged-in user into visiting the malicious site or clicking a malicious link.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   No official fix is currently available (as of January 16, 2025).\n*   Patchstack offers a vPatch to auto-mitigate the vulnerability even without an official patch.\n*   The vulnerability is considered low priority and unlikely to be exploited.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **Affected Software:** MD Custom content after or before of post plugin\n*   **Vulnerable Versions:** <= 1.0\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.1 (Low Severity)\n*   **PSID:** ca1f050f0549\n*   **Reported by:** SOPROBRO\n*   **Published by:** Patchstack on January 16, 2025\n*   The content also provides links to the plugin page, Patchstack's vulnerability database, and resources on virtual patching and website security.\n*   The content also includes a timeline of the vulnerability disclosure process.",
