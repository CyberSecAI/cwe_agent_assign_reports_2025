## Vulnerability Description
Adept is a language for general purpose programming. Prior to commit a1a41b7, the remoteBuild.yml workflow file uses actions/upload-artifact@v4 to upload the mac-standalone artifact. This artifact is a zip of the current directory, which includes the automatically generated .git/config file containing the runs GITHUB_TOKEN. Seeing as the artifact can be downloaded prior to the end of the workflow, there is a few seconds where an attacker can extract the token from the artifact and use it with the Github API to push malicious code or rewrite release commits in the AdeptLanguage/Adept repository. This issue has been patched in commit a1a41b7.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** push malicious code or rewrite release commits
- **component:** remoteBuild.yml workflow file

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-32958 based on provided content

The provided content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2025-32958. It details a critical vulnerability in the Adept repository related to the exposure of the `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Here's a breakdown of the information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from including the `.git/config` file, which contains the `GITHUB_TOKEN`, when creating artifacts using `actions/upload-artifact@v4`. The workflow file `remoteBuild.yml` uploads the entire current directory as a zip file, unintentionally including sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure Artifact Creation:** The workflow doesn't filter files before creating the artifact, leading to the inclusion of sensitive data.
*   **Exposure of Credentials:** The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is exposed within the artifact.

**Impact of exploitation:**

An attacker who gains access to the artifact can extract the `GITHUB_TOKEN` and use it to:

*   Push malicious code to the repository.
*   Rewrite release commits, potentially injecting backdoors into released software.
*   Compromise the repository's integrity.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Monitoring workflow runs (specifically `remoteBuild.yml`).
*   Downloading the artifact before the workflow completes.
*   Extracting the `GITHUB_TOKEN` from the `.git/config` file within the artifact.
*   Using the token with the GitHub API.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Ability to monitor GitHub workflow runs.
*   Ability to download GitHub artifacts.
*   Basic understanding of the GitHub API.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Filter Artifact Contents:**  Only include necessary files in the artifact, excluding sensitive files like `.git/config` and environment variables. The suggested fix in the advisory is to specify the files to include instead of the current directory.
*   The commit a1a41b7 includes changes to the `remoteBuild.yml` workflow file to remove the `.git` directory before zipping the artifact. Specifically, the lines `find stage -type d -name ".git" -exec rm -rf {} +` and `-x "*/.git/*"` were added to remove the `.git` directory and exclude it from the zip archive.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability affects version 2.7 of Adept and is patched in version 2.8.
*   The CVSS score is 9.8 (Critical).
*   CVSS v3 base metrics are provided: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
*   The vulnerability was reported by jackhac and nopcorn.
*   The advisory includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) outlining the steps an attacker could take to exploit the vulnerability.
