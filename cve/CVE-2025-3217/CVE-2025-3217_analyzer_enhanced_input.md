## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-3217 Content

Based on the provided content, this report details a SQL injection vulnerability in the Phpgurukul e-Diary Management System V1.0. It appears this is a separate finding and not directly related to a formally assigned CVE ID as of the current date. However, the report provides sufficient detail to analyze as a potential vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is insufficient user input validation of the 'emailid' parameter in the `/registration.php` file. The application directly uses this parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   System control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable via the `/registration.php` file.
*   The 'emailid' parameter (POST request) is the entry point for the attack.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the `/registration.php` endpoint.
*   No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.
*   **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.
*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the least necessary privileges.
*   **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.

**Payload Example:**

```
Parameter: emailid (POST)
    Type: time-based blind
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
    Payload: fname=1&lname=1&emailid=anu@gmail.com' AND (SELECT 5454 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))RFlh) AND 'ZAiw'='ZAiw&mobileno=1111111111&newpassword=123456&confirmpassword=123456&submit=
```

**Additional Details:**

The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including a specific payload example and screenshots from `sqlmap` demonstrating the vulnerability. It also includes a suggested repair strategy.

**Note:** The content references a GitHub repository (`rookiekuan/CVE`) which appears to be a personal repository for tracking CVEs. This is not an official CVE source.
