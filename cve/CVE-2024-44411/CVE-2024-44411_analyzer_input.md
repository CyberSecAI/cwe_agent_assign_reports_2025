# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-44411

## Vulnerability Description
D-Link DI-8300 v16.07.26A1 is vulnerable to **command injection** via the msp_info_htm function.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **product:** D-Link DI-8300
- **version:** v16.07.26A1
- **component:** msp_info_htm function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The `msp_info_htm` function in the D-Link DI-8300A1 router firmware is vulnerable due to insufficient input sanitization.
- Specifically, the `flag` and `cmd` parameters, passed via a GET request, are concatenated and directly executed in a system function without filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute commands with the privileges of the web server, potentially leading to complete control of the device.
- In the provided example, the attacker is able to read the `/etc/passwd` file, and write it to a file named 'AAA.txt'.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the `msp_info.htm` endpoint.
- The request includes the `flag` and `cmd` parameters containing the attacker's desired command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the device.
- **Authentication:** While not explicitly stated, the `wys_userid` and `wys_passwd` cookies in the provided proof of concept (POC) suggest the attacker likely needs to be authenticated to perform the exploit.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable URL is `/msp_info.htm`.
- The `flag` parameter is set to `cmd`.
- The `cmd` parameter is where the malicious command is injected.
- Example malicious request:
  `http://192.168.0.1/msp_info.htm?flag=cmd&cmd=`cat%20/etc/passwd%3EAAA.txt``

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided Github content contains a Proof of Concept python script to exploit the vulnerability.
- The D-Link website mentions a Security Bulletin section, but does not appear to have a specific entry about this issue.
