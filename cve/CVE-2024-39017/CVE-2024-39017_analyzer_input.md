# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-39017

## Vulnerability Description
agreejs shared v0.0.1 was discovered to contain a **prototype pollution** via the function mergeInternalComponents. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via injecting arbitrary properties.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **prototype pollution**
- **impact:** execute arbitrary code and denial of service
- **vector:** injecting arbitrary properties
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** agreejs shared
- **version:** v0.0.1
- **component:** mergeInternalComponents function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Type:** Prototype Pollution

**Root Cause:** The `mergeInternalComponents` function in `@agreejs/shared` version 0.0.1 is vulnerable to prototype pollution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The `mergeInternalComponents` function does not properly sanitize or validate input, allowing an attacker to inject a `__proto__` property within the arguments passed to the function, leading to prototype pollution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   By polluting the prototype, attackers can modify the behavior of all objects inheriting from the affected prototype.
*   This can be escalated to denial of service (DoS), remote code execution (RCE), or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, depending on the gadgets and affected parts of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker can call the vulnerable `mergeInternalComponents` function with a specially crafted argument.
*   The argument must contain a `__proto__` property, allowing the attacker to modify the `Object.prototype`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to call the `mergeInternalComponents` function within the application.
*   The attacker needs to be able to control the input arguments to the vulnerable function.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Package:** `@agreejs/shared` version 0.0.1
*   **Affected Component:** `mergeInternalComponents` function
*   **CVSS Score:** 9.8 (CRITICAL)
*   A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) is provided, demonstrating how to trigger the vulnerability using `JSON.parse('{"__proto__":{"test":123}}')` as input.
