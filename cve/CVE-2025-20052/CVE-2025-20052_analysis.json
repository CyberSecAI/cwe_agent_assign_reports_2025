The retriever results suggested more specific CWEs related to authentication and authorization, such as CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function), CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). However, based on the provided information, it is unclear whether the **improper access control** is due to missing authentication, missing authorization, or an incorrect authorization check.

The Retriever Results provided several candidate CWEs, and the \"Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance\" helped refine the selection. Given the limited information about the specific nature of the **improper access control**, CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) was selected as the most appropriate CWE.
