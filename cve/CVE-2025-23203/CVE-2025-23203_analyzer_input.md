# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-23203

## Vulnerability Description
Icinga Director is an Icinga config deployment tool. A Security vulnerability has been found starting in version 1.0.0 and prior to 1.10.3 and 1.11.3 on several director endpoints of REST API. To reproduce this vulnerability an authenticated user with permission to access the Director is required (plus api access with regard to the api endpoints). And even though some of these Icinga Director users are restricted from accessing certain objects, are able to retrieve information related to them if their name is known. This makes it possible to change the configuration of these objects by those Icinga Director users restricted from accessing them. This results in further exploitation, data breaches and sensitive information disclosure. Affected endpoints include icingaweb2/director/service, if the host name is left out of the query icingaweb2/directore/notification icingaweb2/director/serviceset and icingaweb2/director/scheduled-downtime. In addition, the endpoint `icingaweb2/director/services?host=filteredHostName` returns a status code 200 even though the services for the host is filtered. This in turn lets the restricted user know that the host `filteredHostName` exists even though the user is restricted from accessing it. This could again result in further exploitation of this information and data breaches. Icinga Director has patches in versions 1.10.3 and 1.11.1. If upgrading is not feasible, disable the director module for the users other than admin role for the time being.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## CVE-2025-23203 Analysis

The provided content is relevant to CVE-2025-23203. It details a security vulnerability in Icinga Director and provides information about its fix in versions 1.10.3 and 1.11.3. The content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from REST API endpoints being accessible to restricted users, allowing them to retrieve information and potentially modify configurations of objects they shouldn't have access to. Specifically, the issue arises when the host name is omitted from queries to certain endpoints.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** Restricted users can access information about objects they are not authorized to view.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:**  The vulnerability allows unauthorized disclosure of information about restricted objects.
*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The initial report (GHSA-3mwp-5p5v-j6q3) mentions configuration susceptibility to CSRF.  A later release (v1.11.3) addresses a CSRF issue related to property sort tables.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Configuration changes to objects by unauthorized users.
*   Data breaches and sensitive information disclosure.
*   Potential for further exploitation based on disclosed information.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Network access to the Icinga Director REST API endpoints.
*   Authenticated user with limited permissions within the Icinga Director.
*   Specifically, querying endpoints like `icingaweb2/director/service` without specifying a host name.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An authenticated user with some level of access to the Icinga Director.
*   Knowledge of the vulnerable API endpoints and how to query them.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Upgrade:** Upgrade to Icinga Director version 1.10.3 or 1.11.3 (or later).
*   **Disable Access:** If upgrading is not immediately feasible, disable the Director module for users with roles other than administrator.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected endpoints:**
    *   `icingaweb2/director/service?name=service-name` (when host name is omitted)
    *   `icingaweb2/directore/notification`
    *   `icingaweb2/director/serviceset`
    *   `icingaweb2/director/scheduled-downtime`
    *   `icingaweb2/director/services?host=filteredHostName` (returns 200 even when filtered)
*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-23203
*   **GHSA ID:** GHSA-3233-ggc5-m3qg
*   **CWE IDs:** CWE-200, CWE-284
*   **CVSS Score:** 5.5 (Moderate)

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
