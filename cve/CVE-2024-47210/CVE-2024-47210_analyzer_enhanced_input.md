## Vulnerability Description
Gladys Assistant before 4.45.1 allows Privilege Escalation (a user changing their own role) because req.body.role can be used in updateMySelf in server/api/controllers/user.controller.js.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** Privilege Escalation and user changing their own role
- **vector:** req.body.role
- **product:** Gladys Assistant
- **version:** before 4.45.1
- **component:** updateMySelf in server/api/controllers/user.controller.js

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `/api/v1/me` endpoint in Gladys Assistant was vulnerable to mass assignment. This allowed a user to modify their own role by including the `role` parameter in a profile update request.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Mass assignment vulnerability:** The application was not properly filtering or sanitizing user-provided input when updating user profiles. It directly passed the `req.body` to the update function without validating which fields could be updated.
- **Privilege escalation:** By exploiting the mass assignment vulnerability, an attacker could change their role from "user" to "admin".

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Complete control over the application:** An attacker with admin privileges could control all aspects of the application.
- **Displacement of original administrator:** An attacker could potentially kick out the original administrator.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP request to the `/api/v1/me` endpoint while updating their user profile and including a `role` parameter with the value "admin".

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have a user account with the ability to access the `/api/v1/me` endpoint.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported privately through the `security.md` process.
- The fix implemented was to delete the `role` parameter from the request body before passing it to the update function.
- A more robust solution involving `options.fields` for allowlisting fields that can be updated was suggested for the future.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set ‚Äì Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* üîç *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* üîç *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion ‚Äì CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### üî∏ CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúA user created with the ‚Äòguest‚Äô role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúThe backup service runs as root but only needs read access.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### üî∏ CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúUser can access another user‚Äôs invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.‚Äù*

## Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *‚ÄúUser can escalate privileges to admin.‚Äù*
> ‚ùå Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged ‚Äì only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ‚úÖ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**
