This CWE is a base-level weakness. While other CWEs such as integer overflow (CWE-190) and use of out-of-range pointer offset (CWE-823) were considered, CWE-787 most directly reflects the described **memory corruption** issue. CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with WiFi display APIs being invoked with large random inputs leading to **memory corruption** and resulting in CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which indicates that **memory corruption** occurs when WiFi display APIs are invoked with large random inputs. The primary CWE identified is CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), as it directly addresses the **memory corruption** issue. The retriever results also support this, with CWE-787 having the highest score.
