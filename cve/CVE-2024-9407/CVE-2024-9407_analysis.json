  "description": "A vulnerability exists in the bind-propagation option of the Dockerfile RUN --mount instruction. The system does not properly validate the input passed to this option, allowing users to pass arbitrary parameters to the mount instruction. This issue can be exploited to mount sensitive directories from the host into a container during the build process and, in some cases, modify the contents of those mounted files. Even if SELinux is used, this vulnerability can bypass its protection by allowing the source directory to be relabeled to give the container access to host files.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2024-9407:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from improper input validation in the `bind-propagation` option of the Dockerfile `RUN --mount` instruction within Buildah and Podman. This lack of validation allows arbitrary parameters to be passed to the underlying `mount` command.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Improper Input Validation:** The primary vulnerability is the failure to properly sanitize and validate user-provided input for the `bind-propagation` option.\n*   **Arbitrary Parameter Injection:**  The lack of validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary parameters into the `mount` command.\n*   **Bypass SELinux:** An attacker can use `:z` or `:Z` to relabel host directories and bypass SELinux protections, granting the container access to host files.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can mount sensitive directories from the host into a container during the build process.\n*   **Data Modification:** Attackers can potentially modify the contents of the mounted files.\n*   **Unauthorized Access:**  An attacker can gain unauthorized access to host files.\n*   **Bypass SELinux:** The ability to relabel host directories allows attackers to bypass SELinux restrictions, thus escalating the potential damage.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Dockerfile Manipulation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability through a specially crafted Dockerfile using the `RUN --mount` instruction with malicious `bind-propagation` parameters.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Build Privileges:** The attacker requires the ability to build container images on the target system. This could be achieved through compromised credentials or a vulnerable build system.\n*   **Dockerfile Control:** The attacker must have the ability to provide a crafted Dockerfile that includes the vulnerable `RUN --mount` instruction.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability exists in Podman versions through 5.2.3.\n*   The `bind-propagation` option is used when mounting a directory into a container to control how the mount is propagated between the host and the container. This option should take only specific pre-defined values.\n*   The attacker can use the vulnerability to specify arbitrary mount options beyond the scope of the intended usage.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is rated as \"Important\" or \"Moderate\" depending on the specific context of the advisory.\n*   Patches and updates for various Red Hat products, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux and OpenShift Container Platform, are available to address this vulnerability.\n*   NetApp products incorporating Podman may also be susceptible to this vulnerability.\n\nThis information is more comprehensive than the basic CVE description as it delves into the root cause, specific weaknesses, attack vectors, and impact.",

The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **improper input validation** as the root cause, allowing arbitrary parameters to be passed to the mount instruction. This aligns with CWE-20's description of failing to validate input. The ability to inject parameters into the `mount` command directly corresponds to the OS Command Injection. CWE-732 is included as a potential secondary weakness, since the exploitation allows bypassing of SELinux protections. The relationship is that of parent-child and CANPRECEDE relationships. CWE-20 is the base level weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe20\n    cwe732 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe78\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe78,cwe732 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20) in the `bind-propagation` option of the Dockerfile `RUN --mount` instruction. This leads to the ability to inject arbitrary parameters into the `mount` command, which is **OS Command Injection** (CWE-78). The impact is that sensitive directories from the host can be mounted into the container, and their contents modified. Bypassing SELinux can also be achieved (**Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource** (CWE-732)).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, especially the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The root cause is clearly stated as **improper input validation**, which directly maps to CWE-20. The ability to inject arbitrary parameters into the `mount` command leading to the mounting of sensitive host directories into containers maps to OS Command Injection (CWE-78). The vulnerability description also mentions bypassing SELinux.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"The system does not properly validate the input passed to this option, allowing users to pass arbitrary parameters to the mount instruction.\"\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"The vulnerability stems from **improper input validation** in the `bind-propagation` option of the Dockerfile `RUN --mount` instruction within Buildah and Podman. This **lack of validation allows arbitrary parameters to be passed to the underlying `mount` command**.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-20 and CWE-78 is at the optimal level of specificity, as they directly represent the root cause and the immediate consequence of the vulnerability.\n\n**CWE Considerations:**\n\n*   CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')) was considered because the vulnerability allows mounting of sensitive directories. However, the root cause is not related to path traversal, but rather the ability to pass arbitrary parameters to the mount command due to **improper input validation**.\n*   CWE-59 (Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')) was considered but not selected because the vulnerability does not involve following symbolic links.\n*   CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) was considered and included as a secondary weakness since the ability to bypass SELinux is present.\n*   CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')) was considered and included as the ability to inject parameters into the mount command leading to the mounting of sensitive host directories into containers.\n*   CWE-88 (Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')) was considered but not selected because CWE-78 is more descriptive.\n*   CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) was not selected as the vulnerability is unrelated to file uploads.\n*   CWE-184 (Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs) was considered but not selected because there is no specific mention of an incomplete list of disallowed inputs, but rather a general lack of input validation.",
