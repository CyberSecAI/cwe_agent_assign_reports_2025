# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-9407

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability exists in the bind-propagation option of the Dockerfile RUN --mount instruction. The system does not properly validate the input passed to this option, allowing users to pass arbitrary parameters to the mount instruction. This issue can be exploited to mount sensitive directories from the host into a container during the build process and, in some cases, modify the contents of those mounted files. Even if SELinux is used, this vulnerability can bypass its protection by allowing the source directory to be relabeled to give the container access to host files.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper input validation**
- **impact:** mount sensitive directories from host into container and modify contents of mounted files and bypass SELinux protection
- **product:** Docker
- **component:** bind-propagation option of RUN --mount instruction

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2024-9407:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper input validation in the `bind-propagation` option of the Dockerfile `RUN --mount` instruction within Buildah and Podman. This lack of validation allows arbitrary parameters to be passed to the underlying `mount` command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The primary vulnerability is the failure to properly sanitize and validate user-provided input for the `bind-propagation` option.
*   **Arbitrary Parameter Injection:**  The lack of validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary parameters into the `mount` command.
*   **Bypass SELinux:** An attacker can use `:z` or `:Z` to relabel host directories and bypass SELinux protections, granting the container access to host files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can mount sensitive directories from the host into a container during the build process.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers can potentially modify the contents of the mounted files.
*   **Unauthorized Access:**  An attacker can gain unauthorized access to host files.
*   **Bypass SELinux:** The ability to relabel host directories allows attackers to bypass SELinux restrictions, thus escalating the potential damage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Dockerfile Manipulation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability through a specially crafted Dockerfile using the `RUN --mount` instruction with malicious `bind-propagation` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Build Privileges:** The attacker requires the ability to build container images on the target system. This could be achieved through compromised credentials or a vulnerable build system.
*   **Dockerfile Control:** The attacker must have the ability to provide a crafted Dockerfile that includes the vulnerable `RUN --mount` instruction.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Podman versions through 5.2.3.
*   The `bind-propagation` option is used when mounting a directory into a container to control how the mount is propagated between the host and the container. This option should take only specific pre-defined values.
*   The attacker can use the vulnerability to specify arbitrary mount options beyond the scope of the intended usage.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Important" or "Moderate" depending on the specific context of the advisory.
*   Patches and updates for various Red Hat products, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux and OpenShift Container Platform, are available to address this vulnerability.
*   NetApp products incorporating Podman may also be susceptible to this vulnerability.
