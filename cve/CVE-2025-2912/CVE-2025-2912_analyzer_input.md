# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-2912

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in HDF5 up to 1.14.6. It has been declared as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is the function H5O_msg_flush of the file src/H5Omessage.c. The manipulation of the argument oh leads to **heap-based buffer overflow**. The attack needs to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap-based buffer overflow**
- **product:** HDF5
- **version:** up to 1.14.6
- **component:** H5O_msg_flush of src/H5Omessage.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The `H5O_msg_flush` function in `src/H5Omessage.c` at line 1912 fails to properly check buffer boundaries. Specifically, the pointer `p` is calculated as `mesg->raw - H5O_SIZEOF_MSGHDR_OH(oh)`. This calculation, when `oh->version` is set to 1, results in writing outside the allocated buffer.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)

Impact of exploitation:
Out-of-bounds write and potential application crash.

Attack vectors:
Processing of specially crafted HDF5 files.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
Attacker needs to supply a malicious HDF5 file.

Mitigation or fix:
The issue is marked as a blocker for the 2.0.0 release, implying a fix is required.
