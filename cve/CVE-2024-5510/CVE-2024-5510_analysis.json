  "description": "Kofax Power PDF JP2 File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Kofax Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JP2 files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-22019.",

CWE-125 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), indicating a more general class of memory safety issues. CWE-20 is a very general class level CWE that is discouraged. The \"CANPRECEDE\" relationships from CWE-825, CWE-824, CWE-823, and CWE-822 to CWE-125 highlight the potential for vulnerabilities related to pointer handling leading to out-of-bounds reads.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**. This **improper validation** leads to an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125), which enables remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) due to **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states: \"The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JP2 files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object.\" This statement directly supports the selection of CWE-125 as the primary weakness.
