# Vulnerability Description

    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi mac80211 Purge vif txq in ieee80211_do_stop() After ieee80211_do_stop() SKB from vifs txq could still be processed. Indeed another concurrent vif schedule_and_wake_txq call could cause those packets to be dequeued (see ieee80211_handle_wake_tx_queue()) without checking the sdata current state. Because vif.drv_priv is now cleared in this function, this could lead to driver crash. For example in ath12k, ahvif is store in vif.drv_priv. Thus if ath12k_mac_op_tx() is called after ieee80211_do_stop(), ahvif->ah can be NULL, leading the ath12k_warn(ahvif->ah,...) call in this function to trigger the NULL deref below.
