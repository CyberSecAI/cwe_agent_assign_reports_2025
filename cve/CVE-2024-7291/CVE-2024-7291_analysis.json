  "description": "The JetFormBuilder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.4.1. This is due to **improper restriction on user meta fields**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level and above permissions, to register as super-admins on the sites configured as multi-sites.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-7291\n\n**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper restrictions on user meta fields within the JetFormBuilder plugin. Specifically, the plugin allows modification of restricted user meta fields during user registration or update processes.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n*   **Improper Privilege Management:** The plugin fails to adequately restrict which user meta fields can be modified, allowing modification of sensitive fields.\n*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The plugin does not properly validate or sanitize user-provided input when mapping form fields to user meta fields, enabling the injection of arbitrary user metadata.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Attackers with administrator privileges (or higher in a multisite environment) can exploit this vulnerability to elevate their privileges to a super-admin level. This could grant them full control over the WordPress website and network.\n*   **Complete Site Compromise**: By gaining super-admin access, attackers can modify plugins, themes, and perform any administrative action.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, allowing remote exploitation.\n*   **Form Submission:** An attacker would submit a form with fields that map to sensitive user meta fields. This is possible when the administrator has enabled the \"register user\" action, but can also be exploited during \"update user\" action.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrator-level privileges or higher (e.g., a super-admin in a multisite network)\n*   **Knowledge of Plugin Settings**: The attacker needs to know how the form fields are mapped to user meta in the plugin settings.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\nThe vulnerability lies in the `register-user.php` and `user-meta-property.php` files. The `register-user.php` file handles the user registration process, while `user-meta-property.php` manages user meta updates. The code fails to prevent modification of restricted user meta keys, such as `wp_capabilities`, which controls user roles and permissions. This allows an attacker to register or update user meta to change their capabilities to `super-admin`.\n\n**Affected Software:**\n*   **Plugin:** JetFormBuilder\n*   **Versions:** All versions up to and including 3.3.4.1.\n**Patch:** Update to version 3.3.4.2 or later.",

CWE-863 is a class-level weakness that is related, but less specific. The guidance provided, privileges vs permissions, directed toward CWE-266. There are other related CWEs, but these are not as clearly supported by the evidence.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe266 -->|PEEROF| cwe863\n    cwe863 -->|PEEROF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe266 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe285 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper restriction on user meta fields** (CWE-266), which leads to privilege escalation. An attacker with administrator-level permissions can exploit this to become a super-admin. The chain is:\n1.  **Incorrect Privilege Assignment** (CWE-266) - **ROOT CAUSE**: Due to **improper restriction on user meta fields**.\n2.  Privilege Escalation - IMPACT: An attacker gains super-admin privileges.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **improper restriction on user meta fields**, which is the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The provided information clearly indicates that the plugin **incorrectly** assigns privileges, allowing administrators to escalate their privileges to super-admin.\n\nThe CWE guidance on Privileges vs Permissions clearly points to CWE-266 as the best fit when a user is assigned the wrong role due to misconfiguration or faulty logic. The vulnerability description states that authenticated attackers with administrator-level permissions can register as super-admins, which aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-266. The technical details confirm that the code fails to prevent modification of restricted user meta keys, such as `wp_capabilities`, which directly controls user roles and permissions. This evidence makes a strong case for CWE-266 as the primary CWE.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level for mapping root causes. This level of specificity ensures that the CWE accurately represents the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product **incorrectly assigns** a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 2003.74\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it **does not correctly perform the check**.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1925.84\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform or **incorrectly performs** an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1836.14\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product **does not perform an authorization check** when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate",
