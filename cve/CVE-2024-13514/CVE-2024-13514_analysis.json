The product performs an authorization check, but it does not correctly perform the check. |\n| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate. This is the resulting impact of the vulnerability. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the parent-child relationship between CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and its potential base-level children. However, the description lacks sufficient detail to pinpoint a more specific authorization flaw. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a consequence of the **incorrect authorization**, representing the impact rather than the root cause. The relationship is that CWE-863 can lead to CWE-200.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863), which then leads to the exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized actors (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability described as \"**insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included**.\" The retriever results suggested CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) as potential candidates. However, the description indicates that there are some authorization checks in place, but they are **insufficient**, making CWE-863 a more fitting choice than CWE-862. The **impact** of this **incorrect authorization** is that sensitive information is exposed, which aligns with CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor). However, CWE-200 is the impact and not the root cause. The graph relationships reinforced the understanding that authorization-related CWEs are often at the beginning of a vulnerability chain, leading to various impacts like information exposure. The selection of CWE-863 is at the Class level, as there's not enough information to pinpoint a more specific Base or Variant.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**:
