  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved clk clk-loongson2 Fix **memory corruption** bug in struct loongson2_clk_provider Some heap space is allocated for the flexible structure `struct clk_hw_onecell_data` and its flexible-array member `hws` through the composite structure `struct loongson2_clk_provider` in function `loongson2_clk_probe()`, as shown below 289 struct loongson2_clk_provider *clp ... 296 for (p = data p->name p++) 297 clks_num++ 298 299 clp = devm_kzalloc(dev, struct_size(clp, clk_data.hws, clks_num), 300 GFP_KERNEL) Then some data is written into the flexible array 350 clp->clk_data.hws[p->id] = hw This corrupts `clk_lock`, which is the spinlock variable immediately following the `clk_data` member in `struct loongson2_clk_provider` struct loongson2_clk_provider { void __iomem *base struct device *dev struct clk_hw_onecell_data clk_data spinlock_t clk_lock /* protect access to DIV registers */ } The problem is that the flexible structure is currently placed in the middle of `struct loongson2_clk_provider` instead of at the end. Fix this by moving `struct clk_hw_onecell_data clk_data` to the end of `struct loongson2_clk_provider`. Also, add a code comment to help prevent this from happening again in case new members are added to the structure in the future. This change also fixes the following -Wflex-array-member-not-at-end warning drivers/clk/clk-loongson2.c3236 warning structure containing a flexible array member is not at the end of another structure [-Wflex-array-member-not-at-end]",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe root cause of the vulnerability is a memory corruption issue due to incorrect placement of a flexible array member within a structure. The `struct clk_hw_onecell_data clk_data;` which contains a flexible array `hws` was placed in the middle of the `struct loongson2_clk_provider` structure, rather than at the end. When the code allocated memory and wrote into the flexible array `hws`, it overran the allocated memory for the structure and corrupted adjacent memory, specifically the `clk_lock` spinlock.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Heap-based Buffer Overflow/Memory Corruption:** The primary weakness is a heap-based buffer overflow. Writing to the flexible array `hws` goes beyond the allocated buffer for `clk_data` and overwrites adjacent memory on the heap. This results in memory corruption of the `clk_lock` spinlock, leading to undefined behavior.\n- **Incorrect Structure Layout:** The vulnerability was caused by the incorrect positioning of the flexible array member within the `struct loongson2_clk_provider` structure. Flexible array members should always be at the end of the structure.\n- **-Wflex-array-member-not-at-end Warning:**  The compiler issued a `-Wflex-array-member-not-at-end` warning, which was not addressed previously, indicating a known potential issue in the code.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Spinlock Corruption:** The direct impact is the corruption of the `clk_lock` spinlock.\n- **Undefined Behavior:** The corruption of the spinlock can lead to undefined behavior, which might result in a kernel panic, system instability, or potentially other unexpected consequences.\n- **Potential for Denial of Service:** System instability or kernel panic could lead to a denial-of-service condition.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The vulnerability is triggered during the initialization of the Loongson2 clock provider when the `loongson2_clk_probe()` function allocates memory for the `struct loongson2_clk_provider` and then populates the `clk_data.hws` array.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Local System Access:** An attacker would require the ability to load and initialize the Loongson2 clock driver in the kernel. This typically requires some form of local system access or ability to influence kernel boot parameters.\n- **Driver Initialization:** The attacker would need to trigger the initialization of the clock driver, likely by having the correct hardware present or by using an environment where this driver will be loaded.\n\nIn summary, this vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow due to incorrect structure layout. An attacker with local system access could potentially cause a denial-of-service or system instability by triggering the driver initialization. The fix involves moving the flexible array member to the end of the structure.",

This **incorrect** placement results in a heap buffer overflow when data is written to the `hws` array. The overflow corrupts the `clk_lock` spinlock, leading to undefined behavior and potential denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is caused by a heap-based buffer overflow resulting from an **incorrect** structure layout, where a flexible array member was not placed at the end of the structure.
