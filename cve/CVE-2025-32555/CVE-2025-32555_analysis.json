It provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The document does not specify the exact root cause within the plugin's code, only that it exists.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nA malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nThe attack vector is through Cross-Site Request Forgery.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Unauthenticated attacker.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Remove and replace the software, as it is likely abandoned and will not receive further updates.\n*   Deactivating the software does not remove the threat unless a vPatch is deployed.\n*   Patchstack offers vPatching as a mitigation when no official patch is available.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Affected Software:** SEO, Nutrition and Print for Recipes by Edamam (WordPress Plugin)\n*   **Vulnerable Versions:** <= 3.3\n*   **Fixed Version:** N/A (No official fix available)\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.1 (Low severity)\n*   **OWASP Top 10:** A1: Broken Access Control\n*   **Reported by:** SOPROBRO\n*   **Published by:** Patchstack (April 9, 2025)",

The **lack of CSRF protection** allows an attacker to perform actions on behalf of a user, including injecting malicious scripts that result in XSS. CWE-352 is a compound weakness, indicating that it is a combination of multiple underlying weaknesses.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe352 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of CSRF protection** (CWE-352), which allows an attacker to trick a user into performing actions that inject malicious scripts, leading to Stored XSS (CWE-79).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability and its subsequent impact. The vulnerability description explicitly states the presence of a **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this, stating that the **root cause of the vulnerability** is a \"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).\" This makes CWE-352 the primary weakness.\n\nThe vulnerability also allows Stored XSS. The vulnerability description mentions that the CSRF vulnerability \"allows Stored XSS\". This indicates that the CSRF vulnerability can lead to XSS, as a result of **improper neutralization**. Therefore, CWE-79 is included as a secondary weakness.\n\nThe relationship graph shows that CWE-352 can precede CWE-79. This confirms the vulnerability chain where the **lack of CSRF protection** allows for the injection of malicious scripts, leading to XSS.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-352 is a Compound weakness, which is appropriate given the nature of CSRF as a combination of multiple factors. CWE-79 is a Base weakness, which is also appropriate as it directly relates to the **improper neutralization** of input that leads to XSS.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
