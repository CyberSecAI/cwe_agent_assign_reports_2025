Here's an extraction of relevant information:\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\n\\nThe vulnerability stems from a lack of escaping of various interface messages within the AJAXPoll extension.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n\\n*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n\\nThe vulnerability allows for the injection of XSS payloads when a vulnerable system message (e.g., `ajaxpoll-no-vote-results-after-voting`) is set to malicious content and then rendered within a `<poll>` tag.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n\\n1.  Set a vulnerable system message to an XSS payload.\\n2.  Render a `<poll>` that displays the modified message.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n\\nThe attacker needs the ability to set system messages to arbitrary values.\\n\\n**Mitigation or fix:**\\n\\nThe vulnerability was addressed by escaping various interface messages in the AJAXPoll extension.  The fix was implemented across multiple branches (REL1\\\\_42, REL1\\\\_39, REL1\\\\_43, and master) via Gerrit changes 1130013, 1130014, 1130015, and 1130016. The patch is available as `T389590.patch`.\\n\\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\\n\\n*   The vulnerable code location is identified as `includes/AJAXPoll.php#415` in the AJAXPoll extension.\\n*   The task was initially created by BlankEclair on March 21, 2025, and resolved on March 24, 2025.\\n*   The fix was merged by jenkins-bot.\\n*   The issue is related to task T382326, which involves a release announcement for security patches.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '79', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:Input Validation vulnerability', 'keyphrase': 'Input Validation vulnerability', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'rootcause:Improper Input Validation', 'keyphrase': 'Improper Input Validation', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:Cross-Site Scripting', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:The Wikimedia Foundation Mediawiki - AJAX Poll Extension', 'keyphrase': 'The Wikimedia Foundation Mediawiki - AJAX Poll Extension', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:1.39 through 1.43', 'keyphrase': '1.39 through 1.43', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(185.83913776745084)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:Input Validation vulnerability', 'keyphrase': 'Input Validation vulnerability', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'rootcause:Improper Input Validation', 'keyphrase': 'Improper Input Validation', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:Cross-Site Scripting', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:The Wikimedia Foundation Mediawiki - AJAX Poll Extension', 'keyphrase': 'The Wikimedia Foundation Mediawiki - AJAX Poll Extension', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:1.39 through 1.43', 'keyphrase': '1.39 through 1.43', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(185.14273860128836)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
