# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-3480

## Description

MedDream WEB DICOM Viewer Cleartext Transmission of Credentials **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of MedDream WEB DICOM Viewer. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the Web Portal. The issue results from the **lack of encryption** when transmitting credentials. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose transmitted credentials, leading to further compromise. Was ZDI-CAN-25842.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** lack of encryption
- **Weakness:** Information Disclosure Vulnerability
- **Impact:** ['disclose sensitive information', 'Information Disclosure']
- **Attacker:** network-adjacent attackers
- **Product:** MedDream WEB DICOM Viewer

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability description states "The issue results from the **lack of encryption** when transmitting credentials". |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. The vulnerability results in the disclosure of sensitive information, but CWE-319 is more specific to the root cause. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship considered was the child-parent relationship. CWE-319 is a more specific Base CWE, while CWE-200 is a more general Class CWE. The vulnerability description strongly suggests the **lack of encryption**, making CWE-319 the more appropriate choice.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of encryption** when transmitting credentials (CWE-319), which leads to the exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized actors (CWE-200).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The description clearly states the **lack of encryption** as the root cause, making CWE-319 the most appropriate choice. While the vulnerability does result in information disclosure, mapping solely to CWE-200 would not capture the underlying weakness.

The graph relationships confirm that CWE-319 can lead to CWE-200, further supporting the choice of CWE-319 as the primary weakness.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-319 being a Base CWE that accurately represents the weakness, and CWE-200 being a secondary CWE describing the resulting impact.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Technical Explanation:* The vulnerability description says "**lack of encryption** when transmitting credentials." This is a direct match for the description of CWE-319, where sensitive information is transmitted without encryption.
*Security Implications:* This allows network-adjacent attackers to intercept and read the credentials, leading to account compromise.
*Relationship:* CWE-319 can lead to CWE-200 because **cleartext transmission** of credentials exposes sensitive information.
*Primary/Secondary:* Primary CWE.
*MITRE Mapping Guidance:* The Usage is ALLOWED for CWE-319.

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
