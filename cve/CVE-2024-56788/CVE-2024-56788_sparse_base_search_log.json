  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net ethernet oa_tc6 fix tx skb race condition between reference pointers There are two skb pointers to manage tx skbs enqueued from n/w stack. waiting_tx_skb pointer points to the tx skb which needs to be processed and ongoing_tx_skb pointer points to the tx skb which is being processed. SPI thread prepares the tx data chunks from the tx skb pointed by the ongoing_tx_skb pointer. When the tx skb pointed by the ongoing_tx_skb is processed, the tx skb pointed by the waiting_tx_skb is assigned to ongoing_tx_skb and the waiting_tx_skb pointer is assigned with NULL. Whenever there is a new tx skb from n/w stack, it will be assigned to waiting_tx_skb pointer if it is NULL. Enqueuing and processing of a tx skb handled in two different threads. Consider a scenario where the SPI thread processed an ongoing_tx_skb and it moves next tx skb from waiting_tx_skb pointer to ongoing_tx_skb pointer without doing any NULL check. At this time, if the waiting_tx_skb pointer is NULL then ongoing_tx_skb pointer is also assigned with NULL. After that, if a new tx skb is assigned to waiting_tx_skb pointer by the n/w stack and there is a chance to overwrite the tx skb pointer with NULL in the SPI thread. Finally one of the tx skb will be left as unhandled, resulting packet missing and memory leak. - Consider the below scenario where the TXC reported from the previous transfer is 10 and ongoing_tx_skb holds an tx ethernet frame which can be transported in 20 TXCs and waiting_tx_skb is still NULL. tx_credits = 10 /* 21 are filled in the previous transfer */ ongoing_tx_skb = 20 waiting_tx_skb = NULL /* Still NULL */ - So, (tc6->ongoing_tx_skb || tc6->waiting_tx_skb) becomes true. - After oa_tc6_prepare_spi_tx_buf_for_tx_skbs() ongoing_tx_skb = 10 waiting_tx_skb = NULL /* Still NULL */ - Perform SPI transfer. - Process SPI rx buffer to get the TXC from footers. - Now lets assume previously filled 21 TXCs are freed so we are good to transport the next remaining 10 tx chunks from ongoing_tx_skb. tx_credits = 21 ongoing_tx_skb = 10 waiting_tx_skb = NULL - So, (tc6->ongoing_tx_skb || tc6->waiting_tx_skb) becomes true again. - In the oa_tc6_prepare_spi_tx_buf_for_tx_skbs() ongoing_tx_skb = NULL waiting_tx_skb = NULL - Now the below bad case might happen, Thread1 (oa_tc6_start_xmit) Thread2 (oa_tc6_spi_thread_handler) --------------------------- ----------------------------------- - if waiting_tx_skb is NULL - if ongoing_tx_skb is NULL - ongoing_tx_skb = waiting_tx_skb - waiting_tx_skb = skb - waiting_tx_skb = NULL ... - ongoing_tx_skb = NULL - if waiting_tx_skb is NULL - waiting_tx_skb = skb To overcome the above issue, protect the moving of tx skb reference from waiting_tx_skb pointer to ongoing_tx_skb pointer and assigning new tx skb to waiting_tx_skb pointer, so that the other thread cant access the waiting_tx_skb pointer until the current thread completes moving the tx skb reference safely.",
