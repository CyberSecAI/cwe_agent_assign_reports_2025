  "description": "Netty QUIC codec is a QUIC codec for netty which makes use of quiche. An issue was discovered in the codec. A **hash collision vulnerability** (in the hash map used to manage connections) allows remote attackers to cause a considerable CPU load on the server (a Hash DoS attack) by initiating connections with colliding Source Connection IDs (SCIDs). This vulnerability is fixed in 0.0.71.Final.",

This allows attackers to cause hash collisions.\n    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Hash collision vulnerability.\n    *   **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can cause a significant CPU load on the server (a Hash DoS attack) by initiating connections with colliding Source Connection IDs (SCIDs), potentially slowing the server by a factor of 300.\n    *   **Attack vectors:** Initiating connections with colliding Source Connection IDs (SCIDs).\n    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remote attacker. The attacker needs to be able to send QUIC packets. The attacker can freely choose CIDs (connection IDs) and cause collisions under the target hash function used by a vulnerable server.\n    *   **Mitigation or fix:** The commit implements a custom hash map that uses SipHash to prevent hash collisions.\n\n**3.

The allocation of resources without limits or throttling (CWE-770) further exacerbates the problem, ultimately resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The root cause is the **weak hash** and the impact is CPU exhaustion due to uncontrolled resource consumption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis focuses on the **hash collision vulnerability** in Netty QUIC codec that can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. The primary CWE selected is CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption), as the core issue is the server's inability to handle a flood of connections, leading to CPU exhaustion. This is supported by the vulnerability description, which states that attackers can cause \"considerable CPU load on the server.\"\n\nCWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity) is considered a secondary CWE because the **hash collision** is a manifestation of algorithmic inefficiency.\n\nCWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is another candidate because the vulnerability involves the server allocating resources for new connections without proper limitations, exacerbating the impact of the **hash collision**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-400 as primary is based on the overall impact of the vulnerability, which is resource exhaustion leading to DoS. While the **hash collision** (CWE-407) is the trigger, the resulting uncontrolled consumption of CPU resources is the primary manifestation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
