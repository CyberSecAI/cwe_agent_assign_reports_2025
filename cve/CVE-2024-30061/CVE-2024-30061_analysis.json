The retriever results suggested more specific options like CWE-497 and CWE-532. However, due to the limited information in the vulnerability description, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact mechanism of information exposure. Therefore, while less specific, CWE-200 is a reasonable starting point.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    \n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe497,cwe532 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively simple:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** An unspecified **weakness** leading to **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**.\n2.  **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information.\n\nDue to the lack of detail, the exact root cause remains unclear.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary challenge in this analysis is the lack of detailed information about the vulnerability. The description only mentions an **\"Information Disclosure Vulnerability\"** in Microsoft Dynamics 365 (On-Premises). The retriever results offer potential CWEs related to information exposure, with CWE-200 as the top match.\n\nGiven the limited evidence, CWE-200 is selected as the primary CWE. While it is a Class-level CWE and the mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific options exist, the absence of details about the exposure mechanism prevents selecting a more precise CWE. The vulnerability description key phrases and CVE reference links do not offer any more information about the rootcause. CWE-497 and CWE-532 are considered as secondary candidates due to their higher relevance scores and Base level of abstraction.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available.

  "analysis_with_relationships": "# Summary\n| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **CWE-200** | **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** | 0.8 | Class | Primary CWE | Discouraged |\n| CWE-497 | Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere | 0.6 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |\n| CWE-532 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File | 0.4 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** LOW\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship impacting the decision is that CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE, and several more specific Base-level CWEs exist that fall under it (ChildOf). The retriever results suggested more specific options like CWE-497 and CWE-532. However, due to the limited information in the vulnerability description, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact mechanism of information exposure. Therefore, while less specific, CWE-200 is a reasonable starting point.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    \n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe497,cwe532 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively simple:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** An unspecified **weakness** leading to **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**.\n2.  **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information.\n\nDue to the lack of detail, the exact root cause remains unclear.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary challenge in this analysis is the lack of detailed information about the vulnerability. The description only mentions an **\"Information Disclosure Vulnerability\"** in Microsoft Dynamics 365 (On-Premises). The retriever results offer potential CWEs related to information exposure, with CWE-200 as the top match.\n\nGiven the limited evidence, CWE-200 is selected as the primary CWE. While it is a Class-level CWE and the mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific options exist, the absence of details about the exposure mechanism prevents selecting a more precise CWE. The vulnerability description key phrases and CVE reference links do not offer any more information about the rootcause. CWE-497 and CWE-532 are considered as secondary candidates due to their higher relevance scores and Base level of abstraction.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
