  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Nothings stb up to f056911. It has been classified as problematic. Affected is the function stbhw_build_tileset_from_image of the component Header Array Handler. The manipulation of the argument w leads to **out-of-bounds read**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. This product is using a rolling release to provide continious delivery. Therefore, no version details for affected nor updated releases are available. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

While other CWEs were considered, none had the same level of direct applicability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe125 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single step: an **out-of-bounds read** due to manipulation of the argument 'w' in the `stbhw_build_tileset_from_image` function. The root cause is the **improper** handling or validation of the 'w' argument, leading directly to the read.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the manipulation of the argument 'w' leads to an **out-of-bounds read**. This directly corresponds to CWE-125, \"Out-of-bounds Read\". The description states: \"Affected is the function stbhw_build_tileset_from_image of the component Header Array Handler. The manipulation of the argument w leads to **out-of-bounds read**.\" The retriever results also list CWE-125 as the top candidate.\n\nThe other CWEs were considered but are less directly applicable:\n*   CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')): Not applicable because the vulnerability is not related to web page generation or cross-site scripting.\n*   CWE-191 (Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)) and CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound): While integer issues could potentially be related to the buffer access, the description specifically mentions an **out-of-bounds read**, making CWE-125 a more precise match.\n*   CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input): While this could be a contributing factor, the direct result is the read beyond buffer boundaries, thus CWE-125 is more relevant.\n*   CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write): While related to out-of-bounds access, the description explicitly states an **out-of-bounds read**, not a write.\n*   CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource): There's no mention of uninitialized resources.\n\nThe selection of CWE-125 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly describes the observed vulnerability.",
