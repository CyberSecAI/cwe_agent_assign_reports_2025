CWE-321 and CWE-1204 are related because the use of a hard-coded cryptographic key and a weak IV contribute to the overall weakness of the encryption. The relationship is hierarchical, with CWE-321 being a variant of CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials).

The use of a hard-coded key (CWE-321) and a weak IV (CWE-1204) exacerbate the issue.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **cleartext transmission of sensitive information** (CWE-319), which is the root cause of the vulnerability. The use of a hard-coded key (CWE-321) and a weak IV (CWE-1204) contribute to the overall weakness but are not the primary cause. The selection of CWE-319 is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly states that the AES key is sent in cleartext. The graph relationships helped identify related weaknesses, such as CWE-321 and CWE-1204, which are secondary candidates. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they accurately represent the weaknesses described in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n**CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information**\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors. The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**The AES key in sent in cleartext in response to successful authentication**\"\n\n**CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key**\nThe product uses a cryptographic key that is hard-coded, which can be easily obtained by an attacker. While not explicitly stated, the context suggests that the symmetric AES key is hard-coded.\n\n**CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)**\nThe product uses a weak initialization vector (IV) for encryption, which can make it easier for an attacker to decrypt the data. The vulnerability description states \"**The IV is always EU5H62G9ICGRNI43**.\"\n\nCWEs Considered but Not Used:\n\n*   CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data - While related, the vulnerability description specifies that encryption *is* used, but the key is transmitted in cleartext, making CWE-319 a more accurate fit.\n*   CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute - While relevant to the transmission of sensitive information, it specifically relates to cookies. This vulnerability is about the encryption key itself.\n*   CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm - This is a class-level CWE and less specific than other candidates.\n*   CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials - This is a class-level CWE and does not directly address the transmission of sensitive information in cleartext.\n*   CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay - This is not directly applicable, as the vulnerability is not about bypassing authentication.\n*   CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information - This is not applicable, as the vulnerability is about transmission, not storage.\n*   CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter - This is not applicable, as the vulnerability is not about externally controlled parameters.\n*   CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization - Not related since the issue is not related to authorization, but rather the transmission of a key.\n*   CWE-285: Improper Authorization - Not related since the issue is not related to authorization, but rather the transmission of a key.\n*   CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function - Authentication exists in this case.\n*   CWE-1390: Weak Authentication - The authentication is not the main issue, it is what happens after authentication.",
