## Vulnerability Description
The Verowa Connect plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the search_string parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.1 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

### CVE-2024-11460

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization and escaping of the `search_string` parameter within the Verowa Connect plugin for WordPress, leading to an SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the `search_string` parameter, received via the `$_GET` method, lacks proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- Lack of Prepared Statements: The existing SQL queries are not sufficiently prepared, which further facilitates SQL injection attacks by allowing attackers to append additional SQL queries into existing queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
- Extract sensitive information from the database.
- Potentially modify data, although the provided information explicitly mentions that only reading data is possible through this vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- Unauthenticated attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted GET request with a malicious payload in the `search_string` parameter.
- The vulnerability is present in the `/verowa/v1/agenda_event` REST API endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any authentication or specific privileges. They can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- The attacker requires knowledge of the vulnerable parameter and the REST endpoint to inject the SQL payload.
