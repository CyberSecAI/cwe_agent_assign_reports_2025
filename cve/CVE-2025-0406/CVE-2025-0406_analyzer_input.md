## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-0406 Content

Based on the provided content, this relates to a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `subname` parameter value passed to the `count` method in `src/main/java/com/liujian/gymxmjpa/controller/SubjectController.java` was not filtered.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

The content does not explicitly state the impact, but SQL injection can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, and potentially complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**

The attacker can craft malicious SQL queries through the `subname` parameter in the `count` method. The provided examples demonstrate using techniques like:

*   `' and length(database())=3 and '1'='1` to determine the database length.
*   `' and substr(database(),1,1) ='g` to extract the first character of the database name.
*   `' and substr(database(),2,1) ='y` to extract the second character of the database name.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint (`/subject/count`) and analyze the responses to extract information. No authentication is required based on the provided examples.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not provide specific mitigation steps, but proper input validation and parameterized queries (prepared statements) should be implemented to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Note:** This content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including specific examples of exploitation attempts and the database name being "gym".
