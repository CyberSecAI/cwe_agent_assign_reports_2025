In this scenario addr_to_vb_xa() hash function can return an index which accesses to not-possible and not setup CPU area using per_cpu() macro. This results in an oops on SPARC. A per-cpu vmap_block_queue is also used as hash table, incorrectly assuming the cpu_possible_mask has no gaps. Fix it by adjusting an index to a next possible CPU.
