  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2025-31672', description='Improper **Input Validation vulnerability** in Apache POI. The issue affects the parsing of OOXML format files like xlsx, docx and pptx. These file formats are basically zip files and it is possible for malicious users to add zip entries with duplicate names (including the path) in the zip. In this case, products reading the affected file could read different data because 1 of the zip entries with the duplicate name is selected over another but different products may choose a different zip entry. This issue affects Apache POI poi-ooxml before 5.4.0. poi-ooxml 5.4.0 has a check that throws an exception if zip entries with duplicate file names are found in the input file. Users are recommended to upgrade to version poi-ooxml 5.4.0, which fixes the issue. Please read https//poi.apache.org/security.html for recommendations about how to use the POI libraries securely.', key_phrases={'rootcause': ['Input Validation vulnerability', 'improper input validation'], 'weakness': '', 'impact': ['read different zip entry', 'read different data'], 'vector': 'zip entries with duplicate names', 'attacker': 'malicious users', 'product': 'Apache POI poi-ooxml', 'version': 'before 5.4.0', 'component': ''}, reference_content='## CVE-2025-31672: Apache POI - Improper Input Validation\\n\\n**Based on the provided content, this CVE is relevant.**\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\n\\nThe vulnerability stems from the possibility of adding zip entries with duplicate names within OOXML-based files (xlsx, docx, pptx). These file formats are essentially zip files.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n\\n*   Improper input validation when parsing OOXML files.\\n*   The ability to include duplicate zip entry names within the zip archive structure of OOXML files.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n\\nProducts reading the affected file could read unexpected or incorrect data because the selection of which zip entry with the duplicate name to use can vary between products.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n\\n*   A malicious user can craft a specially designed OOXML file with duplicate zip entry names.\\n*   The crafted file is then opened by a vulnerable application using Apache POI.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n\\n*   The attacker needs to be able to create and deliver a malicious OOXML file to a user who is using a vulnerable application.\\n\\n**Mitigation or fix:**\\n\\n*   Upgrade to Apache POI version 5.4.0 or later. This version includes a check that throws an exception if duplicate zip entry names are found, preventing the issue.\\n*   Follow the security guidelines provided at [https://poi.apache.org/security.html](https://poi.apache.org/security.html) for secure usage of the POI libraries.\\n\\n**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**\\n\\n*   The vulnerability affects the `poi-ooxml` component of Apache POI.\\n*   The issue is tracked as bug-69620 in the Apache Bugzilla system

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    Improper **Input Validation vulnerability** in Apache POI. The issue affects the parsing of OOXML format files like xlsx, docx and pptx. These file formats are basically zip files and it is possible for malicious users to add zip entries with duplicate names (including the path) in the zip. In this case, products reading the affected file could read different data because 1 of the zip entries with the duplicate name is selected over another but different products may choose a different zip entry. This issue affects Apache POI poi-ooxml before 5.4.0. poi-ooxml 5.4.0 has a check that throws an exception if zip entries with duplicate file names are found in the input file. Users are recommended to upgrade to version poi-ooxml 5.4.0, which fixes the issue. Please read https//poi.apache.org/security.html for recommendations about how to use the POI libraries securely.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'Input Validation vulnerability'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
