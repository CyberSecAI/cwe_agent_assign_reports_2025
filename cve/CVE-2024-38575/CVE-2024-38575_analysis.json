  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi brcmfmac pcie handle randbuf allocation failure The kzalloc() in brcmf_pcie_download_fw_nvram() will return null if the physical memory has run out. As a result, if we use get_random_bytes() to generate random bytes in the randbuf, the **null pointer dereference** bug will happen. In order to prevent allocation failure, this patch adds a separate function using buffer on kernel stack to generate random bytes in the randbuf, which could prevent the kernel stack from **overflow**.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe root cause of the vulnerability is a potential null pointer dereference in the `brcmf_pcie_download_fw_nvram` function within the `brcmfmac` driver. Specifically, the function allocates memory for a random buffer (`randbuf`) using `kzalloc`. If `kzalloc` fails (due to memory exhaustion), it returns `NULL`. Subsequently, the code attempts to use `get_random_bytes` with this possibly null pointer, leading to a crash.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is the dereference of a null pointer. If `kzalloc` fails to allocate memory, the `randbuf` pointer will be `NULL`. The subsequent call to `get_random_bytes(randbuf, rand_len)` will result in a null pointer dereference and a kernel crash.\n*   **Lack of Error Handling:** The original code lacked proper error handling after `kzalloc`. It did not check if the allocation was successful before proceeding to use the allocated memory.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Kernel Crash:** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a kernel crash due to the null pointer dereference, leading to a denial-of-service.\n*   **System Instability:** A kernel crash can lead to system instability and unexpected downtime.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Memory Exhaustion:** An attacker could potentially trigger this vulnerability by causing memory exhaustion on the system, forcing `kzalloc` to fail, leading to the null pointer dereference. This can occur due to various activities that consume system memory.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Ability to Cause Memory Pressure:** An attacker needs to be able to cause sufficient memory pressure on the system to trigger the `kzalloc` failure. This might involve running resource-intensive processes or exploiting other memory-related vulnerabilities.\n*   **Local/Remote Access:** It is not specified if this is triggerable locally or remotely, but given it is a memory allocation issue, it is likely local with a privileged user that has the ability to exhaust memory.\n\n**Mitigation:**\n\nThe provided patch fixes the vulnerability by replacing the dynamic allocation with a stack allocated buffer using a new helper function called `brcmf_pcie_provide_random_bytes`. Instead of using `kzalloc`, a fixed-size buffer `randbuf` is allocated on the stack, thus avoiding the possibility of allocation failure and a null pointer dereference.\nThe patch includes the following changes:\n\n*   A new function `brcmf_pcie_provide_random_bytes` is introduced, allocating `randbuf` on the stack.\n*   The `get_random_bytes` and `memcpy_toio` calls are moved into the new function using the stack allocated buffer.\n*   The dynamic allocation using `kzalloc`, the null check, and the `kfree` call were removed.\n\nThis ensures that even under memory pressure, the random bytes are generated without a risk of a null pointer dereference.",
