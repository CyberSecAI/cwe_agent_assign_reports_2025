## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in za-internet C-MOR Video Surveillance 5.2401 and 6.00PL01. Due to **insufficient input validation**, the C-MOR web interface is vulnerable to **OS command injection** attacks. It was found out that different functionality is vulnerable to **OS command injection** attacks, for example for generating new X.509 certificates, or setting the time zone. These **OS command injection** vulnerabilities in the script generatesslreq.pml can be exploited as a low-privileged authenticated user to execute commands in the context of the Linux user www-data via shell metacharacters in HTTP POST data (e.g., the city parameter). The **OS command injection** vulnerability in the script settimezone.pml or setdatetime.pml (e.g., via the year parameter) requires an administrative user for the C-MOR web interface. By also exploiting a privilege-escalation vulnerability, it is possible to execute commands on the C-MOR system with root privileges.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient input validation**
- **weakness:** **OS command injection**
- **impact:** execute commands
- **vector:** shell metacharacters in HTTP POST data
- **attacker:** low-privileged authenticated user
- **product:** za-internet C-MOR Video Surveillance
- **version:** 5.2401 and 6.00PL01
- **component:** generatesslreq.pml and settimezone.pml and setdatetime.pml

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Insufficient input validation in the C-MOR web interface allows for OS command injection. Specifically, user-supplied data is not properly sanitized before being used in system calls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):**  The primary vulnerability is that arbitrary operating system commands can be executed through vulnerable web interface scripts. Two scripts are specifically mentioned:
    *   `generatesslreq.pml`: Vulnerable to command injection via the `city` parameter. This script is related to generating X.509 certificates.
    *   `settimezone.pml`: Vulnerable to command injection when setting the time zone.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying system.
*   **Web Shell Upload:** An attacker can upload a web shell, allowing for persistent access and further compromise of the system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** When combined with other vulnerabilities (SYSS-2024-027), the attacker can gain root privileges on the C-MOR system.
*   **System Compromise:** Attackers can potentially gain full control of the C-MOR system, leading to data breaches, surveillance manipulation, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Requests:** Attackers send crafted HTTP POST requests to vulnerable scripts.
*   **Parameter Injection:** Malicious commands are injected via parameters such as `city` in `generatesslreq.pml` and date/time parameters in `settimezone.pml`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User (Low-Privileged):** For `generatesslreq.pml`, a low-privileged authenticated user is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability. This indicates the vulnerability is accessible to standard users.
*   **Administrative User:** For `settimezone.pml`, an administrative user is required. However, this can be combined with the privilege escalation vulnerability to gain root access.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the C-MOR web interface.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in C-MOR Video Surveillance versions 5.2401 and 6.00PL01.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is not included in the software version 6.00PL01.
*   The vulnerability in `generatesslreq.pml` allows execution as the `www-data` user by default, while the `settimezone.pml` attack can escalate privileges to root by exploiting another vulnerability
*   The provided PoC demonstrates how to create a PHP web shell using the vulnerability in `generatesslreq.pml` and execute commands with `settimezone.pml`

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**
