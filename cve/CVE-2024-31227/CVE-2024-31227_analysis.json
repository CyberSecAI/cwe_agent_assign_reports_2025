An authenticated with sufficient privileges may create a **malformed ACL selector** which, when accessed, triggers a server panic and subsequent denial of service. The problem exists in Redis 7 prior to versions 7.2.6 and 7.4.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "The content is related to CVE-2024-31227.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:** A malformed ACL selector can cause a server panic. The issue lies in the parsing logic of the ACL selector where it does not handle certain invalid combinations of read/write permissions properly. Specifically, the code was not properly validating that a '%' rule contains at least one of the R (read) or W (write) permissions.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Improper input validation when creating ACL selectors.\n- Lack of checks for correct permission usage within the selector string.\n- Insufficient error handling, leading to a server panic when a malformed selector is accessed.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Denial of service (DoS) due to server panic.\n- Server becomes unavailable, disrupting services relying on it.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Maliciously crafted ACL selector via `ACL SETUSER` command.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- Authenticated user with sufficient privileges to create ACL selectors.\n- The attacker needs to be able to connect to the Redis server and execute commands.",

While the vulnerability involves an authorization issue due to a **malformed ACL selector**, the specific type of authorization failure isn't detailed enough to choose a more specific child of CWE-285. I considered CWE-863, which is a sibling of CWE-285, and chose it because it better represents the situation where an authorization check exists, but is performed incorrectly.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe754[\"CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe754 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **malformed ACL selector** which leads to a server panic, ultimately resulting in a denial of service.\n\n`Malformed ACL Selector` -> `Incorrect Authorization` -> `Server Panic` -> `Denial of Service`\n\nThe root cause is the **improper** handling of the **malformed ACL selector** during authorization, which triggers the server panic.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed towards authorization-related CWEs due to the involvement of ACL selectors and privileges. After reviewing the vulnerability description and the CVE reference content, it became clear that the **incorrect authorization** was the core issue. The system allows the creation of a **malformed ACL selector**, which then leads to a server panic.\n\nThe selection of CWE-863 is based on the fact that the system does perform an authorization check but it does not correctly perform the check.
