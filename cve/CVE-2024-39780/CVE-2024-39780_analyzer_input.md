# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-39780

## Vulnerability Description
A **YAML deserialization** vulnerability was found in the Robot Operating System (ROS) dynparam, a command-line tool for getting, setting, and deleting parameters of a dynamically configurable node, affecting ROS distributions Noetic and earlier. The issue is caused by the use of the yaml.load() function in the set and get verbs, and allows for the creation of arbitrary Python objects. Through this flaw, a local or remote user can craft and execute arbitrary Python code.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **weakness:** **YAML deserialization**
- **impact:** execute arbitrary Python code
- **attacker:** local or remote user
- **product:** Robot Operating System (ROS)
- **version:** Noetic and earlier
