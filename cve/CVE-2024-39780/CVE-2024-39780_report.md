# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-39780

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-39780

## Description

A **YAML deserialization** vulnerability was found in the Robot Operating System (ROS) dynparam, a command-line tool for getting, setting, and deleting parameters of a dynamically configurable node, affecting ROS distributions Noetic and earlier. The issue is caused by the use of the yaml.load() function in the set and get verbs, and allows for the creation of arbitrary Python objects. Through this flaw, a local or remote user can craft and execute arbitrary Python code.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** use of yaml.load() function
- **Weakness:** YAML deserialization
- **Impact:** execute arbitrary Python code
- **Attacker:** local or remote user
- **Product:** Robot Operating System (ROS)
- **Version:** Noetic and earlier
- **Component:** dynparam tool

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-502 | Deserialization of Untrusted Data | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-94 | Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') | 0.7 | Base | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is that CWE-502 **Deserialization of Untrusted Data** can lead to CWE-94 **Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')**. Deserialization vulnerabilities often result in the ability to inject and execute arbitrary code. CWE-502 is the root cause, and CWE-94 is a potential consequence. The abstraction levels are both Base, representing specific weaknesses.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **use of yaml.load() function** which leads to **YAML deserialization**, and then the ability to **execute arbitrary Python code**.
  - **Root Cause:** CWE-502 **Deserialization of Untrusted Data** due to use of `yaml.load()`
  - **Impact:** CWE-94 **Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')** allowing arbitrary code execution

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary.

The core issue is the **use of yaml.load() function** which is known to be unsafe and can lead to arbitrary code execution. The fix replaces `yaml.load` with `yaml.safe_load`.

The primary CWE is CWE-502 **Deserialization of Untrusted Data**. The use of `yaml.load()` without proper validation of the deserialized data allows an attacker to craft malicious YAML payloads that can lead to arbitrary code execution.

CWE-94 **Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')** is a secondary candidate because the impact of the vulnerability is the execution of arbitrary code. However, it is a consequence of the deserialization, not the root cause.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly represent the root cause and the immediate impact of the vulnerability. CWE-502 accurately describes the **deserialization** issue, and CWE-94 describes the resulting **code injection**.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:

**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:

The product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component
in another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the
intended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.

**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.
