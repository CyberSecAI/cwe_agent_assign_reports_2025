- **vector:** manipulation of course_code argument
- **product:** 1000 Projects Attendance Tracking Management System
- **version:** 1.0
- **component:** /admin/course_action.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12899

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection located in the `/admin/course_action.php` file of the "Attendance Tracking Management System PHP & MySQL Project"
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied input, specifically the `course_code` parameter before it is used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates the `course_code` parameter into SQL queries without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data.
- **Comprehensive System Control:** In severe cases, attackers may gain full control of the system, potentially leading to service interruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `course_code` parameter in a POST request to `/admin/course_action.php`.
- No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.
- No prior authentication or special privileges are required.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable File:** `/admin/course_action.php`
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** `course_code` (POST parameter)
- **Vulnerability Type:** boolean-based blind and time-based blind SQL injection.
- **Example Payloads:**
    - **Boolean-based blind:** `course_code=-7876" OR 5404=5404-- tZiD`
    - **Time-based blind:** `course_code=SE 101" AND (SELECT 7675 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))nIPp)-- aLbB`

**Suggested Repair:**
1.  **Use Prepared Statements and Parameter Binding:** Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection by separating SQL code from user input.
2.  **Input Validation and Filtering:** Strictly validate and filter user input data.
3.  **Minimize Database User Permissions:** Use database accounts with minimal necessary privileges.
4.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.

This detailed breakdown should provide a comprehensive understanding of the SQL injection vulnerability described.
