  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-3173 Content\n\nThis content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it's a report *about* a vulnerability, not the official CVE description itself. It provides more detail than a typical CVE description would.\n\nHere's the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/save_booking.php` file of the 'Time Table Generator' project.\n*   The root cause is the direct use of the `lawyer_id` parameter in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering\n*   Comprehensive system control\n*   Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The `lawyer_id` parameter in a POST request to `/save_booking.php` is vulnerable.\n*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.\n*   Knowledge of SQL injection techniques and payloads is necessary.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.\n2.  **Input validation and filtering:**  Ensure user input conforms to the expected format.\n3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the minimum necessary permissions.\n4.  **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Affected Product:** Time Table Generator System using PHP and MySQL\n*   **Vendor Homepage:** <https://phpgurukul.com/time-table-generator-system-using-php-and-mysql/>\n*   **Vulnerable File:** `/save_booking.php`\n*   **Version:** V1.0\n*   **Software Link:** <https://phpgurukul.com/?sdm_process_download=1&download_id=20293>\n*   **Payload Examples:** The report includes several SQLmap payloads for boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind SQL injection attacks.\n*   **POC:** A screenshot of a SQLmap scan is provided.",

There are no clear parent-child or chain relationships evident in the provided information that would suggest a more specific or related CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively simple:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')** (CWE-89) due to direct use of the `lawyer_id` parameter in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.\n2.  **Impact:** Unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, service interruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states that the vulnerability is an **sql injection** in the `/save_booking.php` file, affecting the `lawyer_id/description` argument. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating that the root cause is the direct use of the `lawyer_id` parameter in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation. The report also suggests using prepared statements and input validation as mitigation techniques, which are standard practices for preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Retriever Results also lists CWE-89 as the top candidate.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence provided, CWE-89 is the most appropriate mapping.
