# Retrieval Query for CVE-2024-52509

## Vulnerability Description
Nextcloud Mail is the mail app for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. The Nextcloud mail app incorrectly allowed attaching shared files without download permissions as attachments. This allowed users to send them the files to themselves and then downloading it from their mail clients. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Mail is upgraded to 2.2.10, 3.6.2 or 3.7.2.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **users can send shared files to themselves without download permissions**
- **product:** Nextcloud Mail

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-52509:

**1. Verification:**
The provided content directly relates to CVE-2024-52509. The GitHub security advisory for `GHSA-pwpp-fvcr-w862` explicitly mentions `CVE-2024-52509` and describes the vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the Nextcloud Mail app's failure to properly check download permissions when attaching shared files. It allows users to attach files to emails even if they do not have the permission to download them directly.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Access Control:** The mail app doesn't enforce the download permissions associated with shared files when creating attachments.
- **Data Leakage:** Shared files without download permissions can be attached to emails and then downloaded from the email client by the user, bypassing the intended access restrictions.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Unauthorized users with "read-only" share access can bypass the "no-download" restriction by emailing the content to themselves and then downloading the file from their email client. This leads to unintended access and exposure of confidential data.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable via the network, as users interact with the Nextcloud instance through a web browser or email client.
- **File Sharing:** The attack requires a user to have access to a shared file within Nextcloud, which does not grant download permissions to them.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs a user account on the affected Nextcloud instance.
- **Read-only Share Access:** The attacker needs access to a file that was shared with them with no download permissions.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to use the mail application to attach the shared file and send the email to themselves.

**Technical Details:**

- The fix involves checking for download permissions in the `AttachmentService.php` file. The `hasDownloadPermissions` function is added to verify whether the user has download access before allowing a shared file as an attachment.
- The `AttachmentServiceTest.php` file was updated to include a test case that specifically checks the `handleAttachmentsCloudAttachmentNoDownloadPermission` function, ensuring that files without download permission are not attached.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by rullzer via HackerOne.
- The fix was implemented in pull request #9592 in the nextcloud/mail repository.
- The vulnerability impacts versions >= 2.2.0, >= 3.6.0 and >= 3.7.0 of the Nextcloud Mail app.
- Patched versions include 2.2.10, 3.6.2, and 3.7.2.
- The CVSS score is 3.5, with a low severity rating.
- The CWE is CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

### Extended Description


Retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.


For example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.


One manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.


### Alternative Terms
Insecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The "Insecure Direct Object Reference" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.
Broken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.
Horizontal Authorization: "Horizontal Authorization" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.

## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.

### Extended Description


The sensitive information may be valuable information on its own (such as a password), or it may be useful for launching other, more serious attacks. The error message may be created in different ways:


  - self-generated: the source code explicitly constructs the error message and delivers it

  - externally-generated: the external environment, such as a language interpreter, handles the error and constructs its own message, whose contents are not under direct control by the programmer

An attacker may use the contents of error messages to help launch another, more focused attack. For example, an attempt to exploit a path traversal weakness (CWE-22) might yield the full pathname of the installed application. In turn, this could be used to select the proper number of ".." sequences to navigate to the targeted file. An attack using SQL injection (CWE-89) might not initially succeed, but an error message could reveal the malformed query, which would expose query logic and possibly even passwords or other sensitive information used within the query.

- **CVE-2007-5172:** Program reveals password in error message if attacker can trigger certain database errors.
- **CVE-2008-4638:** Composite: application running with high privileges (CWE-250) allows user to specify a restricted file to process, which generates a parsing error that leaks the contents of the file (CWE-209).




## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

### Extended Description


This could allow an attacker to access or modify system files or other files that are critical to the application.


Path manipulation errors occur when the following two conditions are met:

```
		1. An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.
		2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.
```
For example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** CWE-114 is a Class, but it is listed a child of CWE-73 in view 1000. This suggests some abstraction problems that should be resolved in future versions.

**[Relationship]** 

The external control of filenames can be the primary link in chains with other file-related weaknesses, as seen in the CanPrecede relationships. This is because software systems use files for many different purposes: to execute programs, load code libraries, to store application data, to store configuration settings, record temporary data, act as signals or semaphores to other processes, etc.


However, those weaknesses do not always require external control. For example, link-following weaknesses (CWE-59) often involve pathnames that are not controllable by the attacker at all.


The external control can be resultant from other issues. For example, in PHP applications, the register_globals setting can allow an attacker to modify variables that the programmer thought were immutable, enabling file inclusion (CWE-98) and path traversal (CWE-22). Operating with excessive privileges (CWE-250) might allow an attacker to specify an input filename that is not directly readable by the attacker, but is accessible to the privileged program. A buffer overflow (CWE-119) might give an attacker control over nearby memory locations that are related to pathnames, but were not directly modifiable by the attacker.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using "../" sequences (CWE-24)
- **CVE-2008-5748:** Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.
- **CVE-2008-5764:** Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.




## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.

### Extended Description


Attackers might be able to spoof the intended endpoint from a different system or process, thus gaining the same level of access as the intended endpoint.


While this issue frequently involves authentication between network-based clients and servers, other types of communication channels and endpoints can have this weakness.

- **CVE-2022-4390:** A WAN interface on a router has firewall restrictions enabled for IPv4, but it does not for IPv6, which is enabled by default




## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

### Extended Description
This allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.

### Alternative Terms
Zip Slip: "Zip slip" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).
