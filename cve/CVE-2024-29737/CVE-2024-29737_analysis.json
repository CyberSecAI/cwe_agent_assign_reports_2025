  "description": "In streampark, the project module integrates Mavens compilation capabilities. The input parameter validation is not strict, allowing attackers to insert commands for remote command execution, The prerequisite for a successful attack is that the user needs to log in to the streampark system and have system-level permissions. Generally, only users of that system have the authorization to log in, and users would not manually input a dangerous operation command. Therefore, the risk level of this vulnerability is very low. Mitigation all users should upgrade to 2.1.4 Background info Log in to Streampark using the default username (e.g. test1, test2, test3) and the **default password** (streampark). Navigate to the Project module, then add a new project. Enter the git repository address of the project and input `touch /tmp/success_2.1.2` as the Build Argument. Note that there is no verification and interception of the special character `. As a result, you will find that this injection command will be successfully executed after executing the build. In the latest version, the special symbol ` is intercepted.",

CWE-78 is a more specific case of CWE-74, focusing on OS command injection. The vulnerability description clearly indicates the injection occurs within an OS command, making CWE-78 the more appropriate choice. CWE-88 is also a child of CWE-74 and represents argument injection, which is similar but the focus is less on argument delimiters. CWE-201 is related to sensitive data exposure, and may be related as the injected commands could expose system data.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe88[\"CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe88 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe88,cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation**, leading to **command injection**, and ultimately resulting in **command execution**. The **improper input validation** allows an attacker to insert arbitrary commands into the build arguments, which are then executed by the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE identified is CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')). This is because the vulnerability description explicitly states that attackers can insert commands into the build arguments, leading to command execution. The phrase \"input `touch /tmp/success_2.1.2` as the Build Argument\" is key evidence. This directly aligns with the description of CWE-78, which involves constructing an OS command using externally influenced input without proper neutralization.\n\nCWE-88 (Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')) is considered as a secondary CWE. While the vulnerability involves injecting commands, the focus is less on argument delimiters and more on the overall command being injected. CWE-88 could still be applicable as argument delimiters might be involved in crafting the injected command.\n\nCWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) is also considered as a secondary CWE. Although the primary concern is command injection, the injected commands could potentially lead to the exposure of sensitive system information. The execution of arbitrary commands might allow an attacker to access and exfiltrate sensitive data.\n\nCWE-863, CWE-285, CWE-138, CWE-95, and CWE-79 were considered but not selected as primary CWEs. CWE-863 and CWE-285 relate to authorization issues, but the primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation. CWE-138 is a higher-level class related to improper neutralization, but CWE-78 is a more specific base-level CWE. CWE-95 relates to eval injection, which is not the case here, and CWE-79 relates to cross-site scripting, which is also not applicable.\n\nThe selection of CWE-78 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: the lack of proper neutralization of special elements in OS commands. The provided evidence and the relationship analysis support this classification.",
