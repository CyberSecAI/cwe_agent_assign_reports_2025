The input parameter validation is not strict, allowing attackers to insert commands for remote command execution, The prerequisite for a successful attack is that the user needs to log in to the streampark system and have system-level permissions. Generally, only users of that system have the authorization to log in, and users would not manually input a dangerous operation command. Therefore, the risk level of this vulnerability is very low. Mitigation all users should upgrade to 2.1.4 Background info Log in to Streampark using the default username (e.g. test1, test2, test3) and the **default password** (streampark). Navigate to the Project module, then add a new project. Enter the git repository address of the project and input `touch /tmp/success_2.1.2` as the Build Argument. Note that there is no verification and interception of the special character `. As a result, you will find that this injection command will be successfully executed after executing the build. In the latest version, the special symbol ` is intercepted.', key_phrases={'rootcause': ['default password', 'improper input validation'], 'weakness': 'command injection', 'impact': ['command execution', 'execute commands'], 'vector': '', 'attacker': 'attackers', 'product': 'streampark', 'version': 'before 2.1.4', 'component': 'Project module'}, reference_content='```\\n{\\n  \"Root cause of vulnerability\": \"Insufficient input validation in the project module\\'s Maven build parameter handling allows for command injection.\",\\n  \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present\": \"Command injection due to lack of proper input sanitization of build arguments.\",\\n  \"Impact of exploitation\": \"Remote command execution on the server hosting the Apache StreamPark instance.\",\\n  \"Attack vectors\": \"By adding or modifying a project\\'s build arguments within the Apache StreamPark web interface.

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    In streampark, the project module integrates Mavens compilation capabilities. The input parameter validation is not strict, allowing attackers to insert commands for remote command execution, The prerequisite for a successful attack is that the user needs to log in to the streampark system and have system-level permissions. Generally, only users of that system have the authorization to log in, and users would not manually input a dangerous operation command. Therefore, the risk level of this vulnerability is very low. Mitigation all users should upgrade to 2.1.4 Background info Log in to Streampark using the default username (e.g. test1, test2, test3) and the **default password** (streampark). Navigate to the Project module, then add a new project. Enter the git repository address of the project and input `touch /tmp/success_2.1.2` as the Build Argument. Note that there is no verification and interception of the special character `. As a result, you will find that this injection command will be successfully executed after executing the build. In the latest version, the special symbol ` is intercepted.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'default password'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
