Several other CWEs were considered, including more specific Base-level CWEs like CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) and CWE-280 (Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges). However, based on the provided description, the root cause of the vulnerability is generally described as an \"Improper Privilege Management\" issue, without specifying the exact mechanism. Therefore, while less specific, CWE-269 is chosen as the best fit.

The vulnerability description clearly states \"***Improper Privilege Management*** vulnerability\".\n\nThe analysis considered the MITRE mapping guidance and the retriever results. While CWE-269 is a class-level CWE and is generally discouraged, the lack of specific information about the underlying cause makes it difficult to assign a more specific base-level CWE.
