# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-13320

## Description

The CURCY - WooCommerce Multi Currency - Currency Switcher plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the wc_filter_price_meta[where] parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.6 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query
- **Weakness:** SQL injection

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient escaping** on the user-supplied parameter and a **lack of sufficient preparation** on the existing SQL query, leading to the **SQL injection** vulnerability, which allows attackers to extract sensitive information.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly states that the issue is due to **insufficient escaping** and a **lack of sufficient preparation** on the SQL query. This directly corresponds to CWE-89, which deals with the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an SQL command. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries to extract sensitive information.

The retriever results also list CWE-89 as the top candidate with a score of 1.0.

The other CWEs listed in the retriever results were considered but deemed less relevant. For example, CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output) is a more general class of vulnerability and less specific than CWE-89.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

*CWE-352 was not selected because the vulnerability description does not indicate a CSRF issue.*

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*CWE-425 was not selected because the vulnerability is related to **insufficient escaping** of SQL commands.*

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*CWE-472 was not selected because the vulnerability is related to **insufficient escaping** of SQL commands.*

## CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*CWE-96 was not selected because the vulnerability is related to **insufficient escaping** of SQL commands.*

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
