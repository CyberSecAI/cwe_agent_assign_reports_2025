  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved pinctrl fix **deadlock** in create_pinctrl() when handling -EPROBE_DEFER In create_pinctrl(), pinctrl_maps_mutex is acquired before calling add_setting(). If add_setting() returns -EPROBE_DEFER, create_pinctrl() calls pinctrl_free(). However, pinctrl_free() attempts to acquire pinctrl_maps_mutex, which is already held by create_pinctrl(), leading to a potential **deadlock**. This patch resolves the issue by releasing pinctrl_maps_mutex before calling pinctrl_free(), preventing the **deadlock**. This bug was discovered and resolved using Coverity Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) by Synopsys, Inc.",

  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A deadlock occurs in the `create_pinctrl()` function when handling the `-EPROBE_DEFER` return value from the `add_setting()` function.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    - The `pinctrl_maps_mutex` is acquired before calling `add_setting()`.\n    - If `add_setting()` returns `-EPROBE_DEFER`, `create_pinctrl()` calls `pinctrl_free()`.\n    - `pinctrl_free()` attempts to acquire `pinctrl_maps_mutex`, which is already held by `create_pinctrl()`, resulting in a deadlock.\n-   **Impact of exploitation:** A deadlock scenario is triggered, which can halt the system or make it unresponsive, causing a denial of service.\n-   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves triggering the scenario where the `add_setting()` function returns `-EPROBE_DEFER` during the `create_pinctrl` process. This can occur when a resource is temporarily unavailable, and the system has not set up the pinctrl subsystem properly.\n-   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker does not require any special capabilities. Triggering the scenario can likely be accomplished by an unprivileged user or by a driver loading a device.\n\nThe provided patches modify the `create_pinctrl()` function in `drivers/pinctrl/core.c` to release the `pinctrl_maps_mutex` before calling `pinctrl_free()` if `-EPROBE_DEFER` is returned from `add_setting()`. This prevents the deadlock.",

CWE-667 (Improper Locking) is a class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-833. The vulnerability description clearly indicates a deadlock situation caused by improper locking, so CWE-833 is the more specific and appropriate choice. There are no other significant hierarchical or chain relationships that influence the selection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe833[\"CWE-833: Deadlock\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    \n    cwe833 -->|CHILDOF| cwe667\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe833 primary\n    class cwe667 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of the following steps:\n1.  `pinctrl_maps_mutex` is acquired.\n2.  `add_setting()` is called.\n3.  `add_setting()` returns `-EPROBE_DEFER`.\n4.  `create_pinctrl()` calls `pinctrl_free()`.\n5.  `pinctrl_free()` attempts to acquire `pinctrl_maps_mutex`, leading to a **deadlock**.\n\nThe root cause is the **improper locking** mechanism, but the direct result and main weakness is the **deadlock** itself.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The description clearly states that a **deadlock** occurs because `pinctrl_free()` attempts to acquire a mutex that is already held by `create_pinctrl()`.\n\n> **Vulnerability Description**: In create_pinctrl(), pinctrl_maps_mutex is acquired before calling add_setting(). If add_setting() returns -EPROBE_DEFER, create_pinctrl() calls pinctrl_free(). However, pinctrl_free() attempts to acquire pinctrl_maps_mutex, which is already held by create_pinctrl(), leading to a potential **deadlock**.\n\nThe retriever results also point to CWE-833 (Deadlock) and CWE-667 (Improper Locking) as potential candidates. Given that the base-level CWE-833 (Deadlock) accurately describes the vulnerability, it is chosen as the primary CWE. The parent class CWE-667 (Improper Locking) is considered as a secondary candidate but is less specific.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-833: Deadlock\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not lock or does not correctly lock a resource when the product must have exclusive access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
