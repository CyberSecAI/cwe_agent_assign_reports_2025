If the Provider is not specified and /dev/urandom or an Entropy Gathering Daemon (egd) service is not available CryptRandom will default to use the **insecure CryptRandomrand provider**.

It relied on Perl's internal `rand` function, which is not a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG).\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n\\n*   Use of a non-cryptographically secure random number generator (`rand`) as a default or available option.\\n*   Potential for predictable or biased random numbers when using the `rand` provider.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n\\nUsing the insecure `rand` provider could compromise the security of applications relying on `Crypt::Random` for generating random numbers, especially in cryptographic contexts. This could lead to vulnerabilities such as:\\n\\n*   Predictable keys or initialization vectors.\\n*   Weakened encryption.\\n*   Successful attacks against systems relying on randomness for security.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n\\nAn attacker could exploit the vulnerability by:\\n\\n*   Forcing the application to use the `rand` provider.\\n*   Predicting the output of the `rand` function and using this information to compromise the system.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n\\nThe attacker would need to be able to influence the application to use the insecure `rand` provider. This could involve:\\n\\n*   Controlling the application's configuration.\\n*   Exploiting a vulnerability that allows them to specify the random number generator.\\n\\n**Mitigation or fix:**\\n\\nThe following steps were taken to mitigate the vulnerability:\\n\\n1.  **Switch to `Crypt::URandom`:** The `rand` provider was updated to use `Crypt::URandom::urandom` instead of Perl's internal `rand` function. This provides a more secure random number generation mechanism.\\n2.  **Move `rand` and `egd` to low strength list:** The `rand` and `egd` providers were moved to the low strength provider list.\\n3.  **Default to strong randomness:** The code now defaults to using strong randomness (using `/dev/urandom` or `Crypt::URandom::urandom`) if the `Strength` parameter is not explicitly specified.\\n4.  **Added Win32API Provider:** A new Win32API Provider was added for Windows.\\n5.  **Documentation update:** The documentation for `rand` explicitly states that it is *not* cryptographically secure and recommends using other modules for security-sensitive applications.\\n\\n**Additional details:**\\n\\n*   The commit messages indicate a broader effort to modernize the `Crypt::Random` module, including moving to `Dist::Zilla` for building, adding GitHub Actions for testing, and updating copyright information.\\n*   The perldoc.perl.org documentation for `rand` also explicitly warns against using it in security-sensitive situations and lists alternative modules for cryptographically secure random number generation.\\n\\n**Note:** This analysis is based solely on the provided content.

Sometimes a mediocre source of randomness is sufficient or preferable for algorithms that use random numbers. Weak generators generally take less processing power and/or do not use the precious, finite, entropy sources on a system. While such PRNGs might have very useful features, these same features could be used to break the cryptography.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-3692: PHP framework uses mt_rand() function (Marsenne Twister) when generating tokens\n\n- CVE-2009-3278: Crypto product uses rand() library function to generate a recovery key, making it easier to conduct brute force attacks.\n\n- CVE-2009-3238: Random number generator can repeatedly generate the same value.\n\n- CVE-2009-2367: Web application generates predictable session IDs, allowing session hijacking.\n\n- CVE-2008-0166: SSL library uses a weak random number generator that only generates 65,536 unique keys.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-34430: Eclipse TinyDTLS through 0.9-rc1 relies on the rand function in the C library, which makes it easier for remote attackers to compute the master key and then decrypt DTLS traffic.\n\n- CVE-2021-43799: Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool. Zulip Server installs RabbitMQ for internal message passing. In versions of Zulip Server prior to 4.9, the initial installation (until first reboot, or restart of RabbitMQ) does not successfully limit the default ports which RabbitMQ opens; this includes port 25672, the RabbitMQ distribution port, which is used as a management port. RabbitMQ's default \"cookie\" which protects this port is generated using a weak PRNG, which limits the entropy of the password to at most 36 bits; in practicality, the seed for the randomizer is biased, resulting in approximately 20 bits of entropy. If other firewalls (at the OS or network level) do not protect port 25672, a remote attacker can brute-force the 20 bits of entropy in the \"cookie\" and leverage it for arbitrary execution of code as the rabbitmq user. They can also read all data which is sent through RabbitMQ, which includes all message traffic sent by users. Version 4.9 contains a patch for this vulnerability. As a workaround, ensure that firewalls prevent access to ports 5672 and 25672 from outside the Zulip server.\n\n- CVE-2021-45484: In NetBSD through 9.2, the IPv6 fragment ID generation algorithm employs a weak cryptographic PRNG.\n\n- CVE-2021-45489: In NetBSD through 9.2, the IPv6 Flow Label generation algorithm employs a weak cryptographic PRNG.\n\n- CVE-2022-29245: SSH.NET is a Secure Shell (SSH) library for .NET. In versions 2020.0.0 and 2020.0.1, during an `X25519` key exchange, the client\u2019s private key is generated with `System.Random`. `System.Random` is not a cryptographically secure random number generator, it must therefore not be used for cryptographic purposes. When establishing an SSH connection to a remote host, during the X25519 key exchange, the private key is generated with a weak random number generator whose seed can be brute forced. This allows an attacker who is able to eavesdrop on the communications to decrypt them. Version 2020.0.2 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, one may disable support for `curve25519-sha256` and `curve25519-sha256@libssh.org` key exchange algorithms.\n\n- CVE-2022-45782: An issue was discovered in dotCMS core 5.3.8.5 through 5.3.8.15 and 21.03 through 22.10.1.

They rely on cryptographically secure and unique seeds for entropy so proper seeding is critical to the secure operation of the PRNG.\n\n\n Management of seeds could be broken down into two main areas: \n\n\n  -  (1) protecting seeds as cryptographic material (such as a cryptographic key); \n\n  -  (2) whenever possible, using a uniquely generated seed from a cryptographically secure source \n\n PRNGs require a seed as input to generate a stream of numbers that are functionally indistinguishable from random numbers. While the output is, in many cases, sufficient for cryptographic uses, the output of any PRNG is directly determined by the seed provided as input. If the seed can be ascertained by a third party, the entire output of the PRNG can be made known to them. As such, the seed should be kept secret and should ideally not be able to be guessed. For example, the current time may be a poor seed. Knowing the approximate time the PRNG was seeded greatly reduces the possible key space. \n\n Seeds do not necessarily need to be unique, but reusing seeds may open up attacks if the seed is discovered. \n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-7010: Cloud application on Kubernetes generates passwords using a weak random number generator based on deployment time.\n\n- CVE-2019-11495: server uses erlang:now() to seed the PRNG, which results in a small search space for potential random seeds\n\n- CVE-2018-12520: Product's PRNG is not seeded for the generation of session IDs\n\n- CVE-2016-10180: Router's PIN generation is based on rand(time(0)) seeding.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-27211: steghide 0.5.1 relies on a certain 32-bit seed value, which makes it easier for attackers to detect hidden data.\n\n- CVE-2021-34600: Telenot CompasX versions prior to 32.0 use a weak seed for random number generation leading to predictable AES keys used in the NFC tags used for local authorization of users. This may lead to total loss of trustworthiness of the installation. \n\n- CVE-2021-41117: keypair is a a RSA PEM key generator written in javascript. keypair implements a lot of cryptographic primitives on its own or by borrowing from other libraries where possible, including node-forge. An issue was discovered where this library was generating identical RSA keys used in SSH. This would mean that the library is generating identical P, Q (and thus N) values which, in practical terms, is impossible with RSA-2048 keys. Generating identical values, repeatedly, usually indicates an issue with poor random number generation, or, poor handling of CSPRNG output. Issue 1: Poor random number generation (`GHSL-2021-1012`). The library does not rely entirely on a platform provided CSPRNG, rather, it uses it's own counter-based CMAC approach. Where things go wrong is seeding the CMAC implementation with \"true\" random data in the function `defaultSeedFile`. In order to seed the AES-CMAC generator, the library will take two different approaches depending on the JavaScript execution environment. In a browser, the library will use [`window.crypto.getRandomValues()`](https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/blob/87c62f255baa12c1ec4f98a91600f82af80be6db/index.js#L971). However, in a nodeJS execution environment, the `window` object is not defined, so it goes down a much less secure solution, also of which has a bug in it. It does look like the library tries to use node's CSPRNG when possible unfortunately, it looks like the `crypto` object is null because a variable was declared with the same name, and set to `null`. So the node CSPRNG path is never taken. However, when `window.crypto.getRandomValues()` is not available, a Lehmer LCG random number generator is used to seed the CMAC counter, and the LCG is seeded with `Math.random`. While this is poor and would likely qualify in a security bug in itself, it does not explain the extreme frequency in which duplicate keys occur. The main flaw: The output from the Lehmer LCG is encoded incorrectly. The specific [line][https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/blob/87c62f255baa12c1ec4f98a91600f82af80be6db/index.js#L1008] with the flaw is: `b.putByte(String.fromCharCode(next & 0xFF))` The [definition](https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/blob/87c62f255baa12c1ec4f98a91600f82af80be6db/index.js#L350-L352) of `putByte` is `util.ByteBuffer.prototype.putByte = function(b) {this.data += String.fromCharCode(b);};`. Simplified, this is `String.fromCharCode(String.fromCharCode(next & 0xFF))`. The double `String.fromCharCode` is almost certainly unintentional and the source of weak seeding. Unfortunately, this does not result in an error. Rather, it results most of the buffer containing zeros. Since we are masking with 0xFF, we can determine that 97% of the output from the LCG are converted to zeros. The only outputs that result in meaningful values are outputs 48 through 57, inclusive. The impact is that each byte in the RNG seed has a 97% chance of being 0 due to incorrect conversion. When it is not, the bytes are 0 through 9. In summary, there are three immediate concerns: 1. The library has an insecure random number fallback path. Ideally the library would require a strong CSPRNG instead of attempting to use a LCG and `Math.random`. 2. The library does not correctly use a strong random number generator when run in NodeJS, even though a strong CSPRNG is available. 3. The fallback path has an issue in the implementation where a majority of the seed data is going to effectively be zero. Due to the poor random number generation, keypair generates RSA keys that are relatively easy to guess. This could enable an attacker to decrypt confidential messages or gain authorized access to an account belonging to the victim.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-330 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-330 (ChildOf)",

It is important to fix because this creates a static nonce and since aes-gcm is a stream cipher, this can lead to known cryptographic issues, since the same key is being reused. From 2.4.9 onwards this has been patched to use dynamic values through usage of cjose AES encryption routines.\n\n- CVE-2020-1472: An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when an attacker establishes a vulnerable Netlogon secure channel connection to a domain controller, using the Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC).

Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.\n\n\nIt is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.\n\n\nSince the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered \"unsafe\" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.\n\n\nFor a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-30273: SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity\n\n- CVE-2022-30320: Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.\n\n- CVE-2008-3775: Product uses \"ROT-25\" to obfuscate the password in the registry.\n\n- CVE-2007-4150: product only uses \"XOR\" to obfuscate sensitive data\n\n- CVE-2007-5460: product only uses \"XOR\" and a fixed key to obfuscate sensitive data\n\n- CVE-2005-4860: Product substitutes characters with other characters in a fixed way, and also leaves certain input characters unchanged.\n\n- CVE-2002-2058: Attackers can infer private IP addresses by dividing each octet by the MD5 hash of '20'.\n\n- CVE-2008-3188: Product uses DES when MD5 has been specified in the configuration, resulting in weaker-than-expected password hashes.\n\n- CVE-2005-2946: Default configuration of product uses MD5 instead of stronger algorithms that are available, simplifying forgery of certificates.\n\n- CVE-2007-6013: Product uses the hash of a hash for authentication, allowing attackers to gain privileges if they can obtain the original hash.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-15128: In OctoberCMS before version 1.0.468, encrypted cookie values were not tied to the name of the cookie the value belonged to. This meant that certain classes of attacks that took advantage of other theoretical vulnerabilities in user facing code (nothing exploitable in the core project itself) had a higher chance of succeeding. Specifically, if your usage exposed a way for users to provide unfiltered user input and have it returned to them as an encrypted cookie (ex. storing a user provided search query in a cookie) they could then use the generated cookie in place of other more tightly controlled cookies; or if your usage exposed the plaintext version of an encrypted cookie at any point to the user they could theoretically provide encrypted content from your application back to it as an encrypted cookie and force the framework to decrypt it for them.

This allows an attacker to take complete control of InsightIQ to affect services provided by SSH; so Dell recommends customers to upgrade at the earliest opportunity.\n\n- CVE-2021-41263: rails_multisite provides multi-db support for Rails applications. In affected versions this vulnerability impacts any Rails applications using `rails_multisite` alongside Rails' signed/encrypted cookies. Depending on how the application makes use of these cookies, it may be possible for an attacker to re-use cookies on different 'sites' within a multi-site Rails application. The issue has been patched in v4 of the `rails_multisite` gem. Note that this upgrade will invalidate all previous signed/encrypted cookies. The impact of this invalidation will vary based on the application architecture.\n\n- CVE-2021-32001: K3s in SUSE Rancher allows any user with direct access to the datastore, or a copy of a datastore backup, to extract the cluster's confidential keying material (cluster certificate authority private keys, secrets encryption configuration passphrase, etc.) and decrypt it, without having to know the token value. This issue affects: SUSE Rancher K3s version v1.19.12+k3s1, v1.20.8+k3s1, v1.21.2+k3s1 and prior versions; RKE2 version v1.19.12+rke2r1, v1.20.8+rke2r1, v1.21.2+rke2r1 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2020-36315: In RELIC before 2020-08-01, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature forgery can occur because certain checks of the padding (and of the first two bytes) are inadequate.

Laravel prior to versions 8.75.0, 7.30.6, and 6.20.42 contain a possible cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Blade templating engine. A broken HTML element may be clicked and the user taken to another location in their browser due to XSS. This is due to the user being able to guess the parent placeholder SHA-1 hash by trying common names of sections. If the parent template contains an exploitable HTML structure an XSS vulnerability can be exposed. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 8.75.0, 7.30.6, and 6.20.42 by determining the parent placeholder at runtime and using a random hash that is unique to each request.\n\n- CVE-2021-31562: The SSL/TLS configuration of Fresenius Kabi Agilia Link + version 3.0 has serious deficiencies that may allow an attacker to compromise SSL/TLS sessions in different ways.

An attacker that obtained access to the administrative web interface of a printer (e.g., by using the default credentials) can download the address book file, which contains the list of users (domain users, FTP users, etc.) stored on the printer, together with their encrypted passwords. The passwords are protected by a weak cipher, such as ROT13, which requires minimal effort to instantly retrieve the original password, giving the attacker a list of valid domain or FTP usernames and passwords.\n\n- CVE-2021-43989: mySCADA myPRO Versions 8.20.0 and prior stores passwords using MD5, which may allow an attacker to crack the previously retrieved password hashes.\n\n- CVE-2021-45512: Certain NETGEAR devices are affected by weak cryptography. This affects D7000v2 before 1.0.0.62, D8500 before 1.0.3.50, EX3700 before 1.0.0.84, EX3800 before 1.0.0.84, EX6120 before 1.0.0.54, EX6130 before 1.0.0.36, EX7000 before 1.0.1.90, R6250 before 1.0.4.42, R6400v2 before 1.0.4.98, R6700v3 before 1.0.4.98, R6900P before 1.3.2.124, R7000 before 1.0.11.106, R7000P before 1.3.2.124, R7100LG before 1.0.0.56, R7900 before 1.0.4.26, R8000 before 1.0.4.58, R8300 before 1.0.2.134, R8500 before 1.0.2.134, RS400 before 1.5.0.48, WNR3500Lv2 before 1.2.0.62, and XR300 before 1.0.3.50.\n\n- CVE-2021-45696: An issue was discovered in the sha2 crate 0.9.7 before 0.9.8 for Rust. Hashes of long messages may be incorrect when the AVX2-accelerated backend is used.\n\n- CVE-2022-0377: Users of the LearnPress WordPress plugin before 4.1.5 can upload an image as a profile avatar after the registration. After this process the user crops and saves the image. Then a \"POST\" request that contains user supplied name of the image is sent to the server for renaming and cropping of the image. As a result of this request, the name of the user-supplied image is changed with a MD5 value. This process can be conducted only when type of the image is JPG or PNG. An attacker can use this vulnerability in order to rename an arbitrary image file. By doing this, they could destroy the design of the web site.\n\n- CVE-2022-1252: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm in GitHub repository gnuboard/gnuboard5 prior to and including 5.5.5. A vulnerability in gnuboard v5.5.5 and below uses weak encryption algorithms leading to sensitive information exposure. This allows an attacker to derive the email address of any user, including when the 'Let others see my information.' box is ticked off. Or to send emails to any email address, with full control of its contents \n\n- CVE-2022-1434: The OpenSSL 3.0 implementation of the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite incorrectly uses the AAD data as the MAC key. This makes the MAC key trivially predictable. An attacker could exploit this issue by performing a man-in-the-middle attack to modify data being sent from one endpoint to an OpenSSL 3.0 recipient such that the modified data would still pass the MAC integrity check. Note that data sent from an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will always be rejected by the recipient and the connection will fail at that point. Many application protocols require data to be sent from the client to the server first. Therefore, in such a case, only an OpenSSL 3.0 server would be impacted when talking to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 client. If both endpoints are OpenSSL 3.0 then the attacker could modify data being sent in both directions. In this case both clients and servers could be affected, regardless of the application protocol. Note that in the absence of an attacker this bug means that an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint communicating with a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will fail to complete the handshake when using this ciphersuite. The confidentiality of data is not impacted by this issue, i.e. an attacker cannot decrypt data that has been encrypted using this ciphersuite - they can only modify it. In order for this attack to work both endpoints must legitimately negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite. This ciphersuite is not compiled by default in OpenSSL 3.0, and is not available within the default provider or the default ciphersuite list. This ciphersuite will never be used if TLSv1.3 has been negotiated. In order for an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to use this ciphersuite the following must have occurred: 1) OpenSSL must have been compiled with the (non-default) compile time option enable-weak-ssl-ciphers 2) OpenSSL must have had the legacy provider explicitly loaded (either through application code or via configuration) 3) The ciphersuite must have been explicitly added to the ciphersuite list 4) The libssl security level must have been set to 0 (default is 1) 5) A version of SSL/TLS below TLSv1.3 must have been negotiated 6) Both endpoints must negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite in preference to any others that both endpoints have in common Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2).\n\n- CVE-2022-20805: A vulnerability in the automatic decryption process in Cisco Umbrella Secure Web Gateway (SWG) could allow an authenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass the SSL decryption and content filtering policies on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to how the decryption function uses the TLS Sever Name Indication (SNI) extension of an HTTP request to discover the destination domain and determine if the request needs to be decrypted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request over TLS from a client to an unknown or controlled URL. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to bypass the decryption process of Cisco Umbrella SWG and allow malicious content to be downloaded to a host on a protected network. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-2097: AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimised implementation will not encrypt the entirety of the data under some circumstances. This could reveal sixteen bytes of data that was preexisting in the memory that wasn't written. In the special case of \"in place\" encryption, sixteen bytes of the plaintext would be revealed. Since OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and DTLS, they are both unaffected. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.5 (Affected 3.0.0-3.0.4). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1q (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1p).\n\n- CVE-2022-2781: In affected versions of Octopus Server it was identified that the same encryption process was used for both encrypting session cookies and variables.\n\n- CVE-2022-28164: Brocade SANnav before SANnav 2.2.0 application uses the Blowfish symmetric encryption algorithm for the storage of passwords. This could allow an authenticated attacker to decrypt stored account passwords.\n\n- CVE-2022-28382: An issue was discovered in certain Verbatim drives through 2022-03-31. Due to the use of an insecure encryption AES mode (Electronic Codebook, aka ECB), an attacker may be able to extract information even from encrypted data, for example by observing repeating byte patterns. The firmware of the USB-to-SATA bridge controller INIC-3637EN uses AES-256 with the ECB mode. This operation mode of block ciphers (e.g., AES) always encrypts identical plaintext data, in this case blocks of 16 bytes, to identical ciphertext data. For some data, for instance bitmap images, the lack of the cryptographic property called diffusion, within ECB, can leak sensitive information even in encrypted data. Thus, the use of the ECB operation mode can put the confidentiality of specific information at risk, even in an encrypted form. This affects Keypad Secure USB 3.2 Gen 1 Drive Part Number #49428, Store 'n' Go Secure Portable HDD GD25LK01-3637-C VER4.0, Executive Fingerprint Secure SSD GDMSFE01-INI3637-C VER1.1, and Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive Part Number #53650.\n\n- CVE-2022-29960: Emerson OpenBSI through 2022-04-29 uses weak cryptography. It is an engineering environment for the ControlWave and Bristol Babcock line of RTUs. DES with hardcoded cryptographic keys is used for protection of certain system credentials, engineering files, and sensitive utilities.\n\n- CVE-2022-30320: Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD through 2022-05-06 uses a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm. According to FSCT-2022-0063, there is a Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD S-Bus weak credential hashing scheme issue. The affected components are characterized as: S-Bus (5050/UDP) authentication. The potential impact is: Authentication bypass. The Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD controllers utilize the S-Bus protocol (5050/UDP) for a variety of engineering purposes. It is possible to configure a password in order to restrict access to sensitive engineering functionality. Authentication is done by using the S-Bus 'write byte' message to a specific address and supplying a hashed version of the password. The hashing algorithm used is based on CRC-16 and as such not cryptographically secure. An insecure hashing algorithm is used. An attacker capable of passively observing traffic can intercept the hashed credentials and trivially find collisions allowing for authentication without having to bruteforce a keyspace defined by the actual strength of the password. This allows the attacker access to sensitive engineering functionality such as uploading/downloading control logic and manipulating controller configuration.\n\n- CVE-2022-35513: The Blink1Control2 application <= 2.2.7 uses weak password encryption and an insecure method of storage.\n\n- CVE-2022-38493: Rhonabwy 0.9.99 through 1.1.x before 1.1.7 doesn't check the RSA private key length before RSA-OAEP decryption. This allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service via a crafted JWE (JSON Web Encryption) token.\n\n- CVE-2022-39237: syslabs/sif is the Singularity Image Format (SIF) reference implementation. In versions prior to 2.8.1the `github.com/sylabs/sif/v2/pkg/integrity` package did not verify that the hash algorithm(s) used are cryptographically secure when verifying digital signatures. A patch is available in version >= v2.8.1 of the module. Users are encouraged to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may independently validate that the hash algorithm(s) used for metadata digest(s) and signature hash are cryptographically secure.\n\n- CVE-2022-28166: In Brocade SANnav version before SANN2.2.0.2 and Brocade SANNav before 2.1.1.8, the implementation of TLS/SSL Server Supports the Use of Static Key Ciphers (ssl-static-key-ciphers) on ports 443 & 18082.\n\n- CVE-2022-30187: Azure Storage Library Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-23839: OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate SSLv2 with a server that is configured to support both SSLv2 and more recent SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version rollback attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or TLS versions greater than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form of padding. A server that supports greater than SSLv2 is supposed to reject connection attempts from a client where this special form of padding is present, because this indicates that a version rollback has occurred (i.e. both client and server support greater than SSLv2, and yet this is the version that is being requested). The implementation of this padding check inverted the logic so that the connection attempt is accepted if the padding is present, and rejected if it is absent. This means that such as server will accept a connection if a version rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously reject a connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made. Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x are affected by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1) have configured SSLv2 support at compile time (this is off by default), 2) have configured SSLv2 support at runtime (this is off by default), 3) have configured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default ciphersuite list) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore is not vulnerable to this issue. The underlying error is in the implementation of the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function. This also affects the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. Although 1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function still exists, as does the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode. Applications that directly call that function or use that padding mode will encounter this issue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1 this is considered a bug and not a security issue in that version. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2s-1.0.2x).\n\n- CVE-2021-20379: IBM Guardium Data Encryption (GDE) 3.0.0.3 and 4.0.0.4 uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms that could allow an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information. IBM X-Force ID: 195711.\n\n- CVE-2021-20406: IBM Security Verify Information Queue 1.0.6 and 1.0.7 uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms that could allow an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information.

IBM X-Force ID: 199238.\n\n- CVE-2021-22212: ntpkeygen can generate keys that ntpd fails to parse. NTPsec 1.2.0 allows ntpkeygen to generate keys with '#' characters. ntpd then either pads, shortens the key, or fails to load these keys entirely, depending on the key type and the placement of the '#'. This results in the administrator not being able to use the keys as expected or the keys are shorter than expected and easier to brute-force, possibly resulting in MITM attacks between ntp clients and ntp servers. For short AES128 keys, ntpd generates a warning that it is padding them.\n\n- CVE-2021-22356: There is a weak secure algorithm vulnerability in Huawei products. A weak secure algorithm is used in a module. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by capturing and analyzing the messages between devices to obtain information.

In affected versions broken encryption in app-functions-sdk \u201cAES\u201d transform in EdgeX Foundry releases prior to Jakarta allows attackers to decrypt messages via unspecified vectors. The app-functions-sdk exports an \u201caes\u201d transform that user scripts can optionally call to encrypt data in the processing pipeline. No decrypt function is provided. Encryption is not enabled by default, but if used, the level of protection may be less than the user may expects due to a broken implementation. Version v2.1.0 (EdgeX Foundry Jakarta release and later) of app-functions-sdk-go/v2 deprecates the \u201caes\u201d transform and provides an improved \u201caes256\u201d transform in its place. The broken implementation will remain in a deprecated state until it is removed in the next EdgeX major release to avoid breakage of existing software that depends on the broken implementation. As the broken transform is a library function that is not invoked by default, users who do not use the AES transform in their processing pipelines are unaffected. Those that are affected are urged to upgrade to the Jakarta EdgeX release and modify processing pipelines to use the new \"aes256\" transform.\n\n- CVE-2021-42583: A Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm exists in Max Mazurov Maddy before 0.5.2, which is an unnecessary risk that may result in the exposure of sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-43550: The use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm is an unnecessary risk that may result in the exposure of sensitive information, which affects the communications between Patient Information Center iX (PIC iX) Versions C.02 and C.03 and Efficia CM Series Revisions A.01 to C.0x and 4.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-20117: In (TBD) of (TBD), there is a possible way to decrypt local data encrypted by the GSC due to improperly used crypto.

However, when these credentials are easily predictable or even fixed (as with default or hard-coded passwords and keys), then the attacker can defeat the mechanism without relying on brute force.\n\n\nCredentials may be weak for different reasons, such as:\n\n\n  - Hard-coded (i.e., static and unchangeable by the administrator)\n\n  - Default (i.e., the same static value across different deployments/installations, but able to be changed by the administrator)\n\n  - Predictable (i.e., generated in a way that produces unique credentials across deployments/installations, but can still be guessed with reasonable efficiency)\n\nEven if a new, unique credential is intended to be generated for each product installation, if the generation is predictable, then that may also simplify guessing attacks.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- [REF-1374]: Chain: JavaScript-based cryptocurrency library can fall back to the insecure Math.random() function instead of reporting a failure (CWE-392), thus reducing the entropy (CWE-332) and leading to generation of non-unique cryptographic keys for Bitcoin wallets (CWE-1391)\n\n- CVE-2022-30270: Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses default credentials for some SSH accounts\n\n- CVE-2022-29965: Distributed Control System (DCS) uses a deterministic algorithm to generate utility passwords\n\n- CVE-2022-30271: Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used in typical deployments\n\n- CVE-2021-38759: microcontroller board has default password, allowing admin access\n\n- CVE-2021-41192: data visualization/sharing package uses default secret keys or cookie values if they are not specified in environment variables\n\n- CVE-2020-8994: UART interface for AI speaker uses empty password for root shell\n\n- CVE-2020-27020: password manager does not generate cryptographically strong passwords, allowing prediction of passwords using guessable details such as time of generation\n\n- CVE-2020-8632: password generator for cloud application has small length value, making it easier for brute-force guessing\n\n- CVE-2020-5365: network-attached storage (NAS) system has predictable default passwords for a diagnostics/support account\n\n- CVE-2020-5248: IT asset management app has a default encryption key that is the same across installations\n\n- CVE-2018-3825: cloud cluster management product has a default master encryption key\n\n- CVE-2012-3503: Installation script has a hard-coded secret token value, allowing attackers to bypass authentication\n\n- CVE-2010-2306: Intrusion Detection System (IDS) uses the same static, private SSL keys for multiple devices and installations, allowing decryption of SSL traffic\n\n- CVE-2001-0618: Residential gateway uses the last 5 digits of the 'Network Name' or SSID as the default WEP key, which allows attackers to get the key by sniffing the SSID, which is sent in the clear\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-3875: A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Click Studios Passwordstate and Passwordstate Browser Extension Chrome. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the component API. The manipulation leads to authentication bypass by assumed-immutable data. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-216244.\n\n- CVE-2021-3979: A key length flaw was found in Red Hat Ceph Storage. An attacker can exploit the fact that the key length is incorrectly passed in an encryption algorithm to create a non random key, which is weaker and can be exploited for loss of confidentiality and integrity on encrypted disks.\n\n- CVE-2021-42949: The component controlla_login function in HotelDruid Hotel Management Software v3.0.3 generates a predictable session token, allowing attackers to bypass authentication via bruteforce attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-23555: authentik is an open-source Identity Provider focused on flexibility and versatility. Versions prior to 2022.11.4 and 2022.10.4 are vulnerable to Improper Authentication. Token reuse in invitation URLs leads to access control bypass via the use of a different enrollment flow than in the one provided. The vulnerability allows an attacker that knows different invitation flows names (e.g. `enrollment-invitation-test` and `enrollment-invitation-admin`) via either different invite links or via brute forcing to signup via a single invitation url for any valid invite link received (it can even be a url for a third flow as long as it's a valid invite) as the token used in the `Invitations` section of the Admin interface does NOT change when a different `enrollment flow` is selected via the interface and it is NOT bound to the selected flow, so it will be valid for any flow when used. This issue is patched in authentik 2022.11.4,2022.10.4 and 2022.12.0. Only configurations that use invitations and have multiple enrollment flows with invitation stages that grant different permissions are affected. The default configuration is not vulnerable, and neither are configurations with a single enrollment flow. As a workaround, fixed data can be added to invitations which can be checked in the flow to deny requests. Alternatively, an identifier with high entropy (like a UUID) can be used as flow slug, mitigating the attack vector by exponentially decreasing the possibility of discovering other flows.\n\n- CVE-2022-28376: Verizon 5G Home LVSKIHP outside devices through 2022-02-15 allow anyone (knowing the device's serial number) to access a CPE admin website, e.g., at the 10.0.0.1 IP address. The password (for the verizon username) is calculated by concatenating the serial number and the model (i.e., the LVSKIHP string), running the sha256sum program, and extracting the first seven characters concatenated with the last seven characters of that SHA-256 value.\n\n- CVE-2022-34919: The file upload wizard in Zengenti Contensis Classic before 15.2.1.79 does not correctly check that a user has authenticated. By uploading a crafted aspx file, it is possible to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n- CVE-2022-40494: NPS before v0.26.10 was discovered to contain an authentication bypass vulnerability via constantly generating and sending the Auth key and Timestamp parameters.\n\n- CVE-2021-41506: Xiaongmai AHB7008T-MH-V2, AHB7804R-ELS, AHB7804R-MH-V2, AHB7808R-MS-V2, AHB7808R-MS, AHB7808T-MS-V2, AHB7804R-LMS, HI3518_50H10L_S39 V4.02.R11.7601.Nat.Onvif.20170420, V4.02.R11.Nat.Onvif.20160422, V4.02.R11.7601.Nat.Onvif.20170424, V4.02.R11.Nat.Onvif.20170327, V4.02.R11.Nat.Onvif.20161205, V4.02.R11.Nat.20170301, V4.02.R12.Nat.OnvifS.20170727 is affected by a backdoor in the macGuarder and dvrHelper binaries of DVR/NVR/IP camera firmware due to static root account credentials in the system.\n\n- CVE-2022-43917:  IBM WebSphere Application Server 8.5 and 9.0 traditional container uses weaker than expected cryptographic keys that could allow an attacker to decrypt sensitive information. This affects only the containerized version of WebSphere Application Server traditional. IBM X-Force ID: 241045. \n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-1390 (ChildOf)",

BLS signature validation in lotus uses blst library method VerifyCompressed. This method accepts signatures in 2 forms: \"serialized\", and \"compressed\", meaning that BLS signatures can be provided as either of 2 unique byte arrays. Lotus block validation functions perform a uniqueness check on provided blocks. Two blocks are considered distinct if the CIDs of their blockheader do not match. The CID method for blockheader includes the BlockSig of the block. The result of these issues is that it would be possible to punish miners for valid blocks, as there are two different valid block CIDs available for each block, even though this must be unique. By switching from the go based `blst` bindings over to the bindings in `filecoin-ffi`, the code paths now ensure that all signatures are compressed by size and the way they are deserialized.

This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21239: PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. Users of pysaml2 that use the default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. PySAML2 does not ensure that a signed SAML document is correctly signed. The default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend is using the xmlsec1 binary to verify the signature of signed SAML documents, but by default xmlsec1 accepts any type of key found within the given document. xmlsec1 needs to be configured explicitly to only use only _x509 certificates_ for the verification process of the SAML document signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-22708: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could allow an attacker to craft a malicious firmware package and bypass the signature verification mechanism.\n\n- CVE-2021-22734: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in homeLYnk (Wiser For KNX) and spaceLYnk V2.60 and prior which could cause remote code execution when an attacker loads unauthorized code.\n\n- CVE-2021-22735: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists inhomeLYnk (Wiser For KNX) and spaceLYnk V2.60 and prior which could allow remote code execution when unauthorized code is copied to the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-28091: Lasso all versions prior to 2.7.0 has improper verification of a cryptographic signature.\n\n- CVE-2021-3033: An improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks Prisma Cloud Compute console.

This issue impacts: Cortex XSOAR 5.5.0 builds earlier than 1578677; Cortex XSOAR 6.0.2 builds earlier than 1576452; Cortex XSOAR 6.1.0 builds earlier than 1578663; Cortex XSOAR 6.2.0 builds earlier than 1578666. All Cortex XSOAR instances hosted by Palo Alto Networks are protected from this vulnerability; no additional action is required for these instances.\n\n- CVE-2021-33885: An Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity vulnerability in B. Braun SpaceCom2 prior to 012U000062 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to send the device malicious data that will be used in place of the correct data. This results in full system command access and execution because of the lack of cryptographic signatures on critical data sets.\n\n- CVE-2021-37160: A firmware validation issue was discovered in HMI3 Control Panel in Swisslog Healthcare Nexus Panel operated by released versions of software before Nexus Software 7.2.5.7. There is no firmware validation (e.g., cryptographic signature validation) during a File Upload for a firmware update.\n\n- CVE-2020-36284: Union Pay up to 3.4.93.4.9, for android, contains a CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability, allows attackers to shop for free in merchants' websites and mobile apps, via a crafted authentication code (MAC) which is generated based on a secret key which is NULL.\n\n- CVE-2020-36285: Union Pay up to 3.3.12, for iOS mobile apps, contains a CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability, allows attackers to shop for free in merchants' websites and mobile apps, via a crafted authentication code (MAC) which is generated based on a secret key which is NULL.\n\n- CVE-2021-32685: tEnvoy contains the PGP, NaCl, and PBKDF2 in node.js and the browser (hashing, random, encryption, decryption, signatures, conversions), used by TogaTech.org. In versions prior to 7.0.3, the `verifyWithMessage` method of `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey` always returns `true` for any signature that has a SHA-512 hash matching the SHA-512 hash of the message even if the signature was invalid. This issue is patched in version 7.0.3. As a workaround: In `tenvoy.js` under the `verifyWithMessage` method definition within the `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey` class, ensure that the return statement call to `this.verify` ends in `.verified`.\n\n- CVE-2021-32738: js-stellar-sdk is a Javascript library for communicating with a Stellar Horizon server. The `Utils.readChallengeTx` function used in SEP-10 Stellar Web Authentication states in its function documentation that it reads and validates the challenge transaction including verifying that the `serverAccountID` has signed the transaction. In js-stellar-sdk before version 8.2.3, the function does not verify that the server has signed the transaction. Applications that also used `Utils.verifyChallengeTxThreshold` or `Utils.verifyChallengeTxSigners` to verify the signatures including the server signature on the challenge transaction are unaffected as those functions verify the server signed the transaction. Applications calling `Utils.readChallengeTx` should update to version 8.2.3, the first version with a patch for this vulnerability, to ensure that the challenge transaction is completely valid and signed by the server creating the challenge transaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-37927: Zoho ManageEngine ADManager Plus version 7110 and prior allows account takeover via SSO.\n\n- CVE-2021-29108: There is an privilege escalation vulnerability in organization-specific logins in Esri Portal for ArcGIS versions 10.9 and below that may allow a remote, authenticated attacker who is able to intercept and modify a SAML assertion to impersonate another account (XML Signature Wrapping Attack). In addition patching, Esri also strongly recommends as best practice for SAML assertions to be signed and encrypted.\n\n- CVE-2021-20156: Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 contains an improper access control configuration that could allow for a malicious firmware update. It is possible to manually install firmware that may be malicious in nature as there does not appear to be any signature validation done to determine if it is from a known and trusted source. This includes firmware updates that are done via the automated \"check for updates\" in the admin interface. If an attacker is able to masquerade as the update server, the device will not verify that the firmware updates downloaded are legitimate.\n\n- CVE-2020-1464: A spoofing vulnerability exists when Windows incorrectly validates file signatures. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass security features and load improperly signed files. In an attack scenario, an attacker could bypass security features intended to prevent improperly signed files from being loaded. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows validates file signatures. \n\n- CVE-2020-2021: When Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication is enabled and the 'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is disabled (unchecked), improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS SAML authentication enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to access protected resources. The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable server to exploit this vulnerability. This issue affects PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.3; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.9; PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.15, and all versions of PAN-OS 8.0 (EOL). This issue does not affect PAN-OS 7.1. This issue cannot be exploited if SAML is not used for authentication. This issue cannot be exploited if the 'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is enabled (checked) in the SAML Identity Provider Server Profile. Resources that can be protected by SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) authentication are: GlobalProtect Gateway, GlobalProtect Portal, GlobalProtect Clientless VPN, Authentication and Captive Portal, PAN-OS next-generation firewalls (PA-Series, VM-Series) and Panorama web interfaces, Prisma Access In the case of GlobalProtect Gateways, GlobalProtect Portal, Clientless VPN, Captive Portal, and Prisma Access, an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the affected servers can gain access to protected resources if allowed by configured authentication and Security policies. There is no impact on the integrity and availability of the gateway, portal or VPN server. An attacker cannot inspect or tamper with sessions of regular users. In the worst case, this is a critical severity vulnerability with a CVSS Base Score of 10.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N). In the case of PAN-OS and Panorama web interfaces, this issue allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the PAN-OS or Panorama web interfaces to log in as an administrator and perform administrative actions. In the worst-case scenario, this is a critical severity vulnerability with a CVSS Base Score of 10.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). If the web interfaces are only accessible to a restricted management network, then the issue is lowered to a CVSS Base Score of 9.6 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious attempts to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-32977: AVEVA System Platform versions 2017 through 2020 R2 P01 does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.\n\n- CVE-2021-35097: Possible authentication bypass due to improper order of signature verification and hashing in the signature verification call in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-35113: Possible authentication bypass due to improper order of signature verification and hashing in the signature verification call in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-36277: Dell Command | Update, Dell Update, and Alienware Update versions before 4.3 contains an Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature Vulnerability. A local authenticated malicious user may exploit this vulnerability by executing arbitrary code on the system.\n\n- CVE-2021-43074: An improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability [CWE-347] in FortiWeb 6.4 all versions, 6.3.16 and below, 6.2 all versions, 6.1 all versions, 6.0 all versions; FortiOS 7.0.3 and below, 6.4.8 and below, 6.2 all versions, 6.0 all versions; FortiSwitch 7.0.3 and below, 6.4.10 and below, 6.2 all versions, 6.0 all versions; FortiProxy 7.0.1 and below, 2.0.7 and below, 1.2 all versions, 1.1 all versions, 1.0 all versions may allow an attacker to decrypt portions of the administrative session management cookie if able to intercept the latter.\n\n- CVE-2022-1739: The tested version of Dominion Voting Systems ImageCast X does not validate application signatures to a trusted root certificate. Use of a trusted root certificate ensures software installed on a device is traceable to, or verifiable against, a cryptographic key provided by the manufacturer to detect tampering. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to install malicious code, which could also be spread to other vulnerable ImageCast X devices via removable media.\n\n- CVE-2022-20929: A vulnerability in the upgrade signature verification of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to provide an unauthentic upgrade file for upload. This vulnerability is due to insufficient cryptographic signature verification of upgrade files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing an administrator with an unauthentic upgrade file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to fully compromise the Cisco NFVIS system.\n\n- CVE-2022-23507: Tendermint is a high-performance blockchain consensus engine for Byzantine fault tolerant applications. Versions prior to 0.28.0 contain a potential attack via Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature, affecting anyone using the tendermint-light-client and related packages to perform light client verification (e.g. IBC-rs, Hermes). The light client does not check that the chain IDs of the trusted and untrusted headers match, resulting in a possible attack vector where someone who finds a header from an untrusted chain that satisfies all other verification conditions (e.g. enough overlapping validator signatures) could fool a light client. The attack vector is currently theoretical, and no proof-of-concept exists yet to exploit it on live networks. This issue is patched in version 0.28.0. There are no workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24759: `@chainsafe/libp2p-noise` contains TypeScript implementation of noise protocol, an encryption protocol used in libp2p. `@chainsafe/libp2p-noise` before 4.1.2 and 5.0.3 does not correctly validate signatures during the handshake process. This may allow a man-in-the-middle to pose as other peers and get those peers banned. Users should upgrade to version 4.1.2 or 5.0.3 to receive a patch. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-25898: The package jsrsasign before 10.5.25 are vulnerable to Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature when JWS or JWT signature with non Base64URL encoding special characters or number escaped characters may be validated as valid by mistake. Workaround: Validate JWS or JWT signature if it has Base64URL and dot safe string before executing JWS.verify() or JWS.verifyJWT() method.\n\n- CVE-2022-2790: Emerson Electric's Proficy Machine Edition Version 9.00 and prior is vulenrable to CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature, and does not properly verify compiled logic (PDT files) and data blocks data (BLD/BLK files).\n\n- CVE-2022-31156: Gradle is a build tool. Dependency verification is a security feature in Gradle Build Tool that was introduced to allow validation of external dependencies either through their checksum or cryptographic signatures. In versions 6.2 through 7.4.2, there are some cases in which Gradle may skip that verification and accept a dependency that would otherwise fail the build as an untrusted external artifact. This can occur in two ways. When signature verification is disabled but the verification metadata contains entries for dependencies that only have a `gpg` element but no `checksum` element. When signature verification is enabled, the verification metadata contains entries for dependencies with a `gpg` element but there is no signature file on the remote repository. In both cases, the verification will accept the dependency, skipping signature verification and not complaining that the dependency has no checksum entry. For builds that are vulnerable, there are two risks. Gradle could download a malicious binary from a repository outside your organization due to name squatting. For those still using HTTP only and not HTTPS for downloading dependencies, the build could download a malicious library instead of the expected one. Gradle 7.5 patches this issue by making sure to run checksum verification if signature verification cannot be completed, whatever the reason. Two workarounds are available: Remove all `gpg` elements from dependency verification metadata if you disable signature validation and/or avoid adding `gpg` entries for dependencies that do not have signature files.\n\n- CVE-2022-31206: The Omron SYSMAC Nx product family PLCs (NJ series, NY series, NX series, and PMAC series) through 2022-005-18 lack cryptographic authentication. These PLCs are programmed using the SYMAC Studio engineering software (which compiles IEC 61131-3 conformant POU code to native machine code for execution by the PLC's runtime). The resulting machine code is executed by a runtime, typically controlled by a real-time operating system. The logic that is downloaded to the PLC does not seem to be cryptographically authenticated, allowing an attacker to manipulate transmitted object code to the PLC and execute arbitrary machine code on the processor of the PLC's CPU module in the context of the runtime. In the case of at least the NJ series, an RTOS and hardware combination is used that would potentially allow for memory protection and privilege separation and thus limit the impact of code execution. However, it was not confirmed whether these sufficiently segment the runtime from the rest of the RTOS.\n\n- CVE-2022-31207: The Omron SYSMAC Cx product family PLCs (CS series, CJ series, and CP series) through 2022-05-18 lack cryptographic authentication. They utilize the Omron FINS (9600/TCP) protocol for engineering purposes, including downloading projects and control logic to the PLC. This protocol has authentication flaws as reported in FSCT-2022-0057. Control logic is downloaded to PLC volatile memory using the FINS Program Area Read and Program Area Write commands or to non-volatile memory using other commands from where it can be loaded into volatile memory for execution. The logic that is loaded into and executed from the user program area exists in compiled object code form. Upon execution, these object codes are first passed to a dedicated ASIC that determines whether the object code is to be executed by the ASIC or the microprocessor. In the former case, the object code is interpreted by the ASIC whereas in the latter case the object code is passed to the microprocessor for object code interpretation by a ROM interpreter. In the abnormal case where the object code cannot be handled by either, an abnormal condition is triggered and the PLC is halted. The logic that is downloaded to the PLC does not seem to be cryptographically authenticated, thus allowing an attacker to manipulate transmitted object code to the PLC and either execute arbitrary object code commands on the ASIC or on the microprocessor interpreter.\n\n- CVE-2022-34459:  Dell Command | Update, Dell Update, and Alienware Update versions prior to 4.7 contain a improper verification of cryptographic signature in get applicable driver component. A local malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to malicious payload execution. \n\n- CVE-2022-39366: DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. Prior to version 0.8.45, the `StatelessTokenService` of the DataHub metadata service (GMS) does not verify the signature of JWT tokens. This allows an attacker to connect to DataHub instances as any user if Metadata Service authentication is enabled. This vulnerability occurs because the `StatelessTokenService` of the Metadata service uses the `parse` method of `io.jsonwebtoken.JwtParser`, which does not perform a verification of the cryptographic token signature. This means that JWTs are accepted regardless of the used algorithm. This issue may lead to an authentication bypass. Version 0.8.45 contains a patch for the issue. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-41666: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists that allows adversaries with local user privileges to load a malicious DLL which could lead to execution of malicious code. Affected Products: EcoStruxure Operator Terminal Expert(V3.3 Hotfix 1 or prior), Pro-face BLUE(V3.3 Hotfix1 or prior).\n\n- CVE-2022-41669: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in the SGIUtility component that allows adversaries with local user privileges to load a malicious DLL which could result in execution of malicious code. Affected Products: EcoStruxure Operator Terminal Expert(V3.3 Hotfix 1 or prior), Pro-face BLUE(V3.3 Hotfix1 or prior).\n\n- CVE-2021-23993: An attacker may perform a DoS attack to prevent a user from sending encrypted email to a correspondent. If an attacker creates a crafted OpenPGP key with a subkey that has an invalid self signature, and the Thunderbird user imports the crafted key, then Thunderbird may try to use the invalid subkey, but the RNP library rejects it from being used, causing encryption to fail. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.9.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23540: In versions `<=8.5.1` of `jsonwebtoken` library, lack of algorithm definition in the `jwt.verify()` function can lead to signature validation bypass due to defaulting to the `none` algorithm for signature verification. Users are affected if you do not specify algorithms in the `jwt.verify()` function. This issue has been fixed, please update to version 9.0.0 which removes the default support for the none algorithm in the `jwt.verify()` method. There will be no impact, if you update to version 9.0.0 and you don\u2019t need to allow for the `none` algorithm. If you need 'none' algorithm, you have to explicitly specify that in `jwt.verify()` options. \n\n- CVE-2022-42793: An issue in code signature validation was addressed with improved checks. This issue is fixed in macOS Big Sur 11.7, macOS Ventura 13, iOS 16, iOS 15.7 and iPadOS 15.7, macOS Monterey 12.6. An app may be able to bypass code signing checks.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-345 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-345 (ChildOf)",

In CarrierWave before versions 1.3.2 and 2.1.1, there is a code injection vulnerability. The \"#manipulate!\" method inappropriately evals the content of mutation option(:read/:write), allowing attackers to craft a string that can be executed as a Ruby code. If an application developer supplies untrusted inputs to the option, it will lead to remote code execution(RCE). This is fixed in versions 1.3.2 and 2.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-27928: A remote code execution issue was discovered in MariaDB 10.2 before 10.2.37, 10.3 before 10.3.28, 10.4 before 10.4.18, and 10.5 before 10.5.9; Percona Server through 2021-03-03; and the wsrep patch through 2021-03-03 for MySQL. An untrusted search path leads to eval injection, in which a database SUPER user can execute OS commands after modifying wsrep_provider and wsrep_notify_cmd. NOTE: this does not affect an Oracle product.\n\n- CVE-2021-3725: Vulnerability in dirhistory plugin Description: the widgets that go back and forward in the directory history, triggered by pressing Alt-Left and Alt-Right, use functions that unsafely execute eval on directory names. If you cd into a directory with a carefully-crafted name, then press Alt-Left, the system is subject to command injection. Impacted areas: - Functions pop_past and pop_future in dirhistory plugin.\n\n- CVE-2021-21278: RSSHub is an open source, easy to use, and extensible RSS feed generator. In RSSHub before version 7f1c430 (non-semantic versioning) there is a risk of code injection. Some routes use `eval` or `Function constructor`, which may be injected by the target site with unsafe code, causing server-side security issues The fix in version 7f1c430 is to temporarily remove the problematic route and added a `no-new-func` rule to eslint.\n\n- CVE-2021-40084: opensysusers through 0.6 does not safely use eval on files in sysusers.d that may contain shell metacharacters. For example, it allows command execution via a crafted GECOS field whereas systemd-sysusers (a program with the same specification) does not do that.\n\n- CVE-2021-42057: Obsidian Dataview through 0.4.12-hotfix1 allows eval injection. The evalInContext function in executes user input, which allows an attacker to craft malicious Markdown files that will execute arbitrary code once opened. NOTE: 0.4.13 provides a mitigation for some use cases.\n\n- CVE-2021-32756: ManageIQ is an open-source management platform. In versions prior to jansa-4, kasparov-2, and lasker-1, there is a flaw in the MiqExpression module of ManageIQ where a low privilege user could enter a crafted Ruby string which would be evaluated. Successful exploitation will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the host system. There are patches for this issue in releases named jansa-4, kasparov-2, and lasker-1. If possible, restrict users, via RBAC, to only the part of the application that they need access to. While MiqExpression is widely used throughout the product, restricting users can limit the surface of the attack.\n\n- CVE-2020-22201: phpCMS 2008 sp4 allowas remote malicious users to execute arbitrary php commands via the pagesize parameter to yp/product.php.\n\n- CVE-2021-23344: The package total.js before 3.4.8 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via set.\n\n- CVE-2021-32924: Invision Community (aka IPS Community Suite) before 4.6.0 allows eval-based PHP code injection by a moderator because the IPS\\\\cms\\\\modules\\\\front\\\\pages\\\\_builder::previewBlock method interacts unsafely with the IPS\\\\_Theme::runProcessFunction method.\n\n- CVE-2021-41228: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions TensorFlow's `saved_model_cli` tool is vulnerable to a code injection as it calls `eval` on user supplied strings. This can be used by attackers to run arbitrary code on the plaform where the CLI tool runs. However, given that the tool is always run manually, the impact of this is not severe. We have patched this by adding a `safe` flag which defaults to `True` and an explicit warning for users. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-43281: MyBB before 1.8.29 allows Remote Code Injection by an admin with the \"Can manage settings?\" permission. The Admin CP's Settings management module does not validate setting types correctly on insertion and update, making it possible to add settings of supported type \"php\" with PHP code, executed on Change Settings pages.\n\n- CVE-2020-15591: fexsrv in F*EX (aka Frams' Fast File EXchange) before fex-20160919_2 allows eval injection (for unauthenticated remote code execution).\n\n- CVE-2021-43269: In Code42 app before 8.8.0, eval injection allows an attacker to change a device\u2019s proxy configuration to use a malicious proxy auto-config (PAC) file, leading to arbitrary code execution. This affects Incydr Basic, Advanced, and Gov F1; CrashPlan Cloud; and CrashPlan for Small Business. (Incydr Professional and Enterprise are unaffected.)\n\n- CVE-2021-23277: Eaton Intelligent Power Manager (IPM) prior to 1.69 is vulnerable to unauthenticated eval injection vulnerability. The software does not neutralize code syntax from users before using in the dynamic evaluation call in loadUserFile function under scripts/libs/utils.js. Successful exploitation can allow attackers to control the input to the function and execute attacker controlled commands.\n\n- CVE-2022-40871: Dolibarr ERP & CRM <=15.0.3 is vulnerable to Eval injection. By default, any administrator can be added to the installation page of dolibarr, and if successfully added, malicious code can be inserted into the database and then execute it by eval.\n\n- CVE-2021-22204: Improper neutralization of user data in the DjVu file format in ExifTool versions 7.44 and up allows arbitrary code execution when parsing the malicious image\n\n- CVE-2022-0845: Code Injection in GitHub repository pytorchlightning/pytorch-lightning prior to 1.6.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-29216: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, TensorFlow's `saved_model_cli` tool is vulnerable to a code injection. This can be used to open a reverse shell. This code path was maintained for compatibility reasons as the maintainers had several test cases where numpy expressions were used as arguments. However, given that the tool is always run manually, the impact of this is still not severe. The maintainers have now removed the `safe=False` argument, so all parsing is done without calling `eval`. The patch is available in versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4.\n\n- CVE-2022-32417: PbootCMS v3.1.2 was discovered to contain a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability via the function parserIfLabel at function.php.\n\n- CVE-2022-3394: The WP All Export Pro WordPress plugin before 1.7.9 does not limit some functionality during exports only to users with the Administrator role, allowing any logged in user which has been given privileges to perform exports to execute arbitrary code on the site. By default only administrators can run exports, but the privilege can be delegated to lower privileged users.\n\n- CVE-2022-38193: There is a code injection vulnerability in Esri Portal for ArcGIS versions 10.8.1 and below that may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to pass strings which could potentially cause arbitrary code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-46648: ruby-git versions prior to v1.13.0 allows a remote authenticated attacker to execute an arbitrary ruby code by having a user to load a repository containing a specially crafted filename to the product. This vulnerability is different from CVE-2022-47318.\n\n- CVE-2021-40553: piwigo 11.5.0 is affected by a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the LocalFiles Editor.\n\n- CVE-2022-2054: Code Injection in GitHub repository nuitka/nuitka prior to 0.9. \n\n- CVE-2022-45907: In PyTorch before trunk/89695, torch.jit.annotations.parse_type_line can cause arbitrary code execution because eval is used unsafely.\n\n- CVE-2022-46333: The admin user interface in Proofpoint Enterprise Protection (PPS/PoD) contains a command injection vulnerability that enables an admin to execute commands beyond their allowed scope. This affects all versions 8.19.0 and below. \n\n- CVE-2022-48175: Rukovoditel v3.2.1 was discovered to contain a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the component /rukovoditel/index.php?module=dashboard/ajax_request.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-94 (ChildOf)",

When configured to use a specific server for a given network interface, dnsmasq uses a fixed port while forwarding queries. An attacker on the network, able to find the outgoing port used by dnsmasq, only needs to guess the random transmission ID to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This flaw makes a DNS Cache Poisoning attack much easier. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-23020: The NAAS 3.x before 3.10.0 API keys were generated using an insecure pseudo-random string and hashing algorithm which could lead to predictable keys.\n\n- CVE-2021-41829: Zoho ManageEngine Remote Access Plus before 10.1.2121.1 relies on the application's build number to calculate a certain encryption key.\n\n- CVE-2021-31520: A weak session token authentication bypass vulnerability in Trend Micro IM Security 1.6 and 1.6.5 could allow an remote attacker to guess currently logged-in administrators' session session token in order to gain access to the product's web management interface.\n\n- CVE-2021-0466: In startIpClient of ClientModeImpl.java, there is a possible identifier which could be used to track a device. This could lead to remote information disclosure to a proximal attacker, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10Android ID: A-154114734\n\n- CVE-2021-24998: The Simple JWT Login WordPress plugin before 3.3.0 can be used to create new WordPress user accounts with a randomly generated password. The password is generated using the str_shuffle PHP function that \"does not generate cryptographically secure values, and should not be used for cryptographic purposes\" according to PHP's documentation.\n\n- CVE-2021-28099: In Netflix OSS Hollow, since the Files.exists(parent) is run before creating the directories, an attacker can pre-create these directories with wide permissions. Additionally, since an insecure source of randomness is used, the file names to be created can be deterministically calculated.\n\n- CVE-2022-22922: TP-Link TL-WA850RE Wi-Fi Range Extender before v6_200923 was discovered to use highly predictable and easily detectable session keys, allowing attackers to gain administrative privileges.\n\n- CVE-2022-23138: ZTE's MF297D product has cryptographic issues vulnerability. Due to the use of weak random values, the security of the device is reduced, and it may face the risk of attack.\n\n- CVE-2022-24406: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 allows SSRF because multipart/form-data boundaries are predictable, and this can lead to injection into internal Documentconverter API calls.\n\n- CVE-2022-30295: uClibc-ng through 1.0.40 and uClibc through 0.9.33.2 use predictable DNS transaction IDs that may lead to DNS cache poisoning. This is related to a reset of a value to 0x2.\n\n- CVE-2022-31157: LTI 1.3 Tool Library is a library used for building IMS-certified LTI 1.3 tool providers in PHP. Prior to version 5.0, the function used to generate random nonces was not sufficiently cryptographically complex. Users should upgrade to version 5.0 to receive a patch. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-32296: The Linux kernel before 5.17.9 allows TCP servers to identify clients by observing what source ports are used. This occurs because of use of Algorithm 4 (\"Double-Hash Port Selection Algorithm\") of RFC 6056.\n\n- CVE-2022-40299: In Singular before 4.3.1, a predictable /tmp pathname is used (e.g., by sdb.cc), which allows local users to gain the privileges of other users via a procedure in a file under /tmp. NOTE: this CVE Record is about sdb.cc and similar files in the Singular interface that have predictable /tmp pathnames; this CVE Record is not about the lack of a safe temporary-file creation capability in the Singular language.\n\n- CVE-2021-26726: A remote code execution vulnerability affecting a Valmet DNA service listening on TCP port 1517, allows an attacker to execute commands with SYSTEM privileges This issue affects: Valmet DNA versions from Collection 2012 until Collection 2021.\n\n- CVE-2021-45487: In NetBSD through 9.2, the IPv4 ID generation algorithm does not use appropriate cryptographic measures.\n\n- CVE-2021-45488: In NetBSD through 9.2, there is an information leak in the TCP ISN (ISS) generation algorithm.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-693 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-804 (CanPrecede)",

During viewing of a malicious request, it can be manipulated into issuing a request that does not respect its upstream proxy configuration. This could leak NetNTLM hashes on Windows systems that fail to block outbound SMB.\n\n- CVE-2021-30127: TerraMaster F2-210 devices through 2021-04-03 use UPnP to make the admin web server accessible over the Internet on TCP port 8181, which is arguably inconsistent with the \"It is only available on the local network\" documentation. NOTE: manually editing /etc/upnp.json provides a partial but undocumented workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31810: An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.6.7, 2.7.x through 2.7.3, and 3.x through 3.0.1. A malicious FTP server can use the PASV response to trick Net::FTP into connecting back to a given IP address and port. This potentially makes curl extract information about services that are otherwise private and not disclosed (e.g., the attacker can conduct port scans and service banner extractions).\n\n- CVE-2021-20999: In Weidm\u00fcller u-controls and IoT-Gateways in versions up to 1.12.1 a network port intended only for device-internal usage is accidentally accessible via external network interfaces. By exploiting this vulnerability the device may be manipulated or the operation may be stopped.\n\n- CVE-2021-21210: Inappropriate implementation in Network in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.72 allowed a remote attacker to potentially access local UDP ports via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-42343: An issue was discovered in the Dask distributed package before 2021.10.0 for Python. Single machine Dask clusters started with dask.distributed.LocalCluster or dask.distributed.Client (which defaults to using LocalCluster) would mistakenly configure their respective Dask workers to listen on external interfaces (typically with a randomly selected high port) rather than only on localhost. A Dask cluster created using this method (when running on a machine that has an applicable port exposed) could be used by a sophisticated attacker to achieve remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2021-22916: In Brave Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.26.60, when adblocking is enabled and a proxy browser extension is installed, the CNAME adblocking feature issues DNS requests that used the system DNS settings instead of the extension's proxy settings, resulting in possible information disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2021-22917: Brave Browser Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.20 is vulnerable to information disclosure by way of DNS requests in Tor windows not flowing through Tor if adblocking was enabled.\n\n- CVE-2020-4062: In Conjur OSS Helm Chart before 2.0.0, a recently identified critical vulnerability resulted in the installation of the Conjur Postgres database with an open port. This allows an attacker to gain full read & write access to the Conjur Postgres database, including escalating the attacker's privileges to assume full control. A malicious actor who knows the IP address and port number of the Postgres database and has access into the Kubernetes cluster where Conjur runs can gain full read & write access to the Postgres database. This enables the attacker to write a policy that allows full access to retrieve any secret. This Helm chart is a method to install Conjur OSS into a Kubernetes environment. Hence, the systems impacted are only Conjur OSS systems that were deployed using this chart. Other deployments including Docker and the CyberArk Dynamic Access Provider (DAP) are not affected. To remediate this vulnerability, clone the latest Helm Chart and follow the upgrade instructions. If you are not able to fully remediate this vulnerability immediately, you can mitigate some of the risk by making sure Conjur OSS is deployed on an isolated Kubernetes cluster or namespace. The term \"isolated\" refers to: - No other workloads besides Conjur OSS and its backend database are running in that Kubernetes cluster/namespace. - Kubernetes and helm access to the cluster/namespace is limited to security administrators via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).\n\n- CVE-2020-10087: GitLab before 12.8.2 allows Information Disclosure. Badge images were not being proxied, causing mixed content warnings as well as leaking the IP address of the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-32690: Helm is a tool for managing Charts (packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources). In versions of helm prior to 3.6.1, a vulnerability exists where the username and password credentials associated with a Helm repository could be passed on to another domain referenced by that Helm repository. This issue has been resolved in 3.6.1. There is a workaround through which one may check for improperly passed credentials. One may use a username and password for a Helm repository and may audit the Helm repository in order to check for another domain being used that could have received the credentials. In the `index.yaml` file for that repository, one may look for another domain in the `urls` list for the chart versions. If there is another domain found and that chart version was pulled or installed, the credentials would be passed on.\n\n- CVE-2021-32707: Nextcloud Mail is a mail app for Nextcloud. In versions prior to 1.9.6, the Nextcloud Mail application does not, by default, render images in emails to not leak the read state. The privacy filter failed to filter images with a `background-image` CSS attribute. Note that the images were still passed through the Nextcloud image proxy, and thus there was no IP leakage. The issue was patched in version 1.9.6 and 1.10.0. No workarounds are known to exist.\n\n- CVE-2020-14312: A flaw was found in the default configuration of dnsmasq, as shipped with Fedora versions prior to 31 and in all versions Red Hat Enterprise Linux, where it listens on any interface and accepts queries from addresses outside of its local subnet. In particular, the option `local-service` is not enabled. Running dnsmasq in this manner may inadvertently make it an open resolver accessible from any address on the internet. This flaw allows an attacker to conduct a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against other systems.\n\n- CVE-2021-20149: Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 does not have sufficient access controls for the WAN interface. The default iptables ruleset for governing access to services on the device only apply to IPv4. All services running on the devices are accessible via the WAN interface via IPv6 by default.\n\n- CVE-2020-1938: When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations.\n\n- CVE-2022-22547: Simple Diagnostics Agent - versions 1.0 (up to version 1.57.), allows an attacker to access information which would otherwise be restricted via a random port 9000-65535. This allows information gathering which could be used exploit future open-source security exploits.\n\n- CVE-2022-44784: An issue was discovered in Appalti & Contratti 9.12.2. The target web applications LFS and DL229 expose a set of services provided by the Axis 1.4 instance, embedded directly into the applications, as hinted by the WEB-INF/web.xml file leaked through Local File Inclusion. Among the exposed services, there is the Axis AdminService, which, through the default configuration, should normally be accessible only by the localhost. Nevertheless, by trying to access the mentioned service, both in LFS and DL229, the service can actually be reached even by remote users, allowing creation of arbitrary services on the server side. When an attacker can reach the AdminService, they can use it to instantiate arbitrary services on the server. The exploit procedure is well known and described in Generic AXIS-SSRF exploitation. Basically, the attack consists of writing a JSP page inside the root directory of the web application, through the org.apache.axis.handlers.LogHandler class.\n\n- CVE-2022-26834: Improper access control vulnerability in Rakuten Casa version AP_F_V1_4_1 or AP_F_V2_0_0 allows a remote attacker to obtain the information stored in the product because the product is set to accept HTTP connections from the WAN side by default.\n\n- CVE-2022-4390: A network misconfiguration is present in versions prior to 1.0.9.90 of the NETGEAR RAX30 AX2400 series of routers. IPv6 is enabled for the WAN interface by default on these devices. While there are firewall restrictions in place that define access restrictions for IPv4 traffic, these restrictions do not appear to be applied to the WAN interface for IPv6. This allows arbitrary access to any services running on the device that may be inadvertently listening via IPv6, such as the SSH and Telnet servers spawned on ports 22 and 23 by default. This misconfiguration could allow an attacker to interact with services only intended to be accessible by clients on the local network.\n\n- CVE-2022-45414: If a Thunderbird user quoted from an HTML email, for example by replying to the email, and the email contained either a VIDEO tag with the POSTER attribute or an OBJECT tag with a DATA attribute, a network request to the referenced remote URL was performed, regardless of a configuration to block remote content. An image loaded from the POSTER attribute was shown in the composer window. These issues could have given an attacker additional capabilities when targetting releases that did not yet have a fix for CVE-2022-3033 which was reported around three months ago.

NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-11736.\n\n- CVE-2021-21272: ORAS is open source software which enables a way to push OCI Artifacts to OCI Conformant registries. ORAS is both a CLI for initial testing and a Go Module. In ORAS from version 0.4.0 and before version 0.9.0, there is a \"zip-slip\" vulnerability. The directory support feature allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links and hard links. A well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who runs `oras pull`. Users of the affected versions are impacted if they are `oras` CLI users who runs `oras pull`, or if they are Go programs, which invoke `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`. The problem has been fixed in version 0.9.0. For `oras` CLI users, there is no workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider. For `oras` package users, the workaround is to not use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`, and use other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider.\n\n- CVE-2021-28650: autoar-extractor.c in GNOME gnome-autoar before 0.3.1, as used by GNOME Shell, Nautilus, and other software, allows Directory Traversal during extraction because it lacks a check of whether a file's parent is a symlink in certain complex situations. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-36241.\n\n- CVE-2021-32518: A vulnerability in share_link in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote attackers to create a symbolic link then access arbitrary files. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32803: The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.4.15, and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via insufficient symlink protection. `node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-32825: bblfshd is an open source self-hosted server for source code parsing. In bblfshd before commit 4265465b9b6fb5663c30ee43806126012066aad4 there is a \"zipslip\" vulnerability. The unsafe handling of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may enable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations outside the designated target folder. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive file. Additionally, if the attacker has read access to the unpacked files, he may be able to read arbitrary system files the parent process has permissions to read. For more details including a PoC see the referenced GHSL-2020-258.\n\n- CVE-2021-36286: Dell SupportAssist Client Consumer versions 3.9.13.0 and any versions prior to 3.9.13.0 contain an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability that can be exploited by using the Windows feature of NTFS called Symbolic links. Symbolic links can be created by any(non-privileged) user under some object directories, but by themselves are not sufficient to successfully escalate privileges. However, combining them with a different object, such as the NTFS junction point allows for the exploitation. Support assist clean files functionality do not distinguish junction points from the physical folder and proceeds to clean the target of the junction that allows nonprivileged users to create junction points and delete arbitrary files on the system which can be accessed only by the admin.\n\n- CVE-2021-38511: An issue was discovered in the tar crate before 0.4.36 for Rust. When symlinks are present in a TAR archive, extraction can create arbitrary directories via .. traversal.\n\n- CVE-2021-29136: Open Container Initiative umoci before 0.4.7 allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary host paths via a crafted image that causes symlink traversal when \"umoci unpack\" or \"umoci raw unpack\" is used.\n\n- CVE-2020-27833: A Zip Slip vulnerability was found in the oc binary in openshift-clients where an arbitrary file write is achieved by using a specially crafted raw container image (.tar file) which contains symbolic links. The vulnerability is limited to the command `oc image extract`. If a symbolic link is first created pointing within the tarball, this allows further symbolic links to bypass the existing path check. This flaw allows the tarball to create links outside the tarball's parent directory, allowing for executables or configuration files to be overwritten, resulting in arbitrary code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. Versions up to and including openshift-clients-4.7.0-202104250659.p0.git.95881af are affected.\n\n- CVE-2020-27697: Trend Micro Security 2020 (Consumer) contains a vulnerability in the installer package that could be exploited by placing a malicious DLL in a non-protected location with high privileges (symlink attack) which can lead to obtaining administrative privileges during the installation of the product.\n\n- CVE-2020-4717: A vulnerability exists in IBM SPSS Modeler Subscription Installer that allows a user with create symbolic link permission to write arbitrary file in another protected path during product installation.

It affects multi-user setups in which \u2019guix-daemon\u2019 runs locally. The attack consists in having an unprivileged user spawn a build process, for instance with `guix build`, that makes its build directory world-writable. The user then creates a hardlink to a root-owned file such as /etc/shadow in that build directory. If the user passed the --keep-failed option and the build eventually fails, the daemon changes ownership of the whole build tree, including the hardlink, to the user. At that point, the user has write access to the target file. Versions after and including v0.11.0-3298-g2608e40988, and versions prior to v1.2.0-75109-g94f0312546 are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2020-28007: Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Execution with Unnecessary Privileges.

          "matched_text": "CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions\n\nType: Base\n\nStatus: Incomplete\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product creates a temporary file in a directory whose permissions allow unintended actors to determine the file's existence or otherwise access that file.\n\nExtended Details:\n\nOn some operating systems, the fact that the temporary file exists may be apparent to any user with sufficient privileges to access that directory. Since the file is visible, the application that is using the temporary file could be known. If one has access to list the processes on the system, the attacker has gained information about what the user is doing at that time. By correlating this with the applications the user is running, an attacker could potentially discover what a user's actions are. From this, higher levels of security could be breached.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-27818: A hotkey daemon written in Rust creates a domain socket file underneath /tmp, which is accessible by any user.\n\n- CVE-2021-21290: A Java-based application for a rapid-development framework uses File.createTempFile() to create a random temporary file with insecure default permissions.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-28568: Adobe Genuine Services version 7.1 (and earlier) is affected by an Insecure file permission vulnerability during installation process. A local authenticated attacker could leverage this vulnerability to achieve privilege escalation in the context of the current user.\n\n- CVE-2021-42254: BeyondTrust Privilege Management prior to version 21.6 creates a Temporary File in a Directory with Insecure Permissions.\n\n- CVE-2021-28597: Adobe Photoshop Elements version 5.2 (and earlier) is affected by an insecure temporary file creation vulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker could leverage this vulnerability to call functions against the installer to perform high privileged actions. Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-28623: Adobe Premiere Elements version 5.2 (and earlier) is affected by an insecure temporary file creation vulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker could leverage this vulnerability to call functions against the installer to perform high privileged actions. Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-28168: Eclipse Jersey 2.28 to 2.33 and Eclipse Jersey 3.0.0 to 3.0.1 contains a local information disclosure vulnerability. This is due to the use of the File.createTempFile which creates a file inside of the system temporary directory with the permissions: -rw-r--r--. Thus the contents of this file are viewable by all other users locally on the system. As such, if the contents written is security sensitive, it can be disclosed to other local users.\n\n- CVE-2021-36002: Adobe Captivate version 11.5.5 (and earlier) is affected by an Creation of Temporary File In Directory With Incorrect Permissions vulnerability that could result in privilege escalation in the context of the current user. The attacker must plant a malicious file in a particular location of the victim's machine. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must launch the Captivate Installer.\n\n- CVE-2021-42255: AppGuard Enterprise before 6.7.100.1 creates a Temporary File in a Directory with Insecure Permissions. Local users can gain SYSTEM privileges because a repair operation relies on the %TEMP% directory of an unprivileged user.\n\n- CVE-2021-42712: Splashtop Streamer through 3.4.8.3 creates a Temporary File in a Directory with Insecure Permissions.\n\n- CVE-2021-44049: CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager (EPM) through 11.5.3.328 before 2021-12-20 allows a local user to gain elevated privileges via a Trojan horse Procmon64.exe in the user's Temp directory.\n\n- CVE-2021-41988: Qlik NPrinting Designer through 21.14.3.0 creates a Temporary File in a Directory with Insecure Permissions.\n\n- CVE-2021-41989: Qlik QlikView through 12.60.20100.0 creates a Temporary File in a Directory with Insecure Permissions.\n\n- CVE-2021-42713: Splashtop Remote Client (Personal Edition) through 3.4.6.1 creates a Temporary File in a Directory with Insecure Permissions.\n\n- CVE-2021-42714: Splashtop Remote Client (Business Edition) through 3.4.8.3 creates a Temporary File in a Directory with Insecure Permissions.\n\n- CVE-2022-21126: The package com.github.samtools:htsjdk before 3.0.1 are vulnerable to Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions due to the createTempDir() function in util/IOUtil.java not checking for the existence of the temporary directory before attempting to create it.\n\n- CVE-2022-3952: A vulnerability has been found in ManyDesigns Portofino 5.3.2 and classified as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is the function createTempDir of the file WarFileLauncher.java. The manipulation leads to creation of temporary file in directory with insecure permissions. Upgrading to version 5.3.3 is able to address this issue. The name of the patch is 94653cb357806c9cf24d8d294e6afea33f8f0775. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The identifier VDB-213457 was assigned to this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-28633: Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop Application (installer) version 2.4 (and earlier) is affected by an Insecure temporary file creation vulnerability. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to cause arbitrary file overwriting in the context of the current user. Exploitation of this issue requires physical interaction to the system.\n\n- CVE-2021-21428: Openapi generator is a java tool which allows generation of API client libraries (SDK generation), server stubs, documentation and configuration automatically given an OpenAPI Spec. openapi-generator-online creates insecure temporary folders with File.createTempFile during the code generation process. The insecure temporary folders store the auto-generated files which can be read and appended to by any users on the system. The issue has been patched with `Files.createTempFile` and released in the v5.1.0 stable version.\n\n- CVE-2022-27818: SWHKD 1.1.5 unsafely uses the /tmp/swhkd.sock pathname. There can be an information leak or denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2022-23950: In Keylime before 6.3.0, Revocation Notifier uses a fixed /tmp path for UNIX domain socket which can allow unprivileged users a method to prohibit keylime operations.\n\n- CVE-2022-23163: Dell PowerScale OneFS, 8.2,x, 9.1.0.x, 9.2.1.x, and 9.3.0.x contain a denial of service vulnerability. A local malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to denial of service/data unavailability.\n\n- CVE-2022-26850: When creating or updating credentials for single-user access, Apache NiFi wrote a copy of the Login Identity Providers configuration to the operating system temporary directory. On most platforms, the operating system temporary directory has global read permissions. NiFi immediately moved the temporary file to the final configuration directory, which significantly limited the window of opportunity for access. NiFi 1.16.0 includes updates to replace the Login Identity Providers configuration without writing a file to the operating system temporary directory.\n\n- CVE-2022-28226: Local privilege vulnerability in Yandex Browser for Windows prior to 22.3.3.801 allows a local, low privileged, attacker to execute arbitary code with the SYSTEM privileges through manipulating temporary files in directory with insecure permissions during Yandex Browser update process.\n\n- CVE-2022-41946: pgjdbc is an open source postgresql JDBC Driver. In affected versions a prepared statement using either `PreparedStatement.setText(int, InputStream)` or `PreparedStatemet.setBytea(int, InputStream)` will create a temporary file if the InputStream is larger than 2k. This will create a temporary file which is readable by other users on Unix like systems, but not MacOS. On Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. Because of this, when files and directories are written into this directory they are, by default, readable by other users on that same system. This vulnerability does not allow other users to overwrite the contents of these directories or files. This is purely an information disclosure vulnerability. Because certain JDK file system APIs were only added in JDK 1.7, this this fix is dependent upon the version of the JDK you are using. Java 1.7 and higher users: this vulnerability is fixed in 4.5.0. Java 1.6 and lower users: no patch is available. If you are unable to patch, or are stuck running on Java 1.6, specifying the java.io.tmpdir system environment variable to a directory that is exclusively owned by the executing user will mitigate this vulnerability.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-377 (ChildOf)",

            "extended_description": "\n\nCryptographic protocols and systems depend on cryptographic primitives (and associated algorithms) as their basic building blocks. Some common examples of primitives are digital signatures, one-way hash functions, ciphers, and public key cryptography; however, the notion of \"primitive\" can vary depending on point of view. See \"Terminology Notes\" for further explanation of some concepts.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives are defined to accomplish one very specific task in a precisely defined and mathematically reliable fashion. For example, suppose that for a specific cryptographic primitive (such as an encryption routine), the consensus is that the primitive can only be broken after trying out N different inputs (where the larger the value of N, the stronger the cryptography). For an encryption scheme like AES-256, one would expect N to be so large as to be infeasible to execute in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n\nIf a vulnerability is ever found that shows that one can break a cryptographic primitive in significantly less than the expected number of attempts, then that primitive is considered weakened (or sometimes in extreme cases, colloquially it is \"broken\"). As a result, anything using this cryptographic primitive would now be considered insecure or risky. Thus, even breaking or weakening a seemingly small cryptographic primitive has the potential to render the whole system vulnerable, due to its reliance on the primitive. A historical example can be found in TLS when using DES. One would colloquially call DES the cryptographic primitive for transport encryption in this version of TLS. In the past, DES was considered strong, because no weaknesses were found in it; importantly, DES has a key length of 56 bits. Trying N=2^56 keys was considered impractical for most actors. Unfortunately, attacking a system with 56-bit keys is now practical via brute force, which makes defeating DES encryption practical. It is now practical for an adversary to read any information sent under this version of TLS and use this information to attack the system. As a result, it can be claimed that this use of TLS is weak, and that any system depending on TLS with DES could potentially render the entire system vulnerable to attack.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are only considered safe after extensive research and review from experienced cryptographers from academia, industry, and government entities looking for any possible flaws. Furthermore, cryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are frequently reevaluated for safety when new mathematical and attack techniques are discovered. As a result and over time, even well-known cryptographic primitives can lose their compliance status with the discovery of novel attacks that might either defeat the algorithm or reduce its robustness significantly.\n\n\nIf ad-hoc cryptographic primitives are implemented, it is almost certain that the implementation will be vulnerable to attacks that are well understood by cryptographers, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information and other consequences.\n\n\nThis weakness is even more difficult to manage for hardware-implemented deployment of cryptographic algorithms. First, because hardware is not patchable as easily as software, any flaw discovered after release and production typically cannot be fixed without a recall of the product. Secondly, the hardware product is often expected to work for years, during which time computation power available to the attacker only increases. Therefore, for hardware implementations of cryptographic primitives, it is absolutely essential that only strong, proven cryptographic primitives are used.\n",

While the output is, in many cases, sufficient for cryptographic uses, the output of any PRNG is directly determined by the seed provided as input. If the seed can be ascertained by a third party, the entire output of the PRNG can be made known to them. As such, the seed should be kept secret and should ideally not be able to be guessed. For example, the current time may be a poor seed. Knowing the approximate time the PRNG was seeded greatly reduces the possible key space. \n\n Seeds do not necessarily need to be unique, but reusing seeds may open up attacks if the seed is discovered. \n",

Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.\n\n\nIt is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.\n\n\nSince the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered \"unsafe\" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.\n\n\nFor a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.\n",

              "extended_description": "\n\nCryptographic protocols and systems depend on cryptographic primitives (and associated algorithms) as their basic building blocks. Some common examples of primitives are digital signatures, one-way hash functions, ciphers, and public key cryptography; however, the notion of \"primitive\" can vary depending on point of view. See \"Terminology Notes\" for further explanation of some concepts.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives are defined to accomplish one very specific task in a precisely defined and mathematically reliable fashion. For example, suppose that for a specific cryptographic primitive (such as an encryption routine), the consensus is that the primitive can only be broken after trying out N different inputs (where the larger the value of N, the stronger the cryptography). For an encryption scheme like AES-256, one would expect N to be so large as to be infeasible to execute in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n\nIf a vulnerability is ever found that shows that one can break a cryptographic primitive in significantly less than the expected number of attempts, then that primitive is considered weakened (or sometimes in extreme cases, colloquially it is \"broken\"). As a result, anything using this cryptographic primitive would now be considered insecure or risky. Thus, even breaking or weakening a seemingly small cryptographic primitive has the potential to render the whole system vulnerable, due to its reliance on the primitive. A historical example can be found in TLS when using DES. One would colloquially call DES the cryptographic primitive for transport encryption in this version of TLS. In the past, DES was considered strong, because no weaknesses were found in it; importantly, DES has a key length of 56 bits. Trying N=2^56 keys was considered impractical for most actors. Unfortunately, attacking a system with 56-bit keys is now practical via brute force, which makes defeating DES encryption practical. It is now practical for an adversary to read any information sent under this version of TLS and use this information to attack the system. As a result, it can be claimed that this use of TLS is weak, and that any system depending on TLS with DES could potentially render the entire system vulnerable to attack.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are only considered safe after extensive research and review from experienced cryptographers from academia, industry, and government entities looking for any possible flaws. Furthermore, cryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are frequently reevaluated for safety when new mathematical and attack techniques are discovered. As a result and over time, even well-known cryptographic primitives can lose their compliance status with the discovery of novel attacks that might either defeat the algorithm or reduce its robustness significantly.\n\n\nIf ad-hoc cryptographic primitives are implemented, it is almost certain that the implementation will be vulnerable to attacks that are well understood by cryptographers, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information and other consequences.\n\n\nThis weakness is even more difficult to manage for hardware-implemented deployment of cryptographic algorithms. First, because hardware is not patchable as easily as software, any flaw discovered after release and production typically cannot be fixed without a recall of the product. Secondly, the hardware product is often expected to work for years, during which time computation power available to the attacker only increases. Therefore, for hardware implementations of cryptographic primitives, it is absolutely essential that only strong, proven cryptographic primitives are used.\n",

While the output is, in many cases, sufficient for cryptographic uses, the output of any PRNG is directly determined by the seed provided as input. If the seed can be ascertained by a third party, the entire output of the PRNG can be made known to them. As such, the seed should be kept secret and should ideally not be able to be guessed. For example, the current time may be a poor seed. Knowing the approximate time the PRNG was seeded greatly reduces the possible key space. \n\n Seeds do not necessarily need to be unique, but reusing seeds may open up attacks if the seed is discovered. \n",

              "extended_description": "\n\nCryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.\n\n\nIt is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.\n\n\nSince the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered \"unsafe\" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.\n\n\nFor a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.\n",

Sometimes a mediocre source of randomness is sufficient or preferable for algorithms that use random numbers. Weak generators generally take less processing power and/or do not use the precious, finite, entropy sources on a system. While such PRNGs might have very useful features, these same features could be used to break the cryptography.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-3692: PHP framework uses mt_rand() function (Marsenne Twister) when generating tokens\n\n- CVE-2009-3278: Crypto product uses rand() library function to generate a recovery key, making it easier to conduct brute force attacks.\n\n- CVE-2009-3238: Random number generator can repeatedly generate the same value.\n\n- CVE-2009-2367: Web application generates predictable session IDs, allowing session hijacking.\n\n- CVE-2008-0166: SSL library uses a weak random number generator that only generates 65,536 unique keys.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-34430: Eclipse TinyDTLS through 0.9-rc1 relies on the rand function in the C library, which makes it easier for remote attackers to compute the master key and then decrypt DTLS traffic.\n\n- CVE-2021-43799: Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool. Zulip Server installs RabbitMQ for internal message passing. In versions of Zulip Server prior to 4.9, the initial installation (until first reboot, or restart of RabbitMQ) does not successfully limit the default ports which RabbitMQ opens; this includes port 25672, the RabbitMQ distribution port, which is used as a management port. RabbitMQ's default \"cookie\" which protects this port is generated using a weak PRNG, which limits the entropy of the password to at most 36 bits; in practicality, the seed for the randomizer is biased, resulting in approximately 20 bits of entropy. If other firewalls (at the OS or network level) do not protect port 25672, a remote attacker can brute-force the 20 bits of entropy in the \"cookie\" and leverage it for arbitrary execution of code as the rabbitmq user. They can also read all data which is sent through RabbitMQ, which includes all message traffic sent by users. Version 4.9 contains a patch for this vulnerability. As a workaround, ensure that firewalls prevent access to ports 5672 and 25672 from outside the Zulip server.\n\n- CVE-2021-45484: In NetBSD through 9.2, the IPv6 fragment ID generation algorithm employs a weak cryptographic PRNG.\n\n- CVE-2021-45489: In NetBSD through 9.2, the IPv6 Flow Label generation algorithm employs a weak cryptographic PRNG.\n\n- CVE-2022-29245: SSH.NET is a Secure Shell (SSH) library for .NET. In versions 2020.0.0 and 2020.0.1, during an `X25519` key exchange, the client\u2019s private key is generated with `System.Random`. `System.Random` is not a cryptographically secure random number generator, it must therefore not be used for cryptographic purposes. When establishing an SSH connection to a remote host, during the X25519 key exchange, the private key is generated with a weak random number generator whose seed can be brute forced. This allows an attacker who is able to eavesdrop on the communications to decrypt them. Version 2020.0.2 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, one may disable support for `curve25519-sha256` and `curve25519-sha256@libssh.org` key exchange algorithms.\n\n- CVE-2022-45782: An issue was discovered in dotCMS core 5.3.8.5 through 5.3.8.15 and 21.03 through 22.10.1.

They rely on cryptographically secure and unique seeds for entropy so proper seeding is critical to the secure operation of the PRNG.\n\n\n Management of seeds could be broken down into two main areas: \n\n\n  -  (1) protecting seeds as cryptographic material (such as a cryptographic key); \n\n  -  (2) whenever possible, using a uniquely generated seed from a cryptographically secure source \n\n PRNGs require a seed as input to generate a stream of numbers that are functionally indistinguishable from random numbers. While the output is, in many cases, sufficient for cryptographic uses, the output of any PRNG is directly determined by the seed provided as input. If the seed can be ascertained by a third party, the entire output of the PRNG can be made known to them. As such, the seed should be kept secret and should ideally not be able to be guessed. For example, the current time may be a poor seed. Knowing the approximate time the PRNG was seeded greatly reduces the possible key space. \n\n Seeds do not necessarily need to be unique, but reusing seeds may open up attacks if the seed is discovered. \n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-7010: Cloud application on Kubernetes generates passwords using a weak random number generator based on deployment time.\n\n- CVE-2019-11495: server uses erlang:now() to seed the PRNG, which results in a small search space for potential random seeds\n\n- CVE-2018-12520: Product's PRNG is not seeded for the generation of session IDs\n\n- CVE-2016-10180: Router's PIN generation is based on rand(time(0)) seeding.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-27211: steghide 0.5.1 relies on a certain 32-bit seed value, which makes it easier for attackers to detect hidden data.\n\n- CVE-2021-34600: Telenot CompasX versions prior to 32.0 use a weak seed for random number generation leading to predictable AES keys used in the NFC tags used for local authorization of users. This may lead to total loss of trustworthiness of the installation. \n\n- CVE-2021-41117: keypair is a a RSA PEM key generator written in javascript. keypair implements a lot of cryptographic primitives on its own or by borrowing from other libraries where possible, including node-forge. An issue was discovered where this library was generating identical RSA keys used in SSH. This would mean that the library is generating identical P, Q (and thus N) values which, in practical terms, is impossible with RSA-2048 keys. Generating identical values, repeatedly, usually indicates an issue with poor random number generation, or, poor handling of CSPRNG output. Issue 1: Poor random number generation (`GHSL-2021-1012`). The library does not rely entirely on a platform provided CSPRNG, rather, it uses it's own counter-based CMAC approach. Where things go wrong is seeding the CMAC implementation with \"true\" random data in the function `defaultSeedFile`. In order to seed the AES-CMAC generator, the library will take two different approaches depending on the JavaScript execution environment. In a browser, the library will use [`window.crypto.getRandomValues()`](https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/blob/87c62f255baa12c1ec4f98a91600f82af80be6db/index.js#L971). However, in a nodeJS execution environment, the `window` object is not defined, so it goes down a much less secure solution, also of which has a bug in it. It does look like the library tries to use node's CSPRNG when possible unfortunately, it looks like the `crypto` object is null because a variable was declared with the same name, and set to `null`. So the node CSPRNG path is never taken. However, when `window.crypto.getRandomValues()` is not available, a Lehmer LCG random number generator is used to seed the CMAC counter, and the LCG is seeded with `Math.random`. While this is poor and would likely qualify in a security bug in itself, it does not explain the extreme frequency in which duplicate keys occur. The main flaw: The output from the Lehmer LCG is encoded incorrectly. The specific [line][https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/blob/87c62f255baa12c1ec4f98a91600f82af80be6db/index.js#L1008] with the flaw is: `b.putByte(String.fromCharCode(next & 0xFF))` The [definition](https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/blob/87c62f255baa12c1ec4f98a91600f82af80be6db/index.js#L350-L352) of `putByte` is `util.ByteBuffer.prototype.putByte = function(b) {this.data += String.fromCharCode(b);};`. Simplified, this is `String.fromCharCode(String.fromCharCode(next & 0xFF))`. The double `String.fromCharCode` is almost certainly unintentional and the source of weak seeding. Unfortunately, this does not result in an error. Rather, it results most of the buffer containing zeros. Since we are masking with 0xFF, we can determine that 97% of the output from the LCG are converted to zeros. The only outputs that result in meaningful values are outputs 48 through 57, inclusive. The impact is that each byte in the RNG seed has a 97% chance of being 0 due to incorrect conversion. When it is not, the bytes are 0 through 9. In summary, there are three immediate concerns: 1. The library has an insecure random number fallback path. Ideally the library would require a strong CSPRNG instead of attempting to use a LCG and `Math.random`. 2. The library does not correctly use a strong random number generator when run in NodeJS, even though a strong CSPRNG is available. 3. The fallback path has an issue in the implementation where a majority of the seed data is going to effectively be zero. Due to the poor random number generation, keypair generates RSA keys that are relatively easy to guess. This could enable an attacker to decrypt confidential messages or gain authorized access to an account belonging to the victim.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-330 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-330 (ChildOf)",

It is important to fix because this creates a static nonce and since aes-gcm is a stream cipher, this can lead to known cryptographic issues, since the same key is being reused. From 2.4.9 onwards this has been patched to use dynamic values through usage of cjose AES encryption routines.\n\n- CVE-2020-1472: An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when an attacker establishes a vulnerable Netlogon secure channel connection to a domain controller, using the Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC). An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run a specially crafted application on a device on the network. To exploit the vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker would be required to use MS-NRPC to connect to a domain controller to obtain domain administrator access. Microsoft is addressing the vulnerability in a phased two-part rollout. These updates address the vulnerability by modifying how Netlogon handles the usage of Netlogon secure channels. For guidelines on how to manage the changes required for this vulnerability and more information on the phased rollout, see How to manage the changes in Netlogon secure channel connections associated with CVE-2020-1472 (updated September 28, 2020).

Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.\n\n\nIt is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.\n\n\nSince the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered \"unsafe\" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.\n\n\nFor a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-30273: SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity\n\n- CVE-2022-30320: Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.\n\n- CVE-2008-3775: Product uses \"ROT-25\" to obfuscate the password in the registry.\n\n- CVE-2007-4150: product only uses \"XOR\" to obfuscate sensitive data\n\n- CVE-2007-5460: product only uses \"XOR\" and a fixed key to obfuscate sensitive data\n\n- CVE-2005-4860: Product substitutes characters with other characters in a fixed way, and also leaves certain input characters unchanged.\n\n- CVE-2002-2058: Attackers can infer private IP addresses by dividing each octet by the MD5 hash of '20'.\n\n- CVE-2008-3188: Product uses DES when MD5 has been specified in the configuration, resulting in weaker-than-expected password hashes.\n\n- CVE-2005-2946: Default configuration of product uses MD5 instead of stronger algorithms that are available, simplifying forgery of certificates.\n\n- CVE-2007-6013: Product uses the hash of a hash for authentication, allowing attackers to gain privileges if they can obtain the original hash.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-15128: In OctoberCMS before version 1.0.468, encrypted cookie values were not tied to the name of the cookie the value belonged to. This meant that certain classes of attacks that took advantage of other theoretical vulnerabilities in user facing code (nothing exploitable in the core project itself) had a higher chance of succeeding. Specifically, if your usage exposed a way for users to provide unfiltered user input and have it returned to them as an encrypted cookie (ex. storing a user provided search query in a cookie) they could then use the generated cookie in place of other more tightly controlled cookies; or if your usage exposed the plaintext version of an encrypted cookie at any point to the user they could theoretically provide encrypted content from your application back to it as an encrypted cookie and force the framework to decrypt it for them. Issue has been fixed in build 468 (v1.0.468).\n\n- CVE-2020-4965: IBM Jazz Team Server products use weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms that could allow an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information.

An attacker may realistically have enough information that the number of possible keys (for a credential file) is only one, and the number is usually not higher than 2^36.\n\n- CVE-2020-24587: The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that all fragments of a frame are encrypted under the same key. An adversary can abuse this to decrypt selected fragments when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP encryption key is periodically renewed.\n\n- CVE-2020-24588: The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames (which is mandatory as part of 802.11n), an adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets.\n\n- CVE-2020-26140: An issue was discovered in the ALFA Windows 10 driver 6.1316.1209 for AWUS036H. The WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations accept plaintext frames in a protected Wi-Fi network.

A remote attacker with read and write access to network data could exploit this vulnerability to display plaintext bits from a block of ciphertext and obtain sensitive information. This issue affects all Juniper Networks SRC Series versions prior to 4.13.0-R6.\n\n- CVE-2021-36298: Dell EMC InsightIQ, versions prior to 4.1.4, contain risky cryptographic algorithms in the SSH component. A remote unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to authentication bypass and remote takeover of the InsightIQ. This allows an attacker to take complete control of InsightIQ to affect services provided by SSH; so Dell recommends customers to upgrade at the earliest opportunity.\n\n- CVE-2021-41263: rails_multisite provides multi-db support for Rails applications. In affected versions this vulnerability impacts any Rails applications using `rails_multisite` alongside Rails' signed/encrypted cookies. Depending on how the application makes use of these cookies, it may be possible for an attacker to re-use cookies on different 'sites' within a multi-site Rails application. The issue has been patched in v4 of the `rails_multisite` gem. Note that this upgrade will invalidate all previous signed/encrypted cookies. The impact of this invalidation will vary based on the application architecture.\n\n- CVE-2021-32001: K3s in SUSE Rancher allows any user with direct access to the datastore, or a copy of a datastore backup, to extract the cluster's confidential keying material (cluster certificate authority private keys, secrets encryption configuration passphrase, etc.) and decrypt it, without having to know the token value. This issue affects: SUSE Rancher K3s version v1.19.12+k3s1, v1.20.8+k3s1, v1.21.2+k3s1 and prior versions; RKE2 version v1.19.12+rke2r1, v1.20.8+rke2r1, v1.21.2+rke2r1 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2020-36315: In RELIC before 2020-08-01, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature forgery can occur because certain checks of the padding (and of the first two bytes) are inadequate. NOTE: this requires that a low public exponent (such as 3) is being used. The product, by default, does not generate RSA keys with such a low number.\n\n- CVE-2021-40006: Vulnerability of design defects in the security algorithm component. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect confidentiality. \n\n- CVE-2021-38542: Apache James prior to release 3.6.1 is vulnerable to a buffering attack relying on the use of the STARTTLS command. This can result in Man-in -the-middle command injection attacks, leading potentially to leakage of sensible information.\n\n- CVE-2021-43808: Laravel is a web application framework. Laravel prior to versions 8.75.0, 7.30.6, and 6.20.42 contain a possible cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Blade templating engine. A broken HTML element may be clicked and the user taken to another location in their browser due to XSS. This is due to the user being able to guess the parent placeholder SHA-1 hash by trying common names of sections. If the parent template contains an exploitable HTML structure an XSS vulnerability can be exposed. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 8.75.0, 7.30.6, and 6.20.42 by determining the parent placeholder at runtime and using a random hash that is unique to each request.\n\n- CVE-2021-31562: The SSL/TLS configuration of Fresenius Kabi Agilia Link + version 3.0 has serious deficiencies that may allow an attacker to compromise SSL/TLS sessions in different ways. An attacker may be able to eavesdrop on transferred data, manipulate data allegedly secured by SSL/TLS, and impersonate an entity to gain access to sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-2351: Vulnerability in the Advanced Networking Option component of Oracle Database Server. Supported versions that are affected are 12.1.0.2, 12.2.0.1 and 19c. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via Oracle Net to compromise Advanced Networking Option. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Advanced Networking Option, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Advanced Networking Option. Note: The July 2021 Critical Patch Update introduces a number of Native Network Encryption changes to deal with vulnerability CVE-2021-2351 and prevent the use of weaker ciphers. Customers should review: \"Changes in Native Network Encryption with the July 2021 Critical Patch Update\" (Doc ID 2791571.1). CVSS 3.1 Base Score 8.3 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n\n- CVE-2021-37588: In Charm 0.43, any two users can collude to achieve the ability to decrypt YCT14 data.\n\n- CVE-2021-43774: A risky-algorithm issue was discovered on Fujifilm DocuCentre-VI C4471 1.8 devices. An attacker that obtained access to the administrative web interface of a printer (e.g., by using the default credentials) can download the address book file, which contains the list of users (domain users, FTP users, etc.) stored on the printer, together with their encrypted passwords. The passwords are protected by a weak cipher, such as ROT13, which requires minimal effort to instantly retrieve the original password, giving the attacker a list of valid domain or FTP usernames and passwords.\n\n- CVE-2021-43989: mySCADA myPRO Versions 8.20.0 and prior stores passwords using MD5, which may allow an attacker to crack the previously retrieved password hashes.\n\n- CVE-2021-45512: Certain NETGEAR devices are affected by weak cryptography. This affects D7000v2 before 1.0.0.62, D8500 before 1.0.3.50, EX3700 before 1.0.0.84, EX3800 before 1.0.0.84, EX6120 before 1.0.0.54, EX6130 before 1.0.0.36, EX7000 before 1.0.1.90, R6250 before 1.0.4.42, R6400v2 before 1.0.4.98, R6700v3 before 1.0.4.98, R6900P before 1.3.2.124, R7000 before 1.0.11.106, R7000P before 1.3.2.124, R7100LG before 1.0.0.56, R7900 before 1.0.4.26, R8000 before 1.0.4.58, R8300 before 1.0.2.134, R8500 before 1.0.2.134, RS400 before 1.5.0.48, WNR3500Lv2 before 1.2.0.62, and XR300 before 1.0.3.50.\n\n- CVE-2021-45696: An issue was discovered in the sha2 crate 0.9.7 before 0.9.8 for Rust. Hashes of long messages may be incorrect when the AVX2-accelerated backend is used.\n\n- CVE-2022-0377: Users of the LearnPress WordPress plugin before 4.1.5 can upload an image as a profile avatar after the registration. After this process the user crops and saves the image. Then a \"POST\" request that contains user supplied name of the image is sent to the server for renaming and cropping of the image. As a result of this request, the name of the user-supplied image is changed with a MD5 value. This process can be conducted only when type of the image is JPG or PNG. An attacker can use this vulnerability in order to rename an arbitrary image file. By doing this, they could destroy the design of the web site.\n\n- CVE-2022-1252: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm in GitHub repository gnuboard/gnuboard5 prior to and including 5.5.5. A vulnerability in gnuboard v5.5.5 and below uses weak encryption algorithms leading to sensitive information exposure. This allows an attacker to derive the email address of any user, including when the 'Let others see my information.' box is ticked off. Or to send emails to any email address, with full control of its contents \n\n- CVE-2022-1434: The OpenSSL 3.0 implementation of the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite incorrectly uses the AAD data as the MAC key. This makes the MAC key trivially predictable. An attacker could exploit this issue by performing a man-in-the-middle attack to modify data being sent from one endpoint to an OpenSSL 3.0 recipient such that the modified data would still pass the MAC integrity check. Note that data sent from an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will always be rejected by the recipient and the connection will fail at that point. Many application protocols require data to be sent from the client to the server first. Therefore, in such a case, only an OpenSSL 3.0 server would be impacted when talking to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 client. If both endpoints are OpenSSL 3.0 then the attacker could modify data being sent in both directions. In this case both clients and servers could be affected, regardless of the application protocol. Note that in the absence of an attacker this bug means that an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint communicating with a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will fail to complete the handshake when using this ciphersuite. The confidentiality of data is not impacted by this issue, i.e. an attacker cannot decrypt data that has been encrypted using this ciphersuite - they can only modify it. In order for this attack to work both endpoints must legitimately negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite. This ciphersuite is not compiled by default in OpenSSL 3.0, and is not available within the default provider or the default ciphersuite list. This ciphersuite will never be used if TLSv1.3 has been negotiated. In order for an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to use this ciphersuite the following must have occurred: 1) OpenSSL must have been compiled with the (non-default) compile time option enable-weak-ssl-ciphers 2) OpenSSL must have had the legacy provider explicitly loaded (either through application code or via configuration) 3) The ciphersuite must have been explicitly added to the ciphersuite list 4) The libssl security level must have been set to 0 (default is 1) 5) A version of SSL/TLS below TLSv1.3 must have been negotiated 6) Both endpoints must negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite in preference to any others that both endpoints have in common Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2).\n\n- CVE-2022-20805: A vulnerability in the automatic decryption process in Cisco Umbrella Secure Web Gateway (SWG) could allow an authenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass the SSL decryption and content filtering policies on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to how the decryption function uses the TLS Sever Name Indication (SNI) extension of an HTTP request to discover the destination domain and determine if the request needs to be decrypted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request over TLS from a client to an unknown or controlled URL. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to bypass the decryption process of Cisco Umbrella SWG and allow malicious content to be downloaded to a host on a protected network. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-2097: AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimised implementation will not encrypt the entirety of the data under some circumstances. This could reveal sixteen bytes of data that was preexisting in the memory that wasn't written. In the special case of \"in place\" encryption, sixteen bytes of the plaintext would be revealed. Since OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and DTLS, they are both unaffected. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.5 (Affected 3.0.0-3.0.4). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1q (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1p).\n\n- CVE-2022-2781: In affected versions of Octopus Server it was identified that the same encryption process was used for both encrypting session cookies and variables.\n\n- CVE-2022-28164: Brocade SANnav before SANnav 2.2.0 application uses the Blowfish symmetric encryption algorithm for the storage of passwords. This could allow an authenticated attacker to decrypt stored account passwords.\n\n- CVE-2022-28382: An issue was discovered in certain Verbatim drives through 2022-03-31. Due to the use of an insecure encryption AES mode (Electronic Codebook, aka ECB), an attacker may be able to extract information even from encrypted data, for example by observing repeating byte patterns. The firmware of the USB-to-SATA bridge controller INIC-3637EN uses AES-256 with the ECB mode. This operation mode of block ciphers (e.g., AES) always encrypts identical plaintext data, in this case blocks of 16 bytes, to identical ciphertext data. For some data, for instance bitmap images, the lack of the cryptographic property called diffusion, within ECB, can leak sensitive information even in encrypted data. Thus, the use of the ECB operation mode can put the confidentiality of specific information at risk, even in an encrypted form. This affects Keypad Secure USB 3.2 Gen 1 Drive Part Number #49428, Store 'n' Go Secure Portable HDD GD25LK01-3637-C VER4.0, Executive Fingerprint Secure SSD GDMSFE01-INI3637-C VER1.1, and Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive Part Number #53650.\n\n- CVE-2022-29960: Emerson OpenBSI through 2022-04-29 uses weak cryptography. It is an engineering environment for the ControlWave and Bristol Babcock line of RTUs. DES with hardcoded cryptographic keys is used for protection of certain system credentials, engineering files, and sensitive utilities.\n\n- CVE-2022-30320: Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD through 2022-05-06 uses a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm. According to FSCT-2022-0063, there is a Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD S-Bus weak credential hashing scheme issue. The affected components are characterized as: S-Bus (5050/UDP) authentication. The potential impact is: Authentication bypass. The Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD controllers utilize the S-Bus protocol (5050/UDP) for a variety of engineering purposes. It is possible to configure a password in order to restrict access to sensitive engineering functionality. Authentication is done by using the S-Bus 'write byte' message to a specific address and supplying a hashed version of the password. The hashing algorithm used is based on CRC-16 and as such not cryptographically secure. An insecure hashing algorithm is used. An attacker capable of passively observing traffic can intercept the hashed credentials and trivially find collisions allowing for authentication without having to bruteforce a keyspace defined by the actual strength of the password. This allows the attacker access to sensitive engineering functionality such as uploading/downloading control logic and manipulating controller configuration.\n\n- CVE-2022-35513: The Blink1Control2 application <= 2.2.7 uses weak password encryption and an insecure method of storage.\n\n- CVE-2022-38493: Rhonabwy 0.9.99 through 1.1.x before 1.1.7 doesn't check the RSA private key length before RSA-OAEP decryption. This allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service via a crafted JWE (JSON Web Encryption) token.\n\n- CVE-2022-39237: syslabs/sif is the Singularity Image Format (SIF) reference implementation. In versions prior to 2.8.1the `github.com/sylabs/sif/v2/pkg/integrity` package did not verify that the hash algorithm(s) used are cryptographically secure when verifying digital signatures. A patch is available in version >= v2.8.1 of the module. Users are encouraged to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may independently validate that the hash algorithm(s) used for metadata digest(s) and signature hash are cryptographically secure.\n\n- CVE-2022-28166: In Brocade SANnav version before SANN2.2.0.2 and Brocade SANNav before 2.1.1.8, the implementation of TLS/SSL Server Supports the Use of Static Key Ciphers (ssl-static-key-ciphers) on ports 443 & 18082.\n\n- CVE-2022-30187: Azure Storage Library Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-23839: OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate SSLv2 with a server that is configured to support both SSLv2 and more recent SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version rollback attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or TLS versions greater than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form of padding. A server that supports greater than SSLv2 is supposed to reject connection attempts from a client where this special form of padding is present, because this indicates that a version rollback has occurred (i.e. both client and server support greater than SSLv2, and yet this is the version that is being requested). The implementation of this padding check inverted the logic so that the connection attempt is accepted if the padding is present, and rejected if it is absent. This means that such as server will accept a connection if a version rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously reject a connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made. Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x are affected by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1) have configured SSLv2 support at compile time (this is off by default), 2) have configured SSLv2 support at runtime (this is off by default), 3) have configured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default ciphersuite list) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore is not vulnerable to this issue. The underlying error is in the implementation of the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function. This also affects the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. Although 1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function still exists, as does the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode. Applications that directly call that function or use that padding mode will encounter this issue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1 this is considered a bug and not a security issue in that version. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2s-1.0.2x).\n\n- CVE-2021-20379: IBM Guardium Data Encryption (GDE) 3.0.0.3 and 4.0.0.4 uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms that could allow an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information.

NTPsec 1.2.0 allows ntpkeygen to generate keys with '#' characters. ntpd then either pads, shortens the key, or fails to load these keys entirely, depending on the key type and the placement of the '#'. This results in the administrator not being able to use the keys as expected or the keys are shorter than expected and easier to brute-force, possibly resulting in MITM attacks between ntp clients and ntp servers. For short AES128 keys, ntpd generates a warning that it is padding them.\n\n- CVE-2021-22356: There is a weak secure algorithm vulnerability in Huawei products.

In affected versions broken encryption in app-functions-sdk \u201cAES\u201d transform in EdgeX Foundry releases prior to Jakarta allows attackers to decrypt messages via unspecified vectors. The app-functions-sdk exports an \u201caes\u201d transform that user scripts can optionally call to encrypt data in the processing pipeline. No decrypt function is provided. Encryption is not enabled by default, but if used, the level of protection may be less than the user may expects due to a broken implementation. Version v2.1.0 (EdgeX Foundry Jakarta release and later) of app-functions-sdk-go/v2 deprecates the \u201caes\u201d transform and provides an improved \u201caes256\u201d transform in its place. The broken implementation will remain in a deprecated state until it is removed in the next EdgeX major release to avoid breakage of existing software that depends on the broken implementation. As the broken transform is a library function that is not invoked by default, users who do not use the AES transform in their processing pipelines are unaffected. Those that are affected are urged to upgrade to the Jakarta EdgeX release and modify processing pipelines to use the new \"aes256\" transform.\n\n- CVE-2021-42583: A Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm exists in Max Mazurov Maddy before 0.5.2, which is an unnecessary risk that may result in the exposure of sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-43550: The use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm is an unnecessary risk that may result in the exposure of sensitive information, which affects the communications between Patient Information Center iX (PIC iX) Versions C.02 and C.03 and Efficia CM Series Revisions A.01 to C.0x and 4.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-20117: In (TBD) of (TBD), there is a possible way to decrypt local data encrypted by the GSC due to improperly used crypto.

However, when these credentials are easily predictable or even fixed (as with default or hard-coded passwords and keys), then the attacker can defeat the mechanism without relying on brute force.\n\n\nCredentials may be weak for different reasons, such as:\n\n\n  - Hard-coded (i.e., static and unchangeable by the administrator)\n\n  - Default (i.e., the same static value across different deployments/installations, but able to be changed by the administrator)\n\n  - Predictable (i.e., generated in a way that produces unique credentials across deployments/installations, but can still be guessed with reasonable efficiency)\n\nEven if a new, unique credential is intended to be generated for each product installation, if the generation is predictable, then that may also simplify guessing attacks.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- [REF-1374]: Chain: JavaScript-based cryptocurrency library can fall back to the insecure Math.random() function instead of reporting a failure (CWE-392), thus reducing the entropy (CWE-332) and leading to generation of non-unique cryptographic keys for Bitcoin wallets (CWE-1391)\n\n- CVE-2022-30270: Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses default credentials for some SSH accounts\n\n- CVE-2022-29965: Distributed Control System (DCS) uses a deterministic algorithm to generate utility passwords\n\n- CVE-2022-30271: Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used in typical deployments\n\n- CVE-2021-38759: microcontroller board has default password, allowing admin access\n\n- CVE-2021-41192: data visualization/sharing package uses default secret keys or cookie values if they are not specified in environment variables\n\n- CVE-2020-8994: UART interface for AI speaker uses empty password for root shell\n\n- CVE-2020-27020: password manager does not generate cryptographically strong passwords, allowing prediction of passwords using guessable details such as time of generation\n\n- CVE-2020-8632: password generator for cloud application has small length value, making it easier for brute-force guessing\n\n- CVE-2020-5365: network-attached storage (NAS) system has predictable default passwords for a diagnostics/support account\n\n- CVE-2020-5248: IT asset management app has a default encryption key that is the same across installations\n\n- CVE-2018-3825: cloud cluster management product has a default master encryption key\n\n- CVE-2012-3503: Installation script has a hard-coded secret token value, allowing attackers to bypass authentication\n\n- CVE-2010-2306: Intrusion Detection System (IDS) uses the same static, private SSL keys for multiple devices and installations, allowing decryption of SSL traffic\n\n- CVE-2001-0618: Residential gateway uses the last 5 digits of the 'Network Name' or SSID as the default WEP key, which allows attackers to get the key by sniffing the SSID, which is sent in the clear\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-3875: A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Click Studios Passwordstate and Passwordstate Browser Extension Chrome. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the component API. The manipulation leads to authentication bypass by assumed-immutable data. The attack can be initiated remotely.

Versions prior to 2022.11.4 and 2022.10.4 are vulnerable to Improper Authentication. Token reuse in invitation URLs leads to access control bypass via the use of a different enrollment flow than in the one provided. The vulnerability allows an attacker that knows different invitation flows names (e.g. `enrollment-invitation-test` and `enrollment-invitation-admin`) via either different invite links or via brute forcing to signup via a single invitation url for any valid invite link received (it can even be a url for a third flow as long as it's a valid invite) as the token used in the `Invitations` section of the Admin interface does NOT change when a different `enrollment flow` is selected via the interface and it is NOT bound to the selected flow, so it will be valid for any flow when used. This issue is patched in authentik 2022.11.4,2022.10.4 and 2022.12.0. Only configurations that use invitations and have multiple enrollment flows with invitation stages that grant different permissions are affected. The default configuration is not vulnerable, and neither are configurations with a single enrollment flow. As a workaround, fixed data can be added to invitations which can be checked in the flow to deny requests. Alternatively, an identifier with high entropy (like a UUID) can be used as flow slug, mitigating the attack vector by exponentially decreasing the possibility of discovering other flows.\n\n- CVE-2022-28376: Verizon 5G Home LVSKIHP outside devices through 2022-02-15 allow anyone (knowing the device's serial number) to access a CPE admin website, e.g., at the 10.0.0.1 IP address. The password (for the verizon username) is calculated by concatenating the serial number and the model (i.e., the LVSKIHP string), running the sha256sum program, and extracting the first seven characters concatenated with the last seven characters of that SHA-256 value.\n\n- CVE-2022-34919: The file upload wizard in Zengenti Contensis Classic before 15.2.1.79 does not correctly check that a user has authenticated.

BLS signature validation in lotus uses blst library method VerifyCompressed. This method accepts signatures in 2 forms: \"serialized\", and \"compressed\", meaning that BLS signatures can be provided as either of 2 unique byte arrays. Lotus block validation functions perform a uniqueness check on provided blocks. Two blocks are considered distinct if the CIDs of their blockheader do not match. The CID method for blockheader includes the BlockSig of the block. The result of these issues is that it would be possible to punish miners for valid blocks, as there are two different valid block CIDs available for each block, even though this must be unique. By switching from the go based `blst` bindings over to the bindings in `filecoin-ffi`, the code paths now ensure that all signatures are compressed by size and the way they are deserialized. This happened in https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5393.\n\n- CVE-2020-23533: Union Pay up to 1.2.0, for web based versions contains a CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability, allows attackers to shop for free in merchants' websites and mobile apps, via a crafted authentication code (MAC) which is generated based on a secret key which is NULL.\n\n- CVE-2021-0152: Improper verification of cryptographic signature in the installer for some Intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R) and Killer(TM) Bluetooth(R) products in Windows 10 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-21238: PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. All users of pysaml2 that need to validate signed SAML documents are impacted. The vulnerability is a variant of XML Signature wrapping because it did not validate the SAML document against an XML schema. This allowed invalid XML documents to be processed and such a document can trick pysaml2 with a wrapped signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21239: PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. Users of pysaml2 that use the default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. PySAML2 does not ensure that a signed SAML document is correctly signed. The default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend is using the xmlsec1 binary to verify the signature of signed SAML documents, but by default xmlsec1 accepts any type of key found within the given document. xmlsec1 needs to be configured explicitly to only use only _x509 certificates_ for the verification process of the SAML document signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-22708: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could allow an attacker to craft a malicious firmware package and bypass the signature verification mechanism.\n\n- CVE-2021-22734: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in homeLYnk (Wiser For KNX) and spaceLYnk V2.60 and prior which could cause remote code execution when an attacker loads unauthorized code.\n\n- CVE-2021-22735: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists inhomeLYnk (Wiser For KNX) and spaceLYnk V2.60 and prior which could allow remote code execution when unauthorized code is copied to the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-28091: Lasso all versions prior to 2.7.0 has improper verification of a cryptographic signature.\n\n- CVE-2021-3033: An improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks Prisma Cloud Compute console. This vulnerability enables an attacker to bypass signature validation during SAML authentication by logging in to the Prisma Cloud Compute console as any authorized user. This issue impacts: All versions of Prisma Cloud Compute 19.11, Prisma Cloud Compute 20.04, and Prisma Cloud Compute 20.09; Prisma Cloud Compute 20.12 before update 1. Prisma Cloud Compute SaaS version is not impacted by this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-3051: An improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability exists in Cortex XSOAR SAML authentication that enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker with specific knowledge of the Cortex XSOAR instance to access protected resources and perform unauthorized actions on the Cortex XSOAR server. This issue impacts: Cortex XSOAR 5.5.0 builds earlier than 1578677; Cortex XSOAR 6.0.2 builds earlier than 1576452; Cortex XSOAR 6.1.0 builds earlier than 1578663; Cortex XSOAR 6.2.0 builds earlier than 1578666. All Cortex XSOAR instances hosted by Palo Alto Networks are protected from this vulnerability; no additional action is required for these instances.\n\n- CVE-2021-33885: An Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity vulnerability in B. Braun SpaceCom2 prior to 012U000062 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to send the device malicious data that will be used in place of the correct data. This results in full system command access and execution because of the lack of cryptographic signatures on critical data sets.\n\n- CVE-2021-37160: A firmware validation issue was discovered in HMI3 Control Panel in Swisslog Healthcare Nexus Panel operated by released versions of software before Nexus Software 7.2.5.7. There is no firmware validation (e.g., cryptographic signature validation) during a File Upload for a firmware update.\n\n- CVE-2020-36284: Union Pay up to 3.4.93.4.9, for android, contains a CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability, allows attackers to shop for free in merchants' websites and mobile apps, via a crafted authentication code (MAC) which is generated based on a secret key which is NULL.\n\n- CVE-2020-36285: Union Pay up to 3.3.12, for iOS mobile apps, contains a CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability, allows attackers to shop for free in merchants' websites and mobile apps, via a crafted authentication code (MAC) which is generated based on a secret key which is NULL.\n\n- CVE-2021-32685: tEnvoy contains the PGP, NaCl, and PBKDF2 in node.js and the browser (hashing, random, encryption, decryption, signatures, conversions), used by TogaTech.org. In versions prior to 7.0.3, the `verifyWithMessage` method of `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey` always returns `true` for any signature that has a SHA-512 hash matching the SHA-512 hash of the message even if the signature was invalid. This issue is patched in version 7.0.3. As a workaround: In `tenvoy.js` under the `verifyWithMessage` method definition within the `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey` class, ensure that the return statement call to `this.verify` ends in `.verified`.\n\n- CVE-2021-32738: js-stellar-sdk is a Javascript library for communicating with a Stellar Horizon server. The `Utils.readChallengeTx` function used in SEP-10 Stellar Web Authentication states in its function documentation that it reads and validates the challenge transaction including verifying that the `serverAccountID` has signed the transaction. In js-stellar-sdk before version 8.2.3, the function does not verify that the server has signed the transaction. Applications that also used `Utils.verifyChallengeTxThreshold` or `Utils.verifyChallengeTxSigners` to verify the signatures including the server signature on the challenge transaction are unaffected as those functions verify the server signed the transaction. Applications calling `Utils.readChallengeTx` should update to version 8.2.3, the first version with a patch for this vulnerability, to ensure that the challenge transaction is completely valid and signed by the server creating the challenge transaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-37927: Zoho ManageEngine ADManager Plus version 7110 and prior allows account takeover via SSO.\n\n- CVE-2021-29108: There is an privilege escalation vulnerability in organization-specific logins in Esri Portal for ArcGIS versions 10.9 and below that may allow a remote, authenticated attacker who is able to intercept and modify a SAML assertion to impersonate another account (XML Signature Wrapping Attack). In addition patching, Esri also strongly recommends as best practice for SAML assertions to be signed and encrypted.\n\n- CVE-2021-20156: Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 contains an improper access control configuration that could allow for a malicious firmware update. It is possible to manually install firmware that may be malicious in nature as there does not appear to be any signature validation done to determine if it is from a known and trusted source. This includes firmware updates that are done via the automated \"check for updates\" in the admin interface. If an attacker is able to masquerade as the update server, the device will not verify that the firmware updates downloaded are legitimate.\n\n- CVE-2020-1464: A spoofing vulnerability exists when Windows incorrectly validates file signatures. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass security features and load improperly signed files. In an attack scenario, an attacker could bypass security features intended to prevent improperly signed files from being loaded. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows validates file signatures. \n\n- CVE-2020-2021: When Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication is enabled and the 'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is disabled (unchecked), improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS SAML authentication enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to access protected resources. The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable server to exploit this vulnerability. This issue affects PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.3; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.9; PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.15, and all versions of PAN-OS 8.0 (EOL). This issue does not affect PAN-OS 7.1. This issue cannot be exploited if SAML is not used for authentication. This issue cannot be exploited if the 'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is enabled (checked) in the SAML Identity Provider Server Profile. Resources that can be protected by SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) authentication are: GlobalProtect Gateway, GlobalProtect Portal, GlobalProtect Clientless VPN, Authentication and Captive Portal, PAN-OS next-generation firewalls (PA-Series, VM-Series) and Panorama web interfaces, Prisma Access In the case of GlobalProtect Gateways, GlobalProtect Portal, Clientless VPN, Captive Portal, and Prisma Access, an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the affected servers can gain access to protected resources if allowed by configured authentication and Security policies. There is no impact on the integrity and availability of the gateway, portal or VPN server. An attacker cannot inspect or tamper with sessions of regular users. In the worst case, this is a critical severity vulnerability with a CVSS Base Score of 10.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N). In the case of PAN-OS and Panorama web interfaces, this issue allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the PAN-OS or Panorama web interfaces to log in as an administrator and perform administrative actions. In the worst-case scenario, this is a critical severity vulnerability with a CVSS Base Score of 10.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). If the web interfaces are only accessible to a restricted management network, then the issue is lowered to a CVSS Base Score of 9.6 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious attempts to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-32977: AVEVA System Platform versions 2017 through 2020 R2 P01 does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.\n\n- CVE-2021-35097: Possible authentication bypass due to improper order of signature verification and hashing in the signature verification call in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-35113: Possible authentication bypass due to improper order of signature verification and hashing in the signature verification call in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-36277: Dell Command | Update, Dell Update, and Alienware Update versions before 4.3 contains an Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature Vulnerability. A local authenticated malicious user may exploit this vulnerability by executing arbitrary code on the system.\n\n- CVE-2021-43074: An improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability [CWE-347] in FortiWeb 6.4 all versions, 6.3.16 and below, 6.2 all versions, 6.1 all versions, 6.0 all versions; FortiOS 7.0.3 and below, 6.4.8 and below, 6.2 all versions, 6.0 all versions; FortiSwitch 7.0.3 and below, 6.4.10 and below, 6.2 all versions, 6.0 all versions; FortiProxy 7.0.1 and below, 2.0.7 and below, 1.2 all versions, 1.1 all versions, 1.0 all versions may allow an attacker to decrypt portions of the administrative session management cookie if able to intercept the latter.\n\n- CVE-2022-1739: The tested version of Dominion Voting Systems ImageCast X does not validate application signatures to a trusted root certificate. Use of a trusted root certificate ensures software installed on a device is traceable to, or verifiable against, a cryptographic key provided by the manufacturer to detect tampering. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to install malicious code, which could also be spread to other vulnerable ImageCast X devices via removable media.\n\n- CVE-2022-20929: A vulnerability in the upgrade signature verification of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to provide an unauthentic upgrade file for upload. This vulnerability is due to insufficient cryptographic signature verification of upgrade files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing an administrator with an unauthentic upgrade file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to fully compromise the Cisco NFVIS system.\n\n- CVE-2022-23507: Tendermint is a high-performance blockchain consensus engine for Byzantine fault tolerant applications. Versions prior to 0.28.0 contain a potential attack via Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature, affecting anyone using the tendermint-light-client and related packages to perform light client verification (e.g. IBC-rs, Hermes). The light client does not check that the chain IDs of the trusted and untrusted headers match, resulting in a possible attack vector where someone who finds a header from an untrusted chain that satisfies all other verification conditions (e.g. enough overlapping validator signatures) could fool a light client. The attack vector is currently theoretical, and no proof-of-concept exists yet to exploit it on live networks. This issue is patched in version 0.28.0. There are no workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24759: `@chainsafe/libp2p-noise` contains TypeScript implementation of noise protocol, an encryption protocol used in libp2p. `@chainsafe/libp2p-noise` before 4.1.2 and 5.0.3 does not correctly validate signatures during the handshake process. This may allow a man-in-the-middle to pose as other peers and get those peers banned. Users should upgrade to version 4.1.2 or 5.0.3 to receive a patch. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-25898: The package jsrsasign before 10.5.25 are vulnerable to Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature when JWS or JWT signature with non Base64URL encoding special characters or number escaped characters may be validated as valid by mistake. Workaround: Validate JWS or JWT signature if it has Base64URL and dot safe string before executing JWS.verify() or JWS.verifyJWT() method.\n\n- CVE-2022-2790: Emerson Electric's Proficy Machine Edition Version 9.00 and prior is vulenrable to CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature, and does not properly verify compiled logic (PDT files) and data blocks data (BLD/BLK files).\n\n- CVE-2022-31156: Gradle is a build tool. Dependency verification is a security feature in Gradle Build Tool that was introduced to allow validation of external dependencies either through their checksum or cryptographic signatures. In versions 6.2 through 7.4.2, there are some cases in which Gradle may skip that verification and accept a dependency that would otherwise fail the build as an untrusted external artifact. This can occur in two ways. When signature verification is disabled but the verification metadata contains entries for dependencies that only have a `gpg` element but no `checksum` element. When signature verification is enabled, the verification metadata contains entries for dependencies with a `gpg` element but there is no signature file on the remote repository. In both cases, the verification will accept the dependency, skipping signature verification and not complaining that the dependency has no checksum entry. For builds that are vulnerable, there are two risks. Gradle could download a malicious binary from a repository outside your organization due to name squatting. For those still using HTTP only and not HTTPS for downloading dependencies, the build could download a malicious library instead of the expected one. Gradle 7.5 patches this issue by making sure to run checksum verification if signature verification cannot be completed, whatever the reason. Two workarounds are available: Remove all `gpg` elements from dependency verification metadata if you disable signature validation and/or avoid adding `gpg` entries for dependencies that do not have signature files.\n\n- CVE-2022-31206: The Omron SYSMAC Nx product family PLCs (NJ series, NY series, NX series, and PMAC series) through 2022-005-18 lack cryptographic authentication. These PLCs are programmed using the SYMAC Studio engineering software (which compiles IEC 61131-3 conformant POU code to native machine code for execution by the PLC's runtime). The resulting machine code is executed by a runtime, typically controlled by a real-time operating system. The logic that is downloaded to the PLC does not seem to be cryptographically authenticated, allowing an attacker to manipulate transmitted object code to the PLC and execute arbitrary machine code on the processor of the PLC's CPU module in the context of the runtime. In the case of at least the NJ series, an RTOS and hardware combination is used that would potentially allow for memory protection and privilege separation and thus limit the impact of code execution. However, it was not confirmed whether these sufficiently segment the runtime from the rest of the RTOS.\n\n- CVE-2022-31207: The Omron SYSMAC Cx product family PLCs (CS series, CJ series, and CP series) through 2022-05-18 lack cryptographic authentication. They utilize the Omron FINS (9600/TCP) protocol for engineering purposes, including downloading projects and control logic to the PLC. This protocol has authentication flaws as reported in FSCT-2022-0057. Control logic is downloaded to PLC volatile memory using the FINS Program Area Read and Program Area Write commands or to non-volatile memory using other commands from where it can be loaded into volatile memory for execution. The logic that is loaded into and executed from the user program area exists in compiled object code form. Upon execution, these object codes are first passed to a dedicated ASIC that determines whether the object code is to be executed by the ASIC or the microprocessor. In the former case, the object code is interpreted by the ASIC whereas in the latter case the object code is passed to the microprocessor for object code interpretation by a ROM interpreter. In the abnormal case where the object code cannot be handled by either, an abnormal condition is triggered and the PLC is halted. The logic that is downloaded to the PLC does not seem to be cryptographically authenticated, thus allowing an attacker to manipulate transmitted object code to the PLC and either execute arbitrary object code commands on the ASIC or on the microprocessor interpreter.\n\n- CVE-2022-34459:  Dell Command | Update, Dell Update, and Alienware Update versions prior to 4.7 contain a improper verification of cryptographic signature in get applicable driver component. A local malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to malicious payload execution. \n\n- CVE-2022-39366: DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. Prior to version 0.8.45, the `StatelessTokenService` of the DataHub metadata service (GMS) does not verify the signature of JWT tokens. This allows an attacker to connect to DataHub instances as any user if Metadata Service authentication is enabled. This vulnerability occurs because the `StatelessTokenService` of the Metadata service uses the `parse` method of `io.jsonwebtoken.JwtParser`, which does not perform a verification of the cryptographic token signature. This means that JWTs are accepted regardless of the used algorithm. This issue may lead to an authentication bypass. Version 0.8.45 contains a patch for the issue. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-41666: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists that allows adversaries with local user privileges to load a malicious DLL which could lead to execution of malicious code. Affected Products: EcoStruxure Operator Terminal Expert(V3.3 Hotfix 1 or prior), Pro-face BLUE(V3.3 Hotfix1 or prior).\n\n- CVE-2022-41669: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in the SGIUtility component that allows adversaries with local user privileges to load a malicious DLL which could result in execution of malicious code. Affected Products: EcoStruxure Operator Terminal Expert(V3.3 Hotfix 1 or prior), Pro-face BLUE(V3.3 Hotfix1 or prior).\n\n- CVE-2021-23993: An attacker may perform a DoS attack to prevent a user from sending encrypted email to a correspondent. If an attacker creates a crafted OpenPGP key with a subkey that has an invalid self signature, and the Thunderbird user imports the crafted key, then Thunderbird may try to use the invalid subkey, but the RNP library rejects it from being used, causing encryption to fail. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.9.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23540: In versions `<=8.5.1` of `jsonwebtoken` library, lack of algorithm definition in the `jwt.verify()` function can lead to signature validation bypass due to defaulting to the `none` algorithm for signature verification. Users are affected if you do not specify algorithms in the `jwt.verify()` function. This issue has been fixed, please update to version 9.0.0 which removes the default support for the none algorithm in the `jwt.verify()` method. There will be no impact, if you update to version 9.0.0 and you don\u2019t need to allow for the `none` algorithm. If you need 'none' algorithm, you have to explicitly specify that in `jwt.verify()` options. \n\n- CVE-2022-42793: An issue in code signature validation was addressed with improved checks. This issue is fixed in macOS Big Sur 11.7, macOS Ventura 13, iOS 16, iOS 15.7 and iPadOS 15.7, macOS Monterey 12.6. An app may be able to bypass code signing checks.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-345 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-345 (ChildOf)",

An invalid value prevents initialization of variables, which can be modified by attacker and later injected into PHP eval statement.\n\n- CVE-2007-2713: Chain: Execution after redirect triggers eval injection.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-21305: CarrierWave is an open-source RubyGem which provides a simple and flexible way to upload files from Ruby applications. In CarrierWave before versions 1.3.2 and 2.1.1, there is a code injection vulnerability. The \"#manipulate!\" method inappropriately evals the content of mutation option(:read/:write), allowing attackers to craft a string that can be executed as a Ruby code. If an application developer supplies untrusted inputs to the option, it will lead to remote code execution(RCE). This is fixed in versions 1.3.2 and 2.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-27928: A remote code execution issue was discovered in MariaDB 10.2 before 10.2.37, 10.3 before 10.3.28, 10.4 before 10.4.18, and 10.5 before 10.5.9; Percona Server through 2021-03-03; and the wsrep patch through 2021-03-03 for MySQL. An untrusted search path leads to eval injection, in which a database SUPER user can execute OS commands after modifying wsrep_provider and wsrep_notify_cmd. NOTE: this does not affect an Oracle product.\n\n- CVE-2021-3725: Vulnerability in dirhistory plugin Description: the widgets that go back and forward in the directory history, triggered by pressing Alt-Left and Alt-Right, use functions that unsafely execute eval on directory names. If you cd into a directory with a carefully-crafted name, then press Alt-Left, the system is subject to command injection. Impacted areas: - Functions pop_past and pop_future in dirhistory plugin.\n\n- CVE-2021-21278: RSSHub is an open source, easy to use, and extensible RSS feed generator. In RSSHub before version 7f1c430 (non-semantic versioning) there is a risk of code injection. Some routes use `eval` or `Function constructor`, which may be injected by the target site with unsafe code, causing server-side security issues The fix in version 7f1c430 is to temporarily remove the problematic route and added a `no-new-func` rule to eslint.\n\n- CVE-2021-40084: opensysusers through 0.6 does not safely use eval on files in sysusers.d that may contain shell metacharacters. For example, it allows command execution via a crafted GECOS field whereas systemd-sysusers (a program with the same specification) does not do that.\n\n- CVE-2021-42057: Obsidian Dataview through 0.4.12-hotfix1 allows eval injection. The evalInContext function in executes user input, which allows an attacker to craft malicious Markdown files that will execute arbitrary code once opened. NOTE: 0.4.13 provides a mitigation for some use cases.\n\n- CVE-2021-32756: ManageIQ is an open-source management platform. In versions prior to jansa-4, kasparov-2, and lasker-1, there is a flaw in the MiqExpression module of ManageIQ where a low privilege user could enter a crafted Ruby string which would be evaluated. Successful exploitation will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the host system. There are patches for this issue in releases named jansa-4, kasparov-2, and lasker-1. If possible, restrict users, via RBAC, to only the part of the application that they need access to. While MiqExpression is widely used throughout the product, restricting users can limit the surface of the attack.\n\n- CVE-2020-22201: phpCMS 2008 sp4 allowas remote malicious users to execute arbitrary php commands via the pagesize parameter to yp/product.php.\n\n- CVE-2021-23344: The package total.js before 3.4.8 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via set.\n\n- CVE-2021-32924: Invision Community (aka IPS Community Suite) before 4.6.0 allows eval-based PHP code injection by a moderator because the IPS\\\\cms\\\\modules\\\\front\\\\pages\\\\_builder::previewBlock method interacts unsafely with the IPS\\\\_Theme::runProcessFunction method.\n\n- CVE-2021-41228: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions TensorFlow's `saved_model_cli` tool is vulnerable to a code injection as it calls `eval` on user supplied strings. This can be used by attackers to run arbitrary code on the plaform where the CLI tool runs. However, given that the tool is always run manually, the impact of this is not severe. We have patched this by adding a `safe` flag which defaults to `True` and an explicit warning for users. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-43281: MyBB before 1.8.29 allows Remote Code Injection by an admin with the \"Can manage settings?\" permission. The Admin CP's Settings management module does not validate setting types correctly on insertion and update, making it possible to add settings of supported type \"php\" with PHP code, executed on Change Settings pages.\n\n- CVE-2020-15591: fexsrv in F*EX (aka Frams' Fast File EXchange) before fex-20160919_2 allows eval injection (for unauthenticated remote code execution).\n\n- CVE-2021-43269: In Code42 app before 8.8.0, eval injection allows an attacker to change a device\u2019s proxy configuration to use a malicious proxy auto-config (PAC) file, leading to arbitrary code execution. This affects Incydr Basic, Advanced, and Gov F1; CrashPlan Cloud; and CrashPlan for Small Business. (Incydr Professional and Enterprise are unaffected.)\n\n- CVE-2021-23277: Eaton Intelligent Power Manager (IPM) prior to 1.69 is vulnerable to unauthenticated eval injection vulnerability. The software does not neutralize code syntax from users before using in the dynamic evaluation call in loadUserFile function under scripts/libs/utils.js. Successful exploitation can allow attackers to control the input to the function and execute attacker controlled commands.\n\n- CVE-2022-40871: Dolibarr ERP & CRM <=15.0.3 is vulnerable to Eval injection. By default, any administrator can be added to the installation page of dolibarr, and if successfully added, malicious code can be inserted into the database and then execute it by eval.\n\n- CVE-2021-22204: Improper neutralization of user data in the DjVu file format in ExifTool versions 7.44 and up allows arbitrary code execution when parsing the malicious image\n\n- CVE-2022-0845: Code Injection in GitHub repository pytorchlightning/pytorch-lightning prior to 1.6.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-29216: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, TensorFlow's `saved_model_cli` tool is vulnerable to a code injection. This can be used to open a reverse shell. This code path was maintained for compatibility reasons as the maintainers had several test cases where numpy expressions were used as arguments. However, given that the tool is always run manually, the impact of this is still not severe. The maintainers have now removed the `safe=False` argument, so all parsing is done without calling `eval`. The patch is available in versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4.\n\n- CVE-2022-32417: PbootCMS v3.1.2 was discovered to contain a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability via the function parserIfLabel at function.php.\n\n- CVE-2022-3394: The WP All Export Pro WordPress plugin before 1.7.9 does not limit some functionality during exports only to users with the Administrator role, allowing any logged in user which has been given privileges to perform exports to execute arbitrary code on the site. By default only administrators can run exports, but the privilege can be delegated to lower privileged users.\n\n- CVE-2022-38193: There is a code injection vulnerability in Esri Portal for ArcGIS versions 10.8.1 and below that may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to pass strings which could potentially cause arbitrary code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-46648: ruby-git versions prior to v1.13.0 allows a remote authenticated attacker to execute an arbitrary ruby code by having a user to load a repository containing a specially crafted filename to the product. This vulnerability is different from CVE-2022-47318.\n\n- CVE-2021-40553: piwigo 11.5.0 is affected by a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the LocalFiles Editor.\n\n- CVE-2022-2054: Code Injection in GitHub repository nuitka/nuitka prior to 0.9. \n\n- CVE-2022-45907: In PyTorch before trunk/89695, torch.jit.annotations.parse_type_line can cause arbitrary code execution because eval is used unsafely.\n\n- CVE-2022-46333: The admin user interface in Proofpoint Enterprise Protection (PPS/PoD) contains a command injection vulnerability that enables an admin to execute commands beyond their allowed scope. This affects all versions 8.19.0 and below. \n\n- CVE-2022-48175: Rukovoditel v3.2.1 was discovered to contain a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the component /rukovoditel/index.php?module=dashboard/ajax_request.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-94 (ChildOf)",

When configured to use a specific server for a given network interface, dnsmasq uses a fixed port while forwarding queries. An attacker on the network, able to find the outgoing port used by dnsmasq, only needs to guess the random transmission ID to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This flaw makes a DNS Cache Poisoning attack much easier. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-23020: The NAAS 3.x before 3.10.0 API keys were generated using an insecure pseudo-random string and hashing algorithm which could lead to predictable keys.\n\n- CVE-2021-41829: Zoho ManageEngine Remote Access Plus before 10.1.2121.1 relies on the application's build number to calculate a certain encryption key.\n\n- CVE-2021-31520: A weak session token authentication bypass vulnerability in Trend Micro IM Security 1.6 and 1.6.5 could allow an remote attacker to guess currently logged-in administrators' session session token in order to gain access to the product's web management interface.\n\n- CVE-2021-0466: In startIpClient of ClientModeImpl.java, there is a possible identifier which could be used to track a device.

Single machine Dask clusters started with dask.distributed.LocalCluster or dask.distributed.Client (which defaults to using LocalCluster) would mistakenly configure their respective Dask workers to listen on external interfaces (typically with a randomly selected high port) rather than only on localhost. A Dask cluster created using this method (when running on a machine that has an applicable port exposed) could be used by a sophisticated attacker to achieve remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2021-22916: In Brave Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.26.60, when adblocking is enabled and a proxy browser extension is installed, the CNAME adblocking feature issues DNS requests that used the system DNS settings instead of the extension's proxy settings, resulting in possible information disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2021-22917: Brave Browser Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.20 is vulnerable to information disclosure by way of DNS requests in Tor windows not flowing through Tor if adblocking was enabled.\n\n- CVE-2020-4062: In Conjur OSS Helm Chart before 2.0.0, a recently identified critical vulnerability resulted in the installation of the Conjur Postgres database with an open port. This allows an attacker to gain full read & write access to the Conjur Postgres database, including escalating the attacker's privileges to assume full control. A malicious actor who knows the IP address and port number of the Postgres database and has access into the Kubernetes cluster where Conjur runs can gain full read & write access to the Postgres database. This enables the attacker to write a policy that allows full access to retrieve any secret. This Helm chart is a method to install Conjur OSS into a Kubernetes environment. Hence, the systems impacted are only Conjur OSS systems that were deployed using this chart. Other deployments including Docker and the CyberArk Dynamic Access Provider (DAP) are not affected. To remediate this vulnerability, clone the latest Helm Chart and follow the upgrade instructions. If you are not able to fully remediate this vulnerability immediately, you can mitigate some of the risk by making sure Conjur OSS is deployed on an isolated Kubernetes cluster or namespace. The term \"isolated\" refers to: - No other workloads besides Conjur OSS and its backend database are running in that Kubernetes cluster/namespace. - Kubernetes and helm access to the cluster/namespace is limited to security administrators via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).\n\n- CVE-2020-10087: GitLab before 12.8.2 allows Information Disclosure. Badge images were not being proxied, causing mixed content warnings as well as leaking the IP address of the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-32690: Helm is a tool for managing Charts (packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources). In versions of helm prior to 3.6.1, a vulnerability exists where the username and password credentials associated with a Helm repository could be passed on to another domain referenced by that Helm repository. This issue has been resolved in 3.6.1. There is a workaround through which one may check for improperly passed credentials. One may use a username and password for a Helm repository and may audit the Helm repository in order to check for another domain being used that could have received the credentials. In the `index.yaml` file for that repository, one may look for another domain in the `urls` list for the chart versions. If there is another domain found and that chart version was pulled or installed, the credentials would be passed on.\n\n- CVE-2021-32707: Nextcloud Mail is a mail app for Nextcloud. In versions prior to 1.9.6, the Nextcloud Mail application does not, by default, render images in emails to not leak the read state. The privacy filter failed to filter images with a `background-image` CSS attribute. Note that the images were still passed through the Nextcloud image proxy, and thus there was no IP leakage. The issue was patched in version 1.9.6 and 1.10.0. No workarounds are known to exist.\n\n- CVE-2020-14312: A flaw was found in the default configuration of dnsmasq, as shipped with Fedora versions prior to 31 and in all versions Red Hat Enterprise Linux, where it listens on any interface and accepts queries from addresses outside of its local subnet. In particular, the option `local-service` is not enabled. Running dnsmasq in this manner may inadvertently make it an open resolver accessible from any address on the internet. This flaw allows an attacker to conduct a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against other systems.\n\n- CVE-2021-20149: Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 does not have sufficient access controls for the WAN interface. The default iptables ruleset for governing access to services on the device only apply to IPv4. All services running on the devices are accessible via the WAN interface via IPv6 by default.\n\n- CVE-2020-1938: When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations.\n\n- CVE-2022-22547: Simple Diagnostics Agent - versions 1.0 (up to version 1.57.), allows an attacker to access information which would otherwise be restricted via a random port 9000-65535. This allows information gathering which could be used exploit future open-source security exploits.\n\n- CVE-2022-44784: An issue was discovered in Appalti & Contratti 9.12.2. The target web applications LFS and DL229 expose a set of services provided by the Axis 1.4 instance, embedded directly into the applications, as hinted by the WEB-INF/web.xml file leaked through Local File Inclusion. Among the exposed services, there is the Axis AdminService, which, through the default configuration, should normally be accessible only by the localhost. Nevertheless, by trying to access the mentioned service, both in LFS and DL229, the service can actually be reached even by remote users, allowing creation of arbitrary services on the server side. When an attacker can reach the AdminService, they can use it to instantiate arbitrary services on the server. The exploit procedure is well known and described in Generic AXIS-SSRF exploitation. Basically, the attack consists of writing a JSP page inside the root directory of the web application, through the org.apache.axis.handlers.LogHandler class.\n\n- CVE-2022-26834: Improper access control vulnerability in Rakuten Casa version AP_F_V1_4_1 or AP_F_V2_0_0 allows a remote attacker to obtain the information stored in the product because the product is set to accept HTTP connections from the WAN side by default.\n\n- CVE-2022-4390: A network misconfiguration is present in versions prior to 1.0.9.90 of the NETGEAR RAX30 AX2400 series of routers. IPv6 is enabled for the WAN interface by default on these devices. While there are firewall restrictions in place that define access restrictions for IPv4 traffic, these restrictions do not appear to be applied to the WAN interface for IPv6. This allows arbitrary access to any services running on the device that may be inadvertently listening via IPv6, such as the SSH and Telnet servers spawned on ports 22 and 23 by default. This misconfiguration could allow an attacker to interact with services only intended to be accessible by clients on the local network.\n\n- CVE-2022-45414: If a Thunderbird user quoted from an HTML email, for example by replying to the email, and the email contained either a VIDEO tag with the POSTER attribute or an OBJECT tag with a DATA attribute, a network request to the referenced remote URL was performed, regardless of a configuration to block remote content. An image loaded from the POSTER attribute was shown in the composer window. These issues could have given an attacker additional capabilities when targetting releases that did not yet have a fix for CVE-2022-3033 which was reported around three months ago. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.5.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-47717: Last Yard 22.09.8-1 is vulnerable to Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).\n\n- CVE-2022-3057: Inappropriate implementation in iframe Sandbox in Google Chrome prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-31055: kCTF is a Kubernetes-based infrastructure for capture the flag (CTF) competitions. Prior to version 1.6.0, the kctf cluster set-src-ip-ranges was broken and allowed traffic from any IP. The problem has been patched in v1.6.0. As a workaround, those who want to test challenges privately can mark them as `public: false` and use `kctf chal debug port-forward` to connect.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",

NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-11736.\n\n- CVE-2021-21272: ORAS is open source software which enables a way to push OCI Artifacts to OCI Conformant registries. ORAS is both a CLI for initial testing and a Go Module. In ORAS from version 0.4.0 and before version 0.9.0, there is a \"zip-slip\" vulnerability. The directory support feature allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links and hard links. A well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who runs `oras pull`. Users of the affected versions are impacted if they are `oras` CLI users who runs `oras pull`, or if they are Go programs, which invoke `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`. The problem has been fixed in version 0.9.0. For `oras` CLI users, there is no workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider. For `oras` package users, the workaround is to not use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`, and use other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider.\n\n- CVE-2021-28650: autoar-extractor.c in GNOME gnome-autoar before 0.3.1, as used by GNOME Shell, Nautilus, and other software, allows Directory Traversal during extraction because it lacks a check of whether a file's parent is a symlink in certain complex situations. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-36241.\n\n- CVE-2021-32518: A vulnerability in share_link in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote attackers to create a symbolic link then access arbitrary files. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32803: The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.4.15, and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via insufficient symlink protection. `node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-32825: bblfshd is an open source self-hosted server for source code parsing. In bblfshd before commit 4265465b9b6fb5663c30ee43806126012066aad4 there is a \"zipslip\" vulnerability. The unsafe handling of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may enable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations outside the designated target folder. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive file. Additionally, if the attacker has read access to the unpacked files, he may be able to read arbitrary system files the parent process has permissions to read. For more details including a PoC see the referenced GHSL-2020-258.\n\n- CVE-2021-36286: Dell SupportAssist Client Consumer versions 3.9.13.0 and any versions prior to 3.9.13.0 contain an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability that can be exploited by using the Windows feature of NTFS called Symbolic links. Symbolic links can be created by any(non-privileged) user under some object directories, but by themselves are not sufficient to successfully escalate privileges. However, combining them with a different object, such as the NTFS junction point allows for the exploitation. Support assist clean files functionality do not distinguish junction points from the physical folder and proceeds to clean the target of the junction that allows nonprivileged users to create junction points and delete arbitrary files on the system which can be accessed only by the admin.\n\n- CVE-2021-38511: An issue was discovered in the tar crate before 0.4.36 for Rust. When symlinks are present in a TAR archive, extraction can create arbitrary directories via .. traversal.\n\n- CVE-2021-29136: Open Container Initiative umoci before 0.4.7 allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary host paths via a crafted image that causes symlink traversal when \"umoci unpack\" or \"umoci raw unpack\" is used.\n\n- CVE-2020-27833: A Zip Slip vulnerability was found in the oc binary in openshift-clients where an arbitrary file write is achieved by using a specially crafted raw container image (.tar file) which contains symbolic links. The vulnerability is limited to the command `oc image extract`. If a symbolic link is first created pointing within the tarball, this allows further symbolic links to bypass the existing path check. This flaw allows the tarball to create links outside the tarball's parent directory, allowing for executables or configuration files to be overwritten, resulting in arbitrary code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. Versions up to and including openshift-clients-4.7.0-202104250659.p0.git.95881af are affected.\n\n- CVE-2020-27697: Trend Micro Security 2020 (Consumer) contains a vulnerability in the installer package that could be exploited by placing a malicious DLL in a non-protected location with high privileges (symlink attack) which can lead to obtaining administrative privileges during the installation of the product.\n\n- CVE-2020-4717: A vulnerability exists in IBM SPSS Modeler Subscription Installer that allows a user with create symbolic link permission to write arbitrary file in another protected path during product installation.

It affects multi-user setups in which \u2019guix-daemon\u2019 runs locally. The attack consists in having an unprivileged user spawn a build process, for instance with `guix build`, that makes its build directory world-writable. The user then creates a hardlink to a root-owned file such as /etc/shadow in that build directory. If the user passed the --keep-failed option and the build eventually fails, the daemon changes ownership of the whole build tree, including the hardlink, to the user. At that point, the user has write access to the target file. Versions after and including v0.11.0-3298-g2608e40988, and versions prior to v1.2.0-75109-g94f0312546 are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2020-28007: Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Execution with Unnecessary Privileges.

            "matched_text": "CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions\n\nType: Base\n\nStatus: Incomplete\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product creates a temporary file in a directory whose permissions allow unintended actors to determine the file's existence or otherwise access that file.\n\nExtended Details:\n\nOn some operating systems, the fact that the temporary file exists may be apparent to any user with sufficient privileges to access that directory. Since the file is visible, the application that is using the temporary file could be known. If one has access to list the processes on the system, the attacker has gained information about what the user is doing at that time. By correlating this with the applications the user is running, an attacker could potentially discover what a user's actions are. From this, higher levels of security could be breached.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-27818: A hotkey daemon written in Rust creates a domain socket file underneath /tmp, which is accessible by any user.\n\n- CVE-2021-21290: A Java-based application for a rapid-development framework uses File.createTempFile() to create a random temporary file with insecure default permissions.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-28568: Adobe Genuine Services version 7.1 (and earlier) is affected by an Insecure file permission vulnerability during installation process. A local authenticated attacker could leverage this vulnerability to achieve privilege escalation in the context of the current user.\n\n- CVE-2021-42254: BeyondTrust Privilege Management prior to version 21.6 creates a Temporary File in a Directory with Insecure Permissions.\n\n- CVE-2021-28597: Adobe Photoshop Elements version 5.2 (and earlier) is affected by an insecure temporary file creation vulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker could leverage this vulnerability to call functions against the installer to perform high privileged actions. Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-28623: Adobe Premiere Elements version 5.2 (and earlier) is affected by an insecure temporary file creation vulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker could leverage this vulnerability to call functions against the installer to perform high privileged actions. Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-28168: Eclipse Jersey 2.28 to 2.33 and Eclipse Jersey 3.0.0 to 3.0.1 contains a local information disclosure vulnerability. This is due to the use of the File.createTempFile which creates a file inside of the system temporary directory with the permissions: -rw-r--r--. Thus the contents of this file are viewable by all other users locally on the system. As such, if the contents written is security sensitive, it can be disclosed to other local users.\n\n- CVE-2021-36002: Adobe Captivate version 11.5.5 (and earlier) is affected by an Creation of Temporary File In Directory With Incorrect Permissions vulnerability that could result in privilege escalation in the context of the current user. The attacker must plant a malicious file in a particular location of the victim's machine. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must launch the Captivate Installer.\n\n- CVE-2021-42255: AppGuard Enterprise before 6.7.100.1 creates a Temporary File in a Directory with Insecure Permissions. Local users can gain SYSTEM privileges because a repair operation relies on the %TEMP% directory of an unprivileged user.\n\n- CVE-2021-42712: Splashtop Streamer through 3.4.8.3 creates a Temporary File in a Directory with Insecure Permissions.\n\n- CVE-2021-44049: CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager (EPM) through 11.5.3.328 before 2021-12-20 allows a local user to gain elevated privileges via a Trojan horse Procmon64.exe in the user's Temp directory.\n\n- CVE-2021-41988: Qlik NPrinting Designer through 21.14.3.0 creates a Temporary File in a Directory with Insecure Permissions.\n\n- CVE-2021-41989: Qlik QlikView through 12.60.20100.0 creates a Temporary File in a Directory with Insecure Permissions.\n\n- CVE-2021-42713: Splashtop Remote Client (Personal Edition) through 3.4.6.1 creates a Temporary File in a Directory with Insecure Permissions.\n\n- CVE-2021-42714: Splashtop Remote Client (Business Edition) through 3.4.8.3 creates a Temporary File in a Directory with Insecure Permissions.\n\n- CVE-2022-21126: The package com.github.samtools:htsjdk before 3.0.1 are vulnerable to Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions due to the createTempDir() function in util/IOUtil.java not checking for the existence of the temporary directory before attempting to create it.\n\n- CVE-2022-3952: A vulnerability has been found in ManyDesigns Portofino 5.3.2 and classified as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is the function createTempDir of the file WarFileLauncher.java. The manipulation leads to creation of temporary file in directory with insecure permissions. Upgrading to version 5.3.3 is able to address this issue. The name of the patch is 94653cb357806c9cf24d8d294e6afea33f8f0775. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The identifier VDB-213457 was assigned to this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-28633: Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop Application (installer) version 2.4 (and earlier) is affected by an Insecure temporary file creation vulnerability. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to cause arbitrary file overwriting in the context of the current user. Exploitation of this issue requires physical interaction to the system.\n\n- CVE-2021-21428: Openapi generator is a java tool which allows generation of API client libraries (SDK generation), server stubs, documentation and configuration automatically given an OpenAPI Spec. openapi-generator-online creates insecure temporary folders with File.createTempFile during the code generation process. The insecure temporary folders store the auto-generated files which can be read and appended to by any users on the system. The issue has been patched with `Files.createTempFile` and released in the v5.1.0 stable version.\n\n- CVE-2022-27818: SWHKD 1.1.5 unsafely uses the /tmp/swhkd.sock pathname. There can be an information leak or denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2022-23950: In Keylime before 6.3.0, Revocation Notifier uses a fixed /tmp path for UNIX domain socket which can allow unprivileged users a method to prohibit keylime operations.\n\n- CVE-2022-23163: Dell PowerScale OneFS, 8.2,x, 9.1.0.x, 9.2.1.x, and 9.3.0.x contain a denial of service vulnerability. A local malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to denial of service/data unavailability.\n\n- CVE-2022-26850: When creating or updating credentials for single-user access, Apache NiFi wrote a copy of the Login Identity Providers configuration to the operating system temporary directory. On most platforms, the operating system temporary directory has global read permissions. NiFi immediately moved the temporary file to the final configuration directory, which significantly limited the window of opportunity for access. NiFi 1.16.0 includes updates to replace the Login Identity Providers configuration without writing a file to the operating system temporary directory.\n\n- CVE-2022-28226: Local privilege vulnerability in Yandex Browser for Windows prior to 22.3.3.801 allows a local, low privileged, attacker to execute arbitary code with the SYSTEM privileges through manipulating temporary files in directory with insecure permissions during Yandex Browser update process.\n\n- CVE-2022-41946: pgjdbc is an open source postgresql JDBC Driver. In affected versions a prepared statement using either `PreparedStatement.setText(int, InputStream)` or `PreparedStatemet.setBytea(int, InputStream)` will create a temporary file if the InputStream is larger than 2k. This will create a temporary file which is readable by other users on Unix like systems, but not MacOS. On Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. Because of this, when files and directories are written into this directory they are, by default, readable by other users on that same system. This vulnerability does not allow other users to overwrite the contents of these directories or files. This is purely an information disclosure vulnerability. Because certain JDK file system APIs were only added in JDK 1.7, this this fix is dependent upon the version of the JDK you are using. Java 1.7 and higher users: this vulnerability is fixed in 4.5.0. Java 1.6 and lower users: no patch is available. If you are unable to patch, or are stuck running on Java 1.6, specifying the java.io.tmpdir system environment variable to a directory that is exclusively owned by the executing user will mitigate this vulnerability.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-377 (ChildOf)",

    "enhanced_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nCryptRandom Perl package 1.05 through 1.55 may use rand() function, which is not cryptographically strong, for cryptographic functions. If the Provider is not specified and /dev/urandom or an Entropy Gathering Daemon (egd) service is not available CryptRandom will default to use the **insecure CryptRandomrand provider**. In particular, Windows versions of perl will encounter this issue by default.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **use of rand() function**\n- **weakness:** **insecure CryptRandomrand provider**\n- **product:** CryptRandom Perl package\n- **version:** 1.05 through 1.55\n- **component:** cryptographic functions\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\n## Analysis of CVE-2025-1828 related content:\n\nBased on the provided content, here's an extraction of relevant information, focusing on the commit messages and documentation related to `Crypt::Random`:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe `rand` provider in `Crypt::Random` was identified as insecure for cryptographic purposes. It relied on Perl's internal `rand` function, which is not a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG).\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Use of a non-cryptographically secure random number generator (`rand`) as a default or available option.\n*   Potential for predictable or biased random numbers when using the `rand` provider.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nUsing the insecure `rand` provider could compromise the security of applications relying on `Crypt::Random` for generating random numbers, especially in cryptographic contexts. This could lead to vulnerabilities such as:\n\n*   Predictable keys or initialization vectors.\n*   Weakened encryption.\n*   Successful attacks against systems relying on randomness for security.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nAn attacker could exploit the vulnerability by:\n\n*   Forcing the application to use the `rand` provider.\n*   Predicting the output of the `rand` function and using this information to compromise the system.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\nThe attacker would need to be able to influence the application to use the insecure `rand` provider. This could involve:\n\n*   Controlling the application's configuration.\n*   Exploiting a vulnerability that allows them to specify the random number generator.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe following steps were taken to mitigate the vulnerability:\n\n1.  **Switch to `Crypt::URandom`:** The `rand` provider was updated to use `Crypt::URandom::urandom` instead of Perl's internal `rand` function. This provides a more secure random number generation mechanism.\n2.  **Move `rand` and `egd` to low strength list:** The `rand` and `egd` providers were moved to the low strength provider list.\n3.  **Default to strong randomness:** The code now defaults to using strong randomness (using `/dev/urandom` or `Crypt::URandom::urandom`) if the `Strength` parameter is not explicitly specified.\n4.  **Added Win32API Provider:** A new Win32API Provider was added for Windows.\n5.  **Documentation update:** The documentation for `rand` explicitly states that it is *not* cryptographically secure and recommends using other modules for security-sensitive applications.\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n*   The commit messages indicate a broader effort to modernize the `Crypt::Random` module, including moving to `Dist::Zilla` for building, adding GitHub Actions for testing, and updating copyright information.\n*   The perldoc.perl.org documentation for `rand` also explicitly warns against using it in security-sensitive situations and lists alternative modules for cryptographically secure random number generation.\n\n**Note:** This analysis is based solely on the provided content. The official CVE description may contain additional details or context.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 338 | Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.374 |\n| 2 | 335 | Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.342 |\n| 3 | 1204 | Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV) | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.330 |\n| 4 | 327 | Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.328 |\n| 5 | 1391 | Use of Weak Credentials | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.327 |\n| 6 | 1241 | Use of Predictable Algorithm in Random Number Generator | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.585 |\n| 7 | 208 | Observable Timing Discrepancy | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 347 | Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.317 |\n| 9 | 95 | Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection') | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.316 |\n| 10 | 330 | Use of Insufficiently Random Values | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.309 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) in a security context, but the PRNG's algorithm is not cryptographically strong.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen a non-cryptographic PRNG is used in a cryptographic context, it can expose the cryptography to certain types of attacks.\n\n\nOften a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is not designed for cryptography. Sometimes a mediocre source of randomness is sufficient or preferable for algorithms that use random numbers. Weak generators generally take less processing power and/or do not use the precious, finite, entropy sources on a system. While such PRNGs might have very useful features, these same features could be used to break the cryptography.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-330\nChildOf -> CWE-330\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Within the developer and other communities, \"randomness\" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, \"entropy\" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-3692:** PHP framework uses mt_rand() function (Marsenne Twister) when generating tokens\n- **CVE-2009-3278:** Crypto product uses rand() library function to generate a recovery key, making it easier to conduct brute force attacks.\n- **CVE-2009-3238:** Random number generator can repeatedly generate the same value.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-335: Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) but does not correctly manage seeds.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\n PRNGs are deterministic and, while their output appears random, they cannot actually create entropy. They rely on cryptographically secure and unique seeds for entropy so proper seeding is critical to the secure operation of the PRNG.\n\n\n Management of seeds could be broken down into two main areas: \n\n\n  -  (1) protecting seeds as cryptographic material (such as a cryptographic key); \n\n  -  (2) whenever possible, using a uniquely generated seed from a cryptographically secure source \n\n PRNGs require a seed as input to generate a stream of numbers that are functionally indistinguishable from random numbers. While the output is, in many cases, sufficient for cryptographic uses, the output of any PRNG is directly determined by the seed provided as input. If the seed can be ascertained by a third party, the entire output of the PRNG can be made known to them. As such, the seed should be kept secret and should ideally not be able to be guessed. For example, the current time may be a poor seed. Knowing the approximate time the PRNG was seeded greatly reduces the possible key space. \n\n Seeds do not necessarily need to be unique, but reusing seeds may open up attacks if the seed is discovered. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-330\nChildOf -> CWE-330\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Primitives may vary in how important these properties are. If these properties are not maintained, e.g. by a bug in the code, then the cryptography may be weakened or broken by attacking the IVs themselves.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-330\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

In CBC mode, chained initialization vectors are non-random, allowing decryption of HTTPS traffic using a chosen plaintext attack.\n- **CVE-2001-0161:** wireless router does not use 6 of the 24 bits for WEP encryption, making it easier for attackers to decrypt traffic\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nCryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.\n\n\nIt is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.\n\n\nSince the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered \"unsafe\" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.\n\n\nFor a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-693\nPeerOf -> CWE-311\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30273:** SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity\n- **CVE-2022-30320:** Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.\n- **CVE-2008-3775:** Product uses \"ROT-25\" to obfuscate the password in the registry.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nBy design, authentication protocols try to ensure that attackers must perform brute force attacks if they do not know the credentials such as a key or password. However, when these credentials are easily predictable or even fixed (as with default or hard-coded passwords and keys), then the attacker can defeat the mechanism without relying on brute force.\n\n\nCredentials may be weak for different reasons, such as:\n\n\n  - Hard-coded (i.e., static and unchangeable by the administrator)\n\n  - Default (i.e., the same static value across different deployments/installations, but able to be changed by the administrator)\n\n  - Predictable (i.e., generated in a way that produces unique credentials across deployments/installations, but can still be guessed with reasonable efficiency)\n\nEven if a new, unique credential is intended to be generated for each product installation, if the generation is predictable, then that may also simplify guessing attacks.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **[REF-1374]:** Chain: JavaScript-based cryptocurrency library can fall back to the insecure Math.random() function instead of reporting a failure (CWE-392), thus reducing the entropy (CWE-332) and leading to generation of non-unique cryptographic keys for Bitcoin wallets (CWE-1391)\n- **CVE-2022-30270:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses default credentials for some SSH accounts\n- **CVE-2022-29965:** Distributed Control System (DCS) uses a deterministic algorithm to generate utility passwords\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1241: Use of Predictable Algorithm in Random Number Generator\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe device uses an algorithm that is predictable and generates a pseudo-random number.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nPseudo-random number generator algorithms are predictable because their registers have a finite number of possible states, which eventually lead to repeating patterns. As a result, pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) can compromise their randomness or expose their internal state to various attacks, such as reverse engineering or tampering. It is highly recommended to use hardware-based true random number generators (TRNGs) to ensure the security of encryption schemes. TRNGs generate unpredictable, unbiased, and independent random numbers because they employ physical phenomena, e.g., electrical noise, as sources to generate random numbers.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-330\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, \"randomness\" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, \"entropy\" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-3692:** PHP framework uses mt_rand() function (Marsenne Twister) when generating tokens\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nTwo separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n### Extended Description\nIn security-relevant contexts, even small variations in timing can be exploited by attackers to indirectly infer certain details about the product's internal operations. For example, in some cryptographic algorithms, attackers can use timing differences to infer certain properties about a private key, making the key easier to guess. Timing discrepancies effectively form a timing side channel.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-203\nCanPrecede -> CWE-385\nCanPrecede -> CWE-327\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Often primary in cryptographic applications and algorithms.\n\n**[Maintenance]** CWE 4.16 removed a demonstrative example for a hardware module because it was inaccurate and unable to be adapted. The CWE team is developing an alternative.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-10071:** Java-oriented framework compares HMAC signatures using String.equals() instead of a constant-time algorithm, causing timing discrepancies\n- **CVE-2019-10482:** Smartphone OS uses comparison functions that are not in constant time, allowing side channels\n- **CVE-2014-0984:** Password-checking function in router terminates validation of a password entry when it encounters the first incorrect character, which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a brute-force attack that relies on timing differences in responses to incorrect password guesses, aka a timing side-channel attack.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-345\nChildOf -> CWE-345\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2002-1796:** Does not properly verify signatures for \"trusted\" entities.\n- **CVE-2005-2181:** Insufficient verification allows spoofing.\n- **CVE-2005-2182:** Insufficient verification allows spoofing.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g. \"eval\").\n\n### Extended Description\nThis may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, or at least modify what code can be executed.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-94\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** Factors: special character errors can play a role in increasing the variety of code that can be injected, although some vulnerabilities do not require special characters at all, e.g. when a single function without arguments can be referenced and a terminator character is not necessary.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-4181:** Framework for LLM applications allows eval injection via a crafted response from a hosting provider.\n- **CVE-2022-2054:** Python compiler uses eval() to execute malicious strings as Python code.\n- **CVE-2021-22204:** Chain: regex in EXIF processor code does not correctly determine where a string ends (CWE-625), enabling eval injection (CWE-95), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen product generates predictable values in a context requiring unpredictability, it may be possible for an attacker to guess the next value that will be generated, and use this guess to impersonate another user or access sensitive information.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-693\nCanPrecede -> CWE-804\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This can be primary to many other weaknesses such as cryptographic errors, authentication errors, symlink following, information leaks, and others.\n\n**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.3, CWE-330 and its descendants are being investigated by the CWE crypto team to identify gaps related to randomness and unpredictability, as well as the relationships between randomness and cryptographic primitives. This \"subtree analysis\" might result in the addition or deprecation of existing entries; the reorganization of relationships in some views, e.g. the research view (CWE-1000); more consistent use of terminology; and/or significant modifications to related entries.\n\n**[Maintenance]** As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, \"randomness\" is used heavily. However, within cryptography, \"entropy\" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other scenarios.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-3692:** PHP framework uses mt_rand() function (Marsenne Twister) when generating tokens\n- **CVE-2020-7010:** Cloud application on Kubernetes generates passwords using a weak random number generator based on deployment time.\n- **CVE-2009-3278:** Crypto product uses rand() library function to generate a recovery key, making it easier to conduct brute force attacks.\n\n",

Sometimes a mediocre source of randomness is sufficient or preferable for algorithms that use random numbers. Weak generators generally take less processing power and/or do not use the precious, finite, entropy sources on a system. While such PRNGs might have very useful features, these same features could be used to break the cryptography.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-3692: PHP framework uses mt_rand() function (Marsenne Twister) when generating tokens\n\n- CVE-2009-3278: Crypto product uses rand() library function to generate a recovery key, making it easier to conduct brute force attacks.\n\n- CVE-2009-3238: Random number generator can repeatedly generate the same value.\n\n- CVE-2009-2367: Web application generates predictable session IDs, allowing session hijacking.\n\n- CVE-2008-0166: SSL library uses a weak random number generator that only generates 65,536 unique keys.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-34430: Eclipse TinyDTLS through 0.9-rc1 relies on the rand function in the C library, which makes it easier for remote attackers to compute the master key and then decrypt DTLS traffic.\n\n- CVE-2021-43799: Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool. Zulip Server installs RabbitMQ for internal message passing. In versions of Zulip Server prior to 4.9, the initial installation (until first reboot, or restart of RabbitMQ) does not successfully limit the default ports which RabbitMQ opens; this includes port 25672, the RabbitMQ distribution port, which is used as a management port. RabbitMQ's default \"cookie\" which protects this port is generated using a weak PRNG, which limits the entropy of the password to at most 36 bits; in practicality, the seed for the randomizer is biased, resulting in approximately 20 bits of entropy. If other firewalls (at the OS or network level) do not protect port 25672, a remote attacker can brute-force the 20 bits of entropy in the \"cookie\" and leverage it for arbitrary execution of code as the rabbitmq user. They can also read all data which is sent through RabbitMQ, which includes all message traffic sent by users. Version 4.9 contains a patch for this vulnerability. As a workaround, ensure that firewalls prevent access to ports 5672 and 25672 from outside the Zulip server.\n\n- CVE-2021-45484: In NetBSD through 9.2, the IPv6 fragment ID generation algorithm employs a weak cryptographic PRNG.\n\n- CVE-2021-45489: In NetBSD through 9.2, the IPv6 Flow Label generation algorithm employs a weak cryptographic PRNG.\n\n- CVE-2022-29245: SSH.NET is a Secure Shell (SSH) library for .NET. In versions 2020.0.0 and 2020.0.1, during an `X25519` key exchange, the client\u2019s private key is generated with `System.Random`. `System.Random` is not a cryptographically secure random number generator, it must therefore not be used for cryptographic purposes. When establishing an SSH connection to a remote host, during the X25519 key exchange, the private key is generated with a weak random number generator whose seed can be brute forced. This allows an attacker who is able to eavesdrop on the communications to decrypt them. Version 2020.0.2 contains a patch for this issue.

They rely on cryptographically secure and unique seeds for entropy so proper seeding is critical to the secure operation of the PRNG.\n\n\n Management of seeds could be broken down into two main areas: \n\n\n  -  (1) protecting seeds as cryptographic material (such as a cryptographic key); \n\n  -  (2) whenever possible, using a uniquely generated seed from a cryptographically secure source \n\n PRNGs require a seed as input to generate a stream of numbers that are functionally indistinguishable from random numbers. While the output is, in many cases, sufficient for cryptographic uses, the output of any PRNG is directly determined by the seed provided as input. If the seed can be ascertained by a third party, the entire output of the PRNG can be made known to them. As such, the seed should be kept secret and should ideally not be able to be guessed. For example, the current time may be a poor seed. Knowing the approximate time the PRNG was seeded greatly reduces the possible key space. \n\n Seeds do not necessarily need to be unique, but reusing seeds may open up attacks if the seed is discovered. \n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-7010: Cloud application on Kubernetes generates passwords using a weak random number generator based on deployment time.\n\n- CVE-2019-11495: server uses erlang:now() to seed the PRNG, which results in a small search space for potential random seeds\n\n- CVE-2018-12520: Product's PRNG is not seeded for the generation of session IDs\n\n- CVE-2016-10180: Router's PIN generation is based on rand(time(0)) seeding.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-27211: steghide 0.5.1 relies on a certain 32-bit seed value, which makes it easier for attackers to detect hidden data.\n\n- CVE-2021-34600: Telenot CompasX versions prior to 32.0 use a weak seed for random number generation leading to predictable AES keys used in the NFC tags used for local authorization of users. This may lead to total loss of trustworthiness of the installation. \n\n- CVE-2021-41117: keypair is a a RSA PEM key generator written in javascript. keypair implements a lot of cryptographic primitives on its own or by borrowing from other libraries where possible, including node-forge. An issue was discovered where this library was generating identical RSA keys used in SSH. This would mean that the library is generating identical P, Q (and thus N) values which, in practical terms, is impossible with RSA-2048 keys. Generating identical values, repeatedly, usually indicates an issue with poor random number generation, or, poor handling of CSPRNG output. Issue 1: Poor random number generation (`GHSL-2021-1012`). The library does not rely entirely on a platform provided CSPRNG, rather, it uses it's own counter-based CMAC approach. Where things go wrong is seeding the CMAC implementation with \"true\" random data in the function `defaultSeedFile`. In order to seed the AES-CMAC generator, the library will take two different approaches depending on the JavaScript execution environment. In a browser, the library will use [`window.crypto.getRandomValues()`](https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/blob/87c62f255baa12c1ec4f98a91600f82af80be6db/index.js#L971). However, in a nodeJS execution environment, the `window` object is not defined, so it goes down a much less secure solution, also of which has a bug in it. It does look like the library tries to use node's CSPRNG when possible unfortunately, it looks like the `crypto` object is null because a variable was declared with the same name, and set to `null`. So the node CSPRNG path is never taken. However, when `window.crypto.getRandomValues()` is not available, a Lehmer LCG random number generator is used to seed the CMAC counter, and the LCG is seeded with `Math.random`. While this is poor and would likely qualify in a security bug in itself, it does not explain the extreme frequency in which duplicate keys occur. The main flaw: The output from the Lehmer LCG is encoded incorrectly. The specific [line][https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/blob/87c62f255baa12c1ec4f98a91600f82af80be6db/index.js#L1008] with the flaw is: `b.putByte(String.fromCharCode(next & 0xFF))` The [definition](https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/blob/87c62f255baa12c1ec4f98a91600f82af80be6db/index.js#L350-L352) of `putByte` is `util.ByteBuffer.prototype.putByte = function(b) {this.data += String.fromCharCode(b);};`. Simplified, this is `String.fromCharCode(String.fromCharCode(next & 0xFF))`. The double `String.fromCharCode` is almost certainly unintentional and the source of weak seeding. Unfortunately, this does not result in an error. Rather, it results most of the buffer containing zeros. Since we are masking with 0xFF, we can determine that 97% of the output from the LCG are converted to zeros. The only outputs that result in meaningful values are outputs 48 through 57, inclusive. The impact is that each byte in the RNG seed has a 97% chance of being 0 due to incorrect conversion. When it is not, the bytes are 0 through 9. In summary, there are three immediate concerns: 1. The library has an insecure random number fallback path. Ideally the library would require a strong CSPRNG instead of attempting to use a LCG and `Math.random`. 2. The library does not correctly use a strong random number generator when run in NodeJS, even though a strong CSPRNG is available. 3. The fallback path has an issue in the implementation where a majority of the seed data is going to effectively be zero. Due to the poor random number generation, keypair generates RSA keys that are relatively easy to guess. This could enable an attacker to decrypt confidential messages or gain authorized access to an account belonging to the victim.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-330 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-330 (ChildOf)",

In mod_auth_openidc before version 2.4.9, the AES GCM encryption in mod_auth_openidc uses a static IV and AAD. It is important to fix because this creates a static nonce and since aes-gcm is a stream cipher, this can lead to known cryptographic issues, since the same key is being reused. From 2.4.9 onwards this has been patched to use dynamic values through usage of cjose AES encryption routines.\n\n- CVE-2020-1472: An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when an attacker establishes a vulnerable Netlogon secure channel connection to a domain controller, using the Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC). An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run a specially crafted application on a device on the network. To exploit the vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker would be required to use MS-NRPC to connect to a domain controller to obtain domain administrator access. Microsoft is addressing the vulnerability in a phased two-part rollout. These updates address the vulnerability by modifying how Netlogon handles the usage of Netlogon secure channels. For guidelines on how to manage the changes required for this vulnerability and more information on the phased rollout, see How to manage the changes in Netlogon secure channel connections associated with CVE-2020-1472 (updated September 28, 2020).

Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.\n\n\nIt is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.\n\n\nSince the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered \"unsafe\" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.\n\n\nFor a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-30273: SCADA-based protocol supports a legacy encryption mode that uses Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB mode, which leaks patterns in messages and cannot protect integrity\n\n- CVE-2022-30320: Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) uses a protocol with a cryptographically insecure hashing algorithm for passwords.\n\n- CVE-2008-3775: Product uses \"ROT-25\" to obfuscate the password in the registry.\n\n- CVE-2007-4150: product only uses \"XOR\" to obfuscate sensitive data\n\n- CVE-2007-5460: product only uses \"XOR\" and a fixed key to obfuscate sensitive data\n\n- CVE-2005-4860: Product substitutes characters with other characters in a fixed way, and also leaves certain input characters unchanged.\n\n- CVE-2002-2058: Attackers can infer private IP addresses by dividing each octet by the MD5 hash of '20'.\n\n- CVE-2008-3188: Product uses DES when MD5 has been specified in the configuration, resulting in weaker-than-expected password hashes.\n\n- CVE-2005-2946: Default configuration of product uses MD5 instead of stronger algorithms that are available, simplifying forgery of certificates.\n\n- CVE-2007-6013: Product uses the hash of a hash for authentication, allowing attackers to gain privileges if they can obtain the original hash.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-15128: In OctoberCMS before version 1.0.468, encrypted cookie values were not tied to the name of the cookie the value belonged to. This meant that certain classes of attacks that took advantage of other theoretical vulnerabilities in user facing code (nothing exploitable in the core project itself) had a higher chance of succeeding. Specifically, if your usage exposed a way for users to provide unfiltered user input and have it returned to them as an encrypted cookie (ex. storing a user provided search query in a cookie) they could then use the generated cookie in place of other more tightly controlled cookies; or if your usage exposed the plaintext version of an encrypted cookie at any point to the user they could theoretically provide encrypted content from your application back to it as an encrypted cookie and force the framework to decrypt it for them.

A remote attacker with read and write access to network data could exploit this vulnerability to display plaintext bits from a block of ciphertext and obtain sensitive information. This issue affects all Juniper Networks SRC Series versions prior to 4.13.0-R6.\n\n- CVE-2021-36298: Dell EMC InsightIQ, versions prior to 4.1.4, contain risky cryptographic algorithms in the SSH component. A remote unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to authentication bypass and remote takeover of the InsightIQ. This allows an attacker to take complete control of InsightIQ to affect services provided by SSH; so Dell recommends customers to upgrade at the earliest opportunity.\n\n- CVE-2021-41263: rails_multisite provides multi-db support for Rails applications. In affected versions this vulnerability impacts any Rails applications using `rails_multisite` alongside Rails' signed/encrypted cookies. Depending on how the application makes use of these cookies, it may be possible for an attacker to re-use cookies on different 'sites' within a multi-site Rails application. The issue has been patched in v4 of the `rails_multisite` gem. Note that this upgrade will invalidate all previous signed/encrypted cookies. The impact of this invalidation will vary based on the application architecture.\n\n- CVE-2021-32001: K3s in SUSE Rancher allows any user with direct access to the datastore, or a copy of a datastore backup, to extract the cluster's confidential keying material (cluster certificate authority private keys, secrets encryption configuration passphrase, etc.) and decrypt it, without having to know the token value. This issue affects: SUSE Rancher K3s version v1.19.12+k3s1, v1.20.8+k3s1, v1.21.2+k3s1 and prior versions; RKE2 version v1.19.12+rke2r1, v1.20.8+rke2r1, v1.21.2+rke2r1 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2020-36315: In RELIC before 2020-08-01, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature forgery can occur because certain checks of the padding (and of the first two bytes) are inadequate.

Laravel prior to versions 8.75.0, 7.30.6, and 6.20.42 contain a possible cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Blade templating engine. A broken HTML element may be clicked and the user taken to another location in their browser due to XSS. This is due to the user being able to guess the parent placeholder SHA-1 hash by trying common names of sections. If the parent template contains an exploitable HTML structure an XSS vulnerability can be exposed. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 8.75.0, 7.30.6, and 6.20.42 by determining the parent placeholder at runtime and using a random hash that is unique to each request.\n\n- CVE-2021-31562: The SSL/TLS configuration of Fresenius Kabi Agilia Link + version 3.0 has serious deficiencies that may allow an attacker to compromise SSL/TLS sessions in different ways. An attacker may be able to eavesdrop on transferred data, manipulate data allegedly secured by SSL/TLS, and impersonate an entity to gain access to sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-2351: Vulnerability in the Advanced Networking Option component of Oracle Database Server. Supported versions that are affected are 12.1.0.2, 12.2.0.1 and 19c. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via Oracle Net to compromise Advanced Networking Option. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Advanced Networking Option, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Advanced Networking Option. Note: The July 2021 Critical Patch Update introduces a number of Native Network Encryption changes to deal with vulnerability CVE-2021-2351 and prevent the use of weaker ciphers.

An attacker that obtained access to the administrative web interface of a printer (e.g., by using the default credentials) can download the address book file, which contains the list of users (domain users, FTP users, etc.) stored on the printer, together with their encrypted passwords. The passwords are protected by a weak cipher, such as ROT13, which requires minimal effort to instantly retrieve the original password, giving the attacker a list of valid domain or FTP usernames and passwords.\n\n- CVE-2021-43989: mySCADA myPRO Versions 8.20.0 and prior stores passwords using MD5, which may allow an attacker to crack the previously retrieved password hashes.\n\n- CVE-2021-45512: Certain NETGEAR devices are affected by weak cryptography. This affects D7000v2 before 1.0.0.62, D8500 before 1.0.3.50, EX3700 before 1.0.0.84, EX3800 before 1.0.0.84, EX6120 before 1.0.0.54, EX6130 before 1.0.0.36, EX7000 before 1.0.1.90, R6250 before 1.0.4.42, R6400v2 before 1.0.4.98, R6700v3 before 1.0.4.98, R6900P before 1.3.2.124, R7000 before 1.0.11.106, R7000P before 1.3.2.124, R7100LG before 1.0.0.56, R7900 before 1.0.4.26, R8000 before 1.0.4.58, R8300 before 1.0.2.134, R8500 before 1.0.2.134, RS400 before 1.5.0.48, WNR3500Lv2 before 1.2.0.62, and XR300 before 1.0.3.50.\n\n- CVE-2021-45696: An issue was discovered in the sha2 crate 0.9.7 before 0.9.8 for Rust. Hashes of long messages may be incorrect when the AVX2-accelerated backend is used.\n\n- CVE-2022-0377: Users of the LearnPress WordPress plugin before 4.1.5 can upload an image as a profile avatar after the registration. After this process the user crops and saves the image. Then a \"POST\" request that contains user supplied name of the image is sent to the server for renaming and cropping of the image. As a result of this request, the name of the user-supplied image is changed with a MD5 value. This process can be conducted only when type of the image is JPG or PNG. An attacker can use this vulnerability in order to rename an arbitrary image file. By doing this, they could destroy the design of the web site.\n\n- CVE-2022-1252: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm in GitHub repository gnuboard/gnuboard5 prior to and including 5.5.5. A vulnerability in gnuboard v5.5.5 and below uses weak encryption algorithms leading to sensitive information exposure. This allows an attacker to derive the email address of any user, including when the 'Let others see my information.' box is ticked off. Or to send emails to any email address, with full control of its contents \n\n- CVE-2022-1434: The OpenSSL 3.0 implementation of the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite incorrectly uses the AAD data as the MAC key. This makes the MAC key trivially predictable. An attacker could exploit this issue by performing a man-in-the-middle attack to modify data being sent from one endpoint to an OpenSSL 3.0 recipient such that the modified data would still pass the MAC integrity check. Note that data sent from an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will always be rejected by the recipient and the connection will fail at that point. Many application protocols require data to be sent from the client to the server first. Therefore, in such a case, only an OpenSSL 3.0 server would be impacted when talking to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 client. If both endpoints are OpenSSL 3.0 then the attacker could modify data being sent in both directions. In this case both clients and servers could be affected, regardless of the application protocol. Note that in the absence of an attacker this bug means that an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint communicating with a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will fail to complete the handshake when using this ciphersuite. The confidentiality of data is not impacted by this issue, i.e. an attacker cannot decrypt data that has been encrypted using this ciphersuite - they can only modify it. In order for this attack to work both endpoints must legitimately negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite. This ciphersuite is not compiled by default in OpenSSL 3.0, and is not available within the default provider or the default ciphersuite list. This ciphersuite will never be used if TLSv1.3 has been negotiated. In order for an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to use this ciphersuite the following must have occurred: 1) OpenSSL must have been compiled with the (non-default) compile time option enable-weak-ssl-ciphers 2) OpenSSL must have had the legacy provider explicitly loaded (either through application code or via configuration) 3) The ciphersuite must have been explicitly added to the ciphersuite list 4) The libssl security level must have been set to 0 (default is 1) 5) A version of SSL/TLS below TLSv1.3 must have been negotiated 6) Both endpoints must negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite in preference to any others that both endpoints have in common Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2).\n\n- CVE-2022-20805: A vulnerability in the automatic decryption process in Cisco Umbrella Secure Web Gateway (SWG) could allow an authenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass the SSL decryption and content filtering policies on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to how the decryption function uses the TLS Sever Name Indication (SNI) extension of an HTTP request to discover the destination domain and determine if the request needs to be decrypted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request over TLS from a client to an unknown or controlled URL. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to bypass the decryption process of Cisco Umbrella SWG and allow malicious content to be downloaded to a host on a protected network. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-2097: AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimised implementation will not encrypt the entirety of the data under some circumstances. This could reveal sixteen bytes of data that was preexisting in the memory that wasn't written. In the special case of \"in place\" encryption, sixteen bytes of the plaintext would be revealed. Since OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and DTLS, they are both unaffected. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.5 (Affected 3.0.0-3.0.4). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1q (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1p).\n\n- CVE-2022-2781: In affected versions of Octopus Server it was identified that the same encryption process was used for both encrypting session cookies and variables.\n\n- CVE-2022-28164: Brocade SANnav before SANnav 2.2.0 application uses the Blowfish symmetric encryption algorithm for the storage of passwords. This could allow an authenticated attacker to decrypt stored account passwords.\n\n- CVE-2022-28382: An issue was discovered in certain Verbatim drives through 2022-03-31. Due to the use of an insecure encryption AES mode (Electronic Codebook, aka ECB), an attacker may be able to extract information even from encrypted data, for example by observing repeating byte patterns. The firmware of the USB-to-SATA bridge controller INIC-3637EN uses AES-256 with the ECB mode. This operation mode of block ciphers (e.g., AES) always encrypts identical plaintext data, in this case blocks of 16 bytes, to identical ciphertext data. For some data, for instance bitmap images, the lack of the cryptographic property called diffusion, within ECB, can leak sensitive information even in encrypted data. Thus, the use of the ECB operation mode can put the confidentiality of specific information at risk, even in an encrypted form. This affects Keypad Secure USB 3.2 Gen 1 Drive Part Number #49428, Store 'n' Go Secure Portable HDD GD25LK01-3637-C VER4.0, Executive Fingerprint Secure SSD GDMSFE01-INI3637-C VER1.1, and Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive Part Number #53650.\n\n- CVE-2022-29960: Emerson OpenBSI through 2022-04-29 uses weak cryptography. It is an engineering environment for the ControlWave and Bristol Babcock line of RTUs. DES with hardcoded cryptographic keys is used for protection of certain system credentials, engineering files, and sensitive utilities.\n\n- CVE-2022-30320: Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD through 2022-05-06 uses a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm. According to FSCT-2022-0063, there is a Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD S-Bus weak credential hashing scheme issue. The affected components are characterized as: S-Bus (5050/UDP) authentication. The potential impact is: Authentication bypass. The Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD controllers utilize the S-Bus protocol (5050/UDP) for a variety of engineering purposes. It is possible to configure a password in order to restrict access to sensitive engineering functionality. Authentication is done by using the S-Bus 'write byte' message to a specific address and supplying a hashed version of the password. The hashing algorithm used is based on CRC-16 and as such not cryptographically secure. An insecure hashing algorithm is used. An attacker capable of passively observing traffic can intercept the hashed credentials and trivially find collisions allowing for authentication without having to bruteforce a keyspace defined by the actual strength of the password. This allows the attacker access to sensitive engineering functionality such as uploading/downloading control logic and manipulating controller configuration.\n\n- CVE-2022-35513: The Blink1Control2 application <= 2.2.7 uses weak password encryption and an insecure method of storage.\n\n- CVE-2022-38493: Rhonabwy 0.9.99 through 1.1.x before 1.1.7 doesn't check the RSA private key length before RSA-OAEP decryption. This allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service via a crafted JWE (JSON Web Encryption) token.\n\n- CVE-2022-39237: syslabs/sif is the Singularity Image Format (SIF) reference implementation. In versions prior to 2.8.1the `github.com/sylabs/sif/v2/pkg/integrity` package did not verify that the hash algorithm(s) used are cryptographically secure when verifying digital signatures. A patch is available in version >= v2.8.1 of the module. Users are encouraged to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may independently validate that the hash algorithm(s) used for metadata digest(s) and signature hash are cryptographically secure.\n\n- CVE-2022-28166: In Brocade SANnav version before SANN2.2.0.2 and Brocade SANNav before 2.1.1.8, the implementation of TLS/SSL Server Supports the Use of Static Key Ciphers (ssl-static-key-ciphers) on ports 443 & 18082.\n\n- CVE-2022-30187: Azure Storage Library Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-23839: OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate SSLv2 with a server that is configured to support both SSLv2 and more recent SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version rollback attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or TLS versions greater than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form of padding. A server that supports greater than SSLv2 is supposed to reject connection attempts from a client where this special form of padding is present, because this indicates that a version rollback has occurred (i.e. both client and server support greater than SSLv2, and yet this is the version that is being requested). The implementation of this padding check inverted the logic so that the connection attempt is accepted if the padding is present, and rejected if it is absent. This means that such as server will accept a connection if a version rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously reject a connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made. Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x are affected by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1) have configured SSLv2 support at compile time (this is off by default), 2) have configured SSLv2 support at runtime (this is off by default), 3) have configured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default ciphersuite list) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore is not vulnerable to this issue. The underlying error is in the implementation of the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function. This also affects the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. Although 1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function still exists, as does the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode. Applications that directly call that function or use that padding mode will encounter this issue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1 this is considered a bug and not a security issue in that version. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2s-1.0.2x).\n\n- CVE-2021-20379: IBM Guardium Data Encryption (GDE) 3.0.0.3 and 4.0.0.4 uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms that could allow an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information. IBM X-Force ID: 195711.\n\n- CVE-2021-20406: IBM Security Verify Information Queue 1.0.6 and 1.0.7 uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms that could allow an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information.

IBM X-Force ID: 197969\n\n- CVE-2021-20566: IBM Resilient SOAR V38.0 uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms that could allow an attacker to decrypt highly sensitive information. IBM X-Force ID: 199238.\n\n- CVE-2021-22212: ntpkeygen can generate keys that ntpd fails to parse. NTPsec 1.2.0 allows ntpkeygen to generate keys with '#' characters. ntpd then either pads, shortens the key, or fails to load these keys entirely, depending on the key type and the placement of the '#'. This results in the administrator not being able to use the keys as expected or the keys are shorter than expected and easier to brute-force, possibly resulting in MITM attacks between ntp clients and ntp servers. For short AES128 keys, ntpd generates a warning that it is padding them.\n\n- CVE-2021-22356: There is a weak secure algorithm vulnerability in Huawei products. A weak secure algorithm is used in a module. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by capturing and analyzing the messages between devices to obtain information. This can lead to information leak.Affected product versions include: IPS Module V500R005C00SPC100, V500R005C00SPC200; NGFW Module V500R005C00SPC100, V500R005C00SPC200; Secospace USG6300 V500R001C30SPC200, V500R001C30SPC600, V500R001C60SPC500, V500R005C00SPC100, V500R005C00SPC200; Secospace USG6500 V500R001C30SPC200, V500R001C30SPC600, V500R001C60SPC500, V500R005C00SPC100, V500R005C00SPC200; Secospace USG6600 V500R001C30SPC200, V500R001C30SPC600, V500R001C60SPC500, V500R005C00SPC100, V500R005C00SPC200; USG9500 V500R001C30SPC200, V500R001C30SPC600, V500R001C60SPC500, V500R005C00SPC100, V500R005C00SPC200.\n\n- CVE-2021-22738: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm vulnerability exists in homeLYnk (Wiser For KNX) and spaceLYnk V2.60 and prior that could cause unauthorized access when credentials are discovered after a brute force attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-25763: In JetBrains Ktor before 1.4.2, weak cipher suites were enabled by default.\n\n- CVE-2021-27756: \"TLS-RSA cipher suites are not disabled in BigFix Compliance up to v2.0.5.

Versions 2.2 and earlier for release builds and versions 425 and earlier for nightly builds suffer from use of a weak cryptographic algorithm (RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding). The issue will be patched in v2.3 for release builds and 426 onwards for nightly builds. As a workaround, one may disable an advance security feature if not required.\n\n- CVE-2021-41278: Functions SDK for EdgeX is meant to provide all the plumbing necessary for developers to get started in processing/transforming/exporting data out of the EdgeX IoT platform. In affected versions broken encryption in app-functions-sdk \u201cAES\u201d transform in EdgeX Foundry releases prior to Jakarta allows attackers to decrypt messages via unspecified vectors. The app-functions-sdk exports an \u201caes\u201d transform that user scripts can optionally call to encrypt data in the processing pipeline. No decrypt function is provided. Encryption is not enabled by default, but if used, the level of protection may be less than the user may expects due to a broken implementation. Version v2.1.0 (EdgeX Foundry Jakarta release and later) of app-functions-sdk-go/v2 deprecates the \u201caes\u201d transform and provides an improved \u201caes256\u201d transform in its place. The broken implementation will remain in a deprecated state until it is removed in the next EdgeX major release to avoid breakage of existing software that depends on the broken implementation. As the broken transform is a library function that is not invoked by default, users who do not use the AES transform in their processing pipelines are unaffected.

However, when these credentials are easily predictable or even fixed (as with default or hard-coded passwords and keys), then the attacker can defeat the mechanism without relying on brute force.\n\n\nCredentials may be weak for different reasons, such as:\n\n\n  - Hard-coded (i.e., static and unchangeable by the administrator)\n\n  - Default (i.e., the same static value across different deployments/installations, but able to be changed by the administrator)\n\n  - Predictable (i.e., generated in a way that produces unique credentials across deployments/installations, but can still be guessed with reasonable efficiency)\n\nEven if a new, unique credential is intended to be generated for each product installation, if the generation is predictable, then that may also simplify guessing attacks.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- [REF-1374]: Chain: JavaScript-based cryptocurrency library can fall back to the insecure Math.random() function instead of reporting a failure (CWE-392), thus reducing the entropy (CWE-332) and leading to generation of non-unique cryptographic keys for Bitcoin wallets (CWE-1391)\n\n- CVE-2022-30270: Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses default credentials for some SSH accounts\n\n- CVE-2022-29965: Distributed Control System (DCS) uses a deterministic algorithm to generate utility passwords\n\n- CVE-2022-30271: Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used in typical deployments\n\n- CVE-2021-38759: microcontroller board has default password, allowing admin access\n\n- CVE-2021-41192: data visualization/sharing package uses default secret keys or cookie values if they are not specified in environment variables\n\n- CVE-2020-8994: UART interface for AI speaker uses empty password for root shell\n\n- CVE-2020-27020: password manager does not generate cryptographically strong passwords, allowing prediction of passwords using guessable details such as time of generation\n\n- CVE-2020-8632: password generator for cloud application has small length value, making it easier for brute-force guessing\n\n- CVE-2020-5365: network-attached storage (NAS) system has predictable default passwords for a diagnostics/support account\n\n- CVE-2020-5248: IT asset management app has a default encryption key that is the same across installations\n\n- CVE-2018-3825: cloud cluster management product has a default master encryption key\n\n- CVE-2012-3503: Installation script has a hard-coded secret token value, allowing attackers to bypass authentication\n\n- CVE-2010-2306: Intrusion Detection System (IDS) uses the same static, private SSL keys for multiple devices and installations, allowing decryption of SSL traffic\n\n- CVE-2001-0618: Residential gateway uses the last 5 digits of the 'Network Name' or SSID as the default WEP key, which allows attackers to get the key by sniffing the SSID, which is sent in the clear\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-3875: A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Click Studios Passwordstate and Passwordstate Browser Extension Chrome. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the component API. The manipulation leads to authentication bypass by assumed-immutable data. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-216244.\n\n- CVE-2021-3979: A key length flaw was found in Red Hat Ceph Storage. An attacker can exploit the fact that the key length is incorrectly passed in an encryption algorithm to create a non random key, which is weaker and can be exploited for loss of confidentiality and integrity on encrypted disks.\n\n- CVE-2021-42949: The component controlla_login function in HotelDruid Hotel Management Software v3.0.3 generates a predictable session token, allowing attackers to bypass authentication via bruteforce attacks.\n\n- CVE-2022-23555: authentik is an open-source Identity Provider focused on flexibility and versatility. Versions prior to 2022.11.4 and 2022.10.4 are vulnerable to Improper Authentication. Token reuse in invitation URLs leads to access control bypass via the use of a different enrollment flow than in the one provided. The vulnerability allows an attacker that knows different invitation flows names (e.g. `enrollment-invitation-test` and `enrollment-invitation-admin`) via either different invite links or via brute forcing to signup via a single invitation url for any valid invite link received (it can even be a url for a third flow as long as it's a valid invite) as the token used in the `Invitations` section of the Admin interface does NOT change when a different `enrollment flow` is selected via the interface and it is NOT bound to the selected flow, so it will be valid for any flow when used. This issue is patched in authentik 2022.11.4,2022.10.4 and 2022.12.0. Only configurations that use invitations and have multiple enrollment flows with invitation stages that grant different permissions are affected. The default configuration is not vulnerable, and neither are configurations with a single enrollment flow. As a workaround, fixed data can be added to invitations which can be checked in the flow to deny requests. Alternatively, an identifier with high entropy (like a UUID) can be used as flow slug, mitigating the attack vector by exponentially decreasing the possibility of discovering other flows.\n\n- CVE-2022-28376: Verizon 5G Home LVSKIHP outside devices through 2022-02-15 allow anyone (knowing the device's serial number) to access a CPE admin website, e.g., at the 10.0.0.1 IP address. The password (for the verizon username) is calculated by concatenating the serial number and the model (i.e., the LVSKIHP string), running the sha256sum program, and extracting the first seven characters concatenated with the last seven characters of that SHA-256 value.\n\n- CVE-2022-34919: The file upload wizard in Zengenti Contensis Classic before 15.2.1.79 does not correctly check that a user has authenticated. By uploading a crafted aspx file, it is possible to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n- CVE-2022-40494: NPS before v0.26.10 was discovered to contain an authentication bypass vulnerability via constantly generating and sending the Auth key and Timestamp parameters.\n\n- CVE-2021-41506: Xiaongmai AHB7008T-MH-V2, AHB7804R-ELS, AHB7804R-MH-V2, AHB7808R-MS-V2, AHB7808R-MS, AHB7808T-MS-V2, AHB7804R-LMS, HI3518_50H10L_S39 V4.02.R11.7601.Nat.Onvif.20170420, V4.02.R11.Nat.Onvif.20160422, V4.02.R11.7601.Nat.Onvif.20170424, V4.02.R11.Nat.Onvif.20170327, V4.02.R11.Nat.Onvif.20161205, V4.02.R11.Nat.20170301, V4.02.R12.Nat.OnvifS.20170727 is affected by a backdoor in the macGuarder and dvrHelper binaries of DVR/NVR/IP camera firmware due to static root account credentials in the system.\n\n- CVE-2022-43917:  IBM WebSphere Application Server 8.5 and 9.0 traditional container uses weaker than expected cryptographic keys that could allow an attacker to decrypt sensitive information. This affects only the containerized version of WebSphere Application Server traditional. IBM X-Force ID: 241045. \n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-1390 (ChildOf)",

BLS signature validation in lotus uses blst library method VerifyCompressed. This method accepts signatures in 2 forms: \"serialized\", and \"compressed\", meaning that BLS signatures can be provided as either of 2 unique byte arrays. Lotus block validation functions perform a uniqueness check on provided blocks. Two blocks are considered distinct if the CIDs of their blockheader do not match. The CID method for blockheader includes the BlockSig of the block. The result of these issues is that it would be possible to punish miners for valid blocks, as there are two different valid block CIDs available for each block, even though this must be unique. By switching from the go based `blst` bindings over to the bindings in `filecoin-ffi`, the code paths now ensure that all signatures are compressed by size and the way they are deserialized. This happened in https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5393.\n\n- CVE-2020-23533: Union Pay up to 1.2.0, for web based versions contains a CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability, allows attackers to shop for free in merchants' websites and mobile apps, via a crafted authentication code (MAC) which is generated based on a secret key which is NULL.\n\n- CVE-2021-0152: Improper verification of cryptographic signature in the installer for some Intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R) and Killer(TM) Bluetooth(R) products in Windows 10 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-21238: PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. All users of pysaml2 that need to validate signed SAML documents are impacted. The vulnerability is a variant of XML Signature wrapping because it did not validate the SAML document against an XML schema.

This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21239: PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. Users of pysaml2 that use the default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. PySAML2 does not ensure that a signed SAML document is correctly signed. The default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend is using the xmlsec1 binary to verify the signature of signed SAML documents, but by default xmlsec1 accepts any type of key found within the given document. xmlsec1 needs to be configured explicitly to only use only _x509 certificates_ for the verification process of the SAML document signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-22708: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could allow an attacker to craft a malicious firmware package and bypass the signature verification mechanism.\n\n- CVE-2021-22734: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in homeLYnk (Wiser For KNX) and spaceLYnk V2.60 and prior which could cause remote code execution when an attacker loads unauthorized code.\n\n- CVE-2021-22735: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists inhomeLYnk (Wiser For KNX) and spaceLYnk V2.60 and prior which could allow remote code execution when unauthorized code is copied to the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-28091: Lasso all versions prior to 2.7.0 has improper verification of a cryptographic signature.\n\n- CVE-2021-3033: An improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks Prisma Cloud Compute console.

In versions prior to 7.0.3, the `verifyWithMessage` method of `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey` always returns `true` for any signature that has a SHA-512 hash matching the SHA-512 hash of the message even if the signature was invalid. This issue is patched in version 7.0.3. As a workaround: In `tenvoy.js` under the `verifyWithMessage` method definition within the `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey` class, ensure that the return statement call to `this.verify` ends in `.verified`.\n\n- CVE-2021-32738: js-stellar-sdk is a Javascript library for communicating with a Stellar Horizon server. The `Utils.readChallengeTx` function used in SEP-10 Stellar Web Authentication states in its function documentation that it reads and validates the challenge transaction including verifying that the `serverAccountID` has signed the transaction. In js-stellar-sdk before version 8.2.3, the function does not verify that the server has signed the transaction. Applications that also used `Utils.verifyChallengeTxThreshold` or `Utils.verifyChallengeTxSigners` to verify the signatures including the server signature on the challenge transaction are unaffected as those functions verify the server signed the transaction. Applications calling `Utils.readChallengeTx` should update to version 8.2.3, the first version with a patch for this vulnerability, to ensure that the challenge transaction is completely valid and signed by the server creating the challenge transaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-37927: Zoho ManageEngine ADManager Plus version 7110 and prior allows account takeover via SSO.\n\n- CVE-2021-29108: There is an privilege escalation vulnerability in organization-specific logins in Esri Portal for ArcGIS versions 10.9 and below that may allow a remote, authenticated attacker who is able to intercept and modify a SAML assertion to impersonate another account (XML Signature Wrapping Attack). In addition patching, Esri also strongly recommends as best practice for SAML assertions to be signed and encrypted.\n\n- CVE-2021-20156: Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 contains an improper access control configuration that could allow for a malicious firmware update. It is possible to manually install firmware that may be malicious in nature as there does not appear to be any signature validation done to determine if it is from a known and trusted source. This includes firmware updates that are done via the automated \"check for updates\" in the admin interface. If an attacker is able to masquerade as the update server, the device will not verify that the firmware updates downloaded are legitimate.\n\n- CVE-2020-1464: A spoofing vulnerability exists when Windows incorrectly validates file signatures. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass security features and load improperly signed files. In an attack scenario, an attacker could bypass security features intended to prevent improperly signed files from being loaded. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows validates file signatures. \n\n- CVE-2020-2021: When Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication is enabled and the 'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is disabled (unchecked), improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS SAML authentication enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to access protected resources. The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable server to exploit this vulnerability. This issue affects PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.3; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.9; PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.15, and all versions of PAN-OS 8.0 (EOL). This issue does not affect PAN-OS 7.1. This issue cannot be exploited if SAML is not used for authentication. This issue cannot be exploited if the 'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is enabled (checked) in the SAML Identity Provider Server Profile. Resources that can be protected by SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) authentication are: GlobalProtect Gateway, GlobalProtect Portal, GlobalProtect Clientless VPN, Authentication and Captive Portal, PAN-OS next-generation firewalls (PA-Series, VM-Series) and Panorama web interfaces, Prisma Access In the case of GlobalProtect Gateways, GlobalProtect Portal, Clientless VPN, Captive Portal, and Prisma Access, an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the affected servers can gain access to protected resources if allowed by configured authentication and Security policies. There is no impact on the integrity and availability of the gateway, portal or VPN server. An attacker cannot inspect or tamper with sessions of regular users. In the worst case, this is a critical severity vulnerability with a CVSS Base Score of 10.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N). In the case of PAN-OS and Panorama web interfaces, this issue allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the PAN-OS or Panorama web interfaces to log in as an administrator and perform administrative actions. In the worst-case scenario, this is a critical severity vulnerability with a CVSS Base Score of 10.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). If the web interfaces are only accessible to a restricted management network, then the issue is lowered to a CVSS Base Score of 9.6 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious attempts to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-32977: AVEVA System Platform versions 2017 through 2020 R2 P01 does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data.\n\n- CVE-2021-35097: Possible authentication bypass due to improper order of signature verification and hashing in the signature verification call in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-35113: Possible authentication bypass due to improper order of signature verification and hashing in the signature verification call in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-36277: Dell Command | Update, Dell Update, and Alienware Update versions before 4.3 contains an Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature Vulnerability. A local authenticated malicious user may exploit this vulnerability by executing arbitrary code on the system.\n\n- CVE-2021-43074: An improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability [CWE-347] in FortiWeb 6.4 all versions, 6.3.16 and below, 6.2 all versions, 6.1 all versions, 6.0 all versions; FortiOS 7.0.3 and below, 6.4.8 and below, 6.2 all versions, 6.0 all versions; FortiSwitch 7.0.3 and below, 6.4.10 and below, 6.2 all versions, 6.0 all versions; FortiProxy 7.0.1 and below, 2.0.7 and below, 1.2 all versions, 1.1 all versions, 1.0 all versions may allow an attacker to decrypt portions of the administrative session management cookie if able to intercept the latter.\n\n- CVE-2022-1739: The tested version of Dominion Voting Systems ImageCast X does not validate application signatures to a trusted root certificate. Use of a trusted root certificate ensures software installed on a device is traceable to, or verifiable against, a cryptographic key provided by the manufacturer to detect tampering. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to install malicious code, which could also be spread to other vulnerable ImageCast X devices via removable media.\n\n- CVE-2022-20929: A vulnerability in the upgrade signature verification of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to provide an unauthentic upgrade file for upload. This vulnerability is due to insufficient cryptographic signature verification of upgrade files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing an administrator with an unauthentic upgrade file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to fully compromise the Cisco NFVIS system.\n\n- CVE-2022-23507: Tendermint is a high-performance blockchain consensus engine for Byzantine fault tolerant applications. Versions prior to 0.28.0 contain a potential attack via Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature, affecting anyone using the tendermint-light-client and related packages to perform light client verification (e.g. IBC-rs, Hermes). The light client does not check that the chain IDs of the trusted and untrusted headers match, resulting in a possible attack vector where someone who finds a header from an untrusted chain that satisfies all other verification conditions (e.g. enough overlapping validator signatures) could fool a light client. The attack vector is currently theoretical, and no proof-of-concept exists yet to exploit it on live networks. This issue is patched in version 0.28.0. There are no workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24759: `@chainsafe/libp2p-noise` contains TypeScript implementation of noise protocol, an encryption protocol used in libp2p. `@chainsafe/libp2p-noise` before 4.1.2 and 5.0.3 does not correctly validate signatures during the handshake process. This may allow a man-in-the-middle to pose as other peers and get those peers banned. Users should upgrade to version 4.1.2 or 5.0.3 to receive a patch. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-25898: The package jsrsasign before 10.5.25 are vulnerable to Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature when JWS or JWT signature with non Base64URL encoding special characters or number escaped characters may be validated as valid by mistake. Workaround: Validate JWS or JWT signature if it has Base64URL and dot safe string before executing JWS.verify() or JWS.verifyJWT() method.\n\n- CVE-2022-2790: Emerson Electric's Proficy Machine Edition Version 9.00 and prior is vulenrable to CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature, and does not properly verify compiled logic (PDT files) and data blocks data (BLD/BLK files).\n\n- CVE-2022-31156: Gradle is a build tool. Dependency verification is a security feature in Gradle Build Tool that was introduced to allow validation of external dependencies either through their checksum or cryptographic signatures. In versions 6.2 through 7.4.2, there are some cases in which Gradle may skip that verification and accept a dependency that would otherwise fail the build as an untrusted external artifact. This can occur in two ways. When signature verification is disabled but the verification metadata contains entries for dependencies that only have a `gpg` element but no `checksum` element. When signature verification is enabled, the verification metadata contains entries for dependencies with a `gpg` element but there is no signature file on the remote repository. In both cases, the verification will accept the dependency, skipping signature verification and not complaining that the dependency has no checksum entry. For builds that are vulnerable, there are two risks. Gradle could download a malicious binary from a repository outside your organization due to name squatting. For those still using HTTP only and not HTTPS for downloading dependencies, the build could download a malicious library instead of the expected one. Gradle 7.5 patches this issue by making sure to run checksum verification if signature verification cannot be completed, whatever the reason. Two workarounds are available: Remove all `gpg` elements from dependency verification metadata if you disable signature validation and/or avoid adding `gpg` entries for dependencies that do not have signature files.\n\n- CVE-2022-31206: The Omron SYSMAC Nx product family PLCs (NJ series, NY series, NX series, and PMAC series) through 2022-005-18 lack cryptographic authentication. These PLCs are programmed using the SYMAC Studio engineering software (which compiles IEC 61131-3 conformant POU code to native machine code for execution by the PLC's runtime). The resulting machine code is executed by a runtime, typically controlled by a real-time operating system. The logic that is downloaded to the PLC does not seem to be cryptographically authenticated, allowing an attacker to manipulate transmitted object code to the PLC and execute arbitrary machine code on the processor of the PLC's CPU module in the context of the runtime. In the case of at least the NJ series, an RTOS and hardware combination is used that would potentially allow for memory protection and privilege separation and thus limit the impact of code execution. However, it was not confirmed whether these sufficiently segment the runtime from the rest of the RTOS.\n\n- CVE-2022-31207: The Omron SYSMAC Cx product family PLCs (CS series, CJ series, and CP series) through 2022-05-18 lack cryptographic authentication. They utilize the Omron FINS (9600/TCP) protocol for engineering purposes, including downloading projects and control logic to the PLC. This protocol has authentication flaws as reported in FSCT-2022-0057. Control logic is downloaded to PLC volatile memory using the FINS Program Area Read and Program Area Write commands or to non-volatile memory using other commands from where it can be loaded into volatile memory for execution. The logic that is loaded into and executed from the user program area exists in compiled object code form. Upon execution, these object codes are first passed to a dedicated ASIC that determines whether the object code is to be executed by the ASIC or the microprocessor. In the former case, the object code is interpreted by the ASIC whereas in the latter case the object code is passed to the microprocessor for object code interpretation by a ROM interpreter. In the abnormal case where the object code cannot be handled by either, an abnormal condition is triggered and the PLC is halted. The logic that is downloaded to the PLC does not seem to be cryptographically authenticated, thus allowing an attacker to manipulate transmitted object code to the PLC and either execute arbitrary object code commands on the ASIC or on the microprocessor interpreter.\n\n- CVE-2022-34459:  Dell Command | Update, Dell Update, and Alienware Update versions prior to 4.7 contain a improper verification of cryptographic signature in get applicable driver component. A local malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to malicious payload execution. \n\n- CVE-2022-39366: DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. Prior to version 0.8.45, the `StatelessTokenService` of the DataHub metadata service (GMS) does not verify the signature of JWT tokens. This allows an attacker to connect to DataHub instances as any user if Metadata Service authentication is enabled. This vulnerability occurs because the `StatelessTokenService` of the Metadata service uses the `parse` method of `io.jsonwebtoken.JwtParser`, which does not perform a verification of the cryptographic token signature. This means that JWTs are accepted regardless of the used algorithm. This issue may lead to an authentication bypass. Version 0.8.45 contains a patch for the issue. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-41666: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists that allows adversaries with local user privileges to load a malicious DLL which could lead to execution of malicious code. Affected Products: EcoStruxure Operator Terminal Expert(V3.3 Hotfix 1 or prior), Pro-face BLUE(V3.3 Hotfix1 or prior).\n\n- CVE-2022-41669: A CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature vulnerability exists in the SGIUtility component that allows adversaries with local user privileges to load a malicious DLL which could result in execution of malicious code. Affected Products: EcoStruxure Operator Terminal Expert(V3.3 Hotfix 1 or prior), Pro-face BLUE(V3.3 Hotfix1 or prior).\n\n- CVE-2021-23993: An attacker may perform a DoS attack to prevent a user from sending encrypted email to a correspondent. If an attacker creates a crafted OpenPGP key with a subkey that has an invalid self signature, and the Thunderbird user imports the crafted key, then Thunderbird may try to use the invalid subkey, but the RNP library rejects it from being used, causing encryption to fail. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 78.9.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23540: In versions `<=8.5.1` of `jsonwebtoken` library, lack of algorithm definition in the `jwt.verify()` function can lead to signature validation bypass due to defaulting to the `none` algorithm for signature verification. Users are affected if you do not specify algorithms in the `jwt.verify()` function. This issue has been fixed, please update to version 9.0.0 which removes the default support for the none algorithm in the `jwt.verify()` method. There will be no impact, if you update to version 9.0.0 and you don\u2019t need to allow for the `none` algorithm. If you need 'none' algorithm, you have to explicitly specify that in `jwt.verify()` options. \n\n- CVE-2022-42793: An issue in code signature validation was addressed with improved checks. This issue is fixed in macOS Big Sur 11.7, macOS Ventura 13, iOS 16, iOS 15.7 and iPadOS 15.7, macOS Monterey 12.6. An app may be able to bypass code signing checks.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-345 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-345 (ChildOf)",

In CarrierWave before versions 1.3.2 and 2.1.1, there is a code injection vulnerability. The \"#manipulate!\" method inappropriately evals the content of mutation option(:read/:write), allowing attackers to craft a string that can be executed as a Ruby code. If an application developer supplies untrusted inputs to the option, it will lead to remote code execution(RCE). This is fixed in versions 1.3.2 and 2.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-27928: A remote code execution issue was discovered in MariaDB 10.2 before 10.2.37, 10.3 before 10.3.28, 10.4 before 10.4.18, and 10.5 before 10.5.9; Percona Server through 2021-03-03; and the wsrep patch through 2021-03-03 for MySQL. An untrusted search path leads to eval injection, in which a database SUPER user can execute OS commands after modifying wsrep_provider and wsrep_notify_cmd. NOTE: this does not affect an Oracle product.\n\n- CVE-2021-3725: Vulnerability in dirhistory plugin Description: the widgets that go back and forward in the directory history, triggered by pressing Alt-Left and Alt-Right, use functions that unsafely execute eval on directory names. If you cd into a directory with a carefully-crafted name, then press Alt-Left, the system is subject to command injection. Impacted areas: - Functions pop_past and pop_future in dirhistory plugin.\n\n- CVE-2021-21278: RSSHub is an open source, easy to use, and extensible RSS feed generator. In RSSHub before version 7f1c430 (non-semantic versioning) there is a risk of code injection. Some routes use `eval` or `Function constructor`, which may be injected by the target site with unsafe code, causing server-side security issues The fix in version 7f1c430 is to temporarily remove the problematic route and added a `no-new-func` rule to eslint.\n\n- CVE-2021-40084: opensysusers through 0.6 does not safely use eval on files in sysusers.d that may contain shell metacharacters. For example, it allows command execution via a crafted GECOS field whereas systemd-sysusers (a program with the same specification) does not do that.\n\n- CVE-2021-42057: Obsidian Dataview through 0.4.12-hotfix1 allows eval injection. The evalInContext function in executes user input, which allows an attacker to craft malicious Markdown files that will execute arbitrary code once opened. NOTE: 0.4.13 provides a mitigation for some use cases.\n\n- CVE-2021-32756: ManageIQ is an open-source management platform. In versions prior to jansa-4, kasparov-2, and lasker-1, there is a flaw in the MiqExpression module of ManageIQ where a low privilege user could enter a crafted Ruby string which would be evaluated. Successful exploitation will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the host system. There are patches for this issue in releases named jansa-4, kasparov-2, and lasker-1. If possible, restrict users, via RBAC, to only the part of the application that they need access to. While MiqExpression is widely used throughout the product, restricting users can limit the surface of the attack.\n\n- CVE-2020-22201: phpCMS 2008 sp4 allowas remote malicious users to execute arbitrary php commands via the pagesize parameter to yp/product.php.\n\n- CVE-2021-23344: The package total.js before 3.4.8 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via set.\n\n- CVE-2021-32924: Invision Community (aka IPS Community Suite) before 4.6.0 allows eval-based PHP code injection by a moderator because the IPS\\\\cms\\\\modules\\\\front\\\\pages\\\\_builder::previewBlock method interacts unsafely with the IPS\\\\_Theme::runProcessFunction method.\n\n- CVE-2021-41228: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions TensorFlow's `saved_model_cli` tool is vulnerable to a code injection as it calls `eval` on user supplied strings. This can be used by attackers to run arbitrary code on the plaform where the CLI tool runs. However, given that the tool is always run manually, the impact of this is not severe. We have patched this by adding a `safe` flag which defaults to `True` and an explicit warning for users. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-43281: MyBB before 1.8.29 allows Remote Code Injection by an admin with the \"Can manage settings?\" permission. The Admin CP's Settings management module does not validate setting types correctly on insertion and update, making it possible to add settings of supported type \"php\" with PHP code, executed on Change Settings pages.\n\n- CVE-2020-15591: fexsrv in F*EX (aka Frams' Fast File EXchange) before fex-20160919_2 allows eval injection (for unauthenticated remote code execution).\n\n- CVE-2021-43269: In Code42 app before 8.8.0, eval injection allows an attacker to change a device\u2019s proxy configuration to use a malicious proxy auto-config (PAC) file, leading to arbitrary code execution. This affects Incydr Basic, Advanced, and Gov F1; CrashPlan Cloud; and CrashPlan for Small Business. (Incydr Professional and Enterprise are unaffected.)\n\n- CVE-2021-23277: Eaton Intelligent Power Manager (IPM) prior to 1.69 is vulnerable to unauthenticated eval injection vulnerability. The software does not neutralize code syntax from users before using in the dynamic evaluation call in loadUserFile function under scripts/libs/utils.js. Successful exploitation can allow attackers to control the input to the function and execute attacker controlled commands.\n\n- CVE-2022-40871: Dolibarr ERP & CRM <=15.0.3 is vulnerable to Eval injection. By default, any administrator can be added to the installation page of dolibarr, and if successfully added, malicious code can be inserted into the database and then execute it by eval.\n\n- CVE-2021-22204: Improper neutralization of user data in the DjVu file format in ExifTool versions 7.44 and up allows arbitrary code execution when parsing the malicious image\n\n- CVE-2022-0845: Code Injection in GitHub repository pytorchlightning/pytorch-lightning prior to 1.6.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-29216: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, TensorFlow's `saved_model_cli` tool is vulnerable to a code injection. This can be used to open a reverse shell. This code path was maintained for compatibility reasons as the maintainers had several test cases where numpy expressions were used as arguments. However, given that the tool is always run manually, the impact of this is still not severe. The maintainers have now removed the `safe=False` argument, so all parsing is done without calling `eval`. The patch is available in versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4.\n\n- CVE-2022-32417: PbootCMS v3.1.2 was discovered to contain a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability via the function parserIfLabel at function.php.\n\n- CVE-2022-3394: The WP All Export Pro WordPress plugin before 1.7.9 does not limit some functionality during exports only to users with the Administrator role, allowing any logged in user which has been given privileges to perform exports to execute arbitrary code on the site. By default only administrators can run exports, but the privilege can be delegated to lower privileged users.\n\n- CVE-2022-38193: There is a code injection vulnerability in Esri Portal for ArcGIS versions 10.8.1 and below that may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to pass strings which could potentially cause arbitrary code execution.\n\n- CVE-2022-46648: ruby-git versions prior to v1.13.0 allows a remote authenticated attacker to execute an arbitrary ruby code by having a user to load a repository containing a specially crafted filename to the product.

When configured to use a specific server for a given network interface, dnsmasq uses a fixed port while forwarding queries. An attacker on the network, able to find the outgoing port used by dnsmasq, only needs to guess the random transmission ID to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This flaw makes a DNS Cache Poisoning attack much easier. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-23020: The NAAS 3.x before 3.10.0 API keys were generated using an insecure pseudo-random string and hashing algorithm which could lead to predictable keys.\n\n- CVE-2021-41829: Zoho ManageEngine Remote Access Plus before 10.1.2121.1 relies on the application's build number to calculate a certain encryption key.\n\n- CVE-2021-31520: A weak session token authentication bypass vulnerability in Trend Micro IM Security 1.6 and 1.6.5 could allow an remote attacker to guess currently logged-in administrators' session session token in order to gain access to the product's web management interface.\n\n- CVE-2021-0466: In startIpClient of ClientModeImpl.java, there is a possible identifier which could be used to track a device. This could lead to remote information disclosure to a proximal attacker, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10Android ID: A-154114734\n\n- CVE-2021-24998: The Simple JWT Login WordPress plugin before 3.3.0 can be used to create new WordPress user accounts with a randomly generated password. The password is generated using the str_shuffle PHP function that \"does not generate cryptographically secure values, and should not be used for cryptographic purposes\" according to PHP's documentation.\n\n- CVE-2021-28099: In Netflix OSS Hollow, since the Files.exists(parent) is run before creating the directories, an attacker can pre-create these directories with wide permissions. Additionally, since an insecure source of randomness is used, the file names to be created can be deterministically calculated.\n\n- CVE-2022-22922: TP-Link TL-WA850RE Wi-Fi Range Extender before v6_200923 was discovered to use highly predictable and easily detectable session keys, allowing attackers to gain administrative privileges.\n\n- CVE-2022-23138: ZTE's MF297D product has cryptographic issues vulnerability. Due to the use of weak random values, the security of the device is reduced, and it may face the risk of attack.\n\n- CVE-2022-24406: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 allows SSRF because multipart/form-data boundaries are predictable, and this can lead to injection into internal Documentconverter API calls.\n\n- CVE-2022-30295: uClibc-ng through 1.0.40 and uClibc through 0.9.33.2 use predictable DNS transaction IDs that may lead to DNS cache poisoning. This is related to a reset of a value to 0x2.\n\n- CVE-2022-31157: LTI 1.3 Tool Library is a library used for building IMS-certified LTI 1.3 tool providers in PHP. Prior to version 5.0, the function used to generate random nonces was not sufficiently cryptographically complex. Users should upgrade to version 5.0 to receive a patch. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-32296: The Linux kernel before 5.17.9 allows TCP servers to identify clients by observing what source ports are used. This occurs because of use of Algorithm 4 (\"Double-Hash Port Selection Algorithm\") of RFC 6056.\n\n- CVE-2022-40299: In Singular before 4.3.1, a predictable /tmp pathname is used (e.g., by sdb.cc), which allows local users to gain the privileges of other users via a procedure in a file under /tmp. NOTE: this CVE Record is about sdb.cc and similar files in the Singular interface that have predictable /tmp pathnames; this CVE Record is not about the lack of a safe temporary-file creation capability in the Singular language.\n\n- CVE-2021-26726: A remote code execution vulnerability affecting a Valmet DNA service listening on TCP port 1517, allows an attacker to execute commands with SYSTEM privileges This issue affects: Valmet DNA versions from Collection 2012 until Collection 2021.\n\n- CVE-2021-45487: In NetBSD through 9.2, the IPv4 ID generation algorithm does not use appropriate cryptographic measures.\n\n- CVE-2021-45488: In NetBSD through 9.2, there is an information leak in the TCP ISN (ISS) generation algorithm.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-693 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-804 (CanPrecede)",

During viewing of a malicious request, it can be manipulated into issuing a request that does not respect its upstream proxy configuration. This could leak NetNTLM hashes on Windows systems that fail to block outbound SMB.\n\n- CVE-2021-30127: TerraMaster F2-210 devices through 2021-04-03 use UPnP to make the admin web server accessible over the Internet on TCP port 8181, which is arguably inconsistent with the \"It is only available on the local network\" documentation. NOTE: manually editing /etc/upnp.json provides a partial but undocumented workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31810: An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.6.7, 2.7.x through 2.7.3, and 3.x through 3.0.1. A malicious FTP server can use the PASV response to trick Net::FTP into connecting back to a given IP address and port. This potentially makes curl extract information about services that are otherwise private and not disclosed (e.g., the attacker can conduct port scans and service banner extractions).\n\n- CVE-2021-20999: In Weidm\u00fcller u-controls and IoT-Gateways in versions up to 1.12.1 a network port intended only for device-internal usage is accidentally accessible via external network interfaces. By exploiting this vulnerability the device may be manipulated or the operation may be stopped.\n\n- CVE-2021-21210: Inappropriate implementation in Network in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.72 allowed a remote attacker to potentially access local UDP ports via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-42343: An issue was discovered in the Dask distributed package before 2021.10.0 for Python. Single machine Dask clusters started with dask.distributed.LocalCluster or dask.distributed.Client (which defaults to using LocalCluster) would mistakenly configure their respective Dask workers to listen on external interfaces (typically with a randomly selected high port) rather than only on localhost. A Dask cluster created using this method (when running on a machine that has an applicable port exposed) could be used by a sophisticated attacker to achieve remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2021-22916: In Brave Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.26.60, when adblocking is enabled and a proxy browser extension is installed, the CNAME adblocking feature issues DNS requests that used the system DNS settings instead of the extension's proxy settings, resulting in possible information disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2021-22917: Brave Browser Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.20 is vulnerable to information disclosure by way of DNS requests in Tor windows not flowing through Tor if adblocking was enabled.\n\n- CVE-2020-4062: In Conjur OSS Helm Chart before 2.0.0, a recently identified critical vulnerability resulted in the installation of the Conjur Postgres database with an open port. This allows an attacker to gain full read & write access to the Conjur Postgres database, including escalating the attacker's privileges to assume full control. A malicious actor who knows the IP address and port number of the Postgres database and has access into the Kubernetes cluster where Conjur runs can gain full read & write access to the Postgres database. This enables the attacker to write a policy that allows full access to retrieve any secret. This Helm chart is a method to install Conjur OSS into a Kubernetes environment. Hence, the systems impacted are only Conjur OSS systems that were deployed using this chart. Other deployments including Docker and the CyberArk Dynamic Access Provider (DAP) are not affected. To remediate this vulnerability, clone the latest Helm Chart and follow the upgrade instructions. If you are not able to fully remediate this vulnerability immediately, you can mitigate some of the risk by making sure Conjur OSS is deployed on an isolated Kubernetes cluster or namespace. The term \"isolated\" refers to: - No other workloads besides Conjur OSS and its backend database are running in that Kubernetes cluster/namespace. - Kubernetes and helm access to the cluster/namespace is limited to security administrators via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).\n\n- CVE-2020-10087: GitLab before 12.8.2 allows Information Disclosure. Badge images were not being proxied, causing mixed content warnings as well as leaking the IP address of the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-32690: Helm is a tool for managing Charts (packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources). In versions of helm prior to 3.6.1, a vulnerability exists where the username and password credentials associated with a Helm repository could be passed on to another domain referenced by that Helm repository. This issue has been resolved in 3.6.1. There is a workaround through which one may check for improperly passed credentials. One may use a username and password for a Helm repository and may audit the Helm repository in order to check for another domain being used that could have received the credentials. In the `index.yaml` file for that repository, one may look for another domain in the `urls` list for the chart versions. If there is another domain found and that chart version was pulled or installed, the credentials would be passed on.\n\n- CVE-2021-32707: Nextcloud Mail is a mail app for Nextcloud. In versions prior to 1.9.6, the Nextcloud Mail application does not, by default, render images in emails to not leak the read state. The privacy filter failed to filter images with a `background-image` CSS attribute. Note that the images were still passed through the Nextcloud image proxy, and thus there was no IP leakage. The issue was patched in version 1.9.6 and 1.10.0. No workarounds are known to exist.\n\n- CVE-2020-14312: A flaw was found in the default configuration of dnsmasq, as shipped with Fedora versions prior to 31 and in all versions Red Hat Enterprise Linux, where it listens on any interface and accepts queries from addresses outside of its local subnet. In particular, the option `local-service` is not enabled. Running dnsmasq in this manner may inadvertently make it an open resolver accessible from any address on the internet. This flaw allows an attacker to conduct a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against other systems.\n\n- CVE-2021-20149: Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 does not have sufficient access controls for the WAN interface. The default iptables ruleset for governing access to services on the device only apply to IPv4. All services running on the devices are accessible via the WAN interface via IPv6 by default.\n\n- CVE-2020-1938: When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations.\n\n- CVE-2022-22547: Simple Diagnostics Agent - versions 1.0 (up to version 1.57.), allows an attacker to access information which would otherwise be restricted via a random port 9000-65535. This allows information gathering which could be used exploit future open-source security exploits.\n\n- CVE-2022-44784: An issue was discovered in Appalti & Contratti 9.12.2. The target web applications LFS and DL229 expose a set of services provided by the Axis 1.4 instance, embedded directly into the applications, as hinted by the WEB-INF/web.xml file leaked through Local File Inclusion. Among the exposed services, there is the Axis AdminService, which, through the default configuration, should normally be accessible only by the localhost. Nevertheless, by trying to access the mentioned service, both in LFS and DL229, the service can actually be reached even by remote users, allowing creation of arbitrary services on the server side. When an attacker can reach the AdminService, they can use it to instantiate arbitrary services on the server. The exploit procedure is well known and described in Generic AXIS-SSRF exploitation. Basically, the attack consists of writing a JSP page inside the root directory of the web application, through the org.apache.axis.handlers.LogHandler class.\n\n- CVE-2022-26834: Improper access control vulnerability in Rakuten Casa version AP_F_V1_4_1 or AP_F_V2_0_0 allows a remote attacker to obtain the information stored in the product because the product is set to accept HTTP connections from the WAN side by default.\n\n- CVE-2022-4390: A network misconfiguration is present in versions prior to 1.0.9.90 of the NETGEAR RAX30 AX2400 series of routers. IPv6 is enabled for the WAN interface by default on these devices. While there are firewall restrictions in place that define access restrictions for IPv4 traffic, these restrictions do not appear to be applied to the WAN interface for IPv6. This allows arbitrary access to any services running on the device that may be inadvertently listening via IPv6, such as the SSH and Telnet servers spawned on ports 22 and 23 by default. This misconfiguration could allow an attacker to interact with services only intended to be accessible by clients on the local network.\n\n- CVE-2022-45414: If a Thunderbird user quoted from an HTML email, for example by replying to the email, and the email contained either a VIDEO tag with the POSTER attribute or an OBJECT tag with a DATA attribute, a network request to the referenced remote URL was performed, regardless of a configuration to block remote content. An image loaded from the POSTER attribute was shown in the composer window. These issues could have given an attacker additional capabilities when targetting releases that did not yet have a fix for CVE-2022-3033 which was reported around three months ago. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.5.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-47717: Last Yard 22.09.8-1 is vulnerable to Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).\n\n- CVE-2022-3057: Inappropriate implementation in iframe Sandbox in Google Chrome prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-31055: kCTF is a Kubernetes-based infrastructure for capture the flag (CTF) competitions. Prior to version 1.6.0, the kctf cluster set-src-ip-ranges was broken and allowed traffic from any IP. The problem has been patched in v1.6.0. As a workaround, those who want to test challenges privately can mark them as `public: false` and use `kctf chal debug port-forward` to connect.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",

NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-11736.\n\n- CVE-2021-21272: ORAS is open source software which enables a way to push OCI Artifacts to OCI Conformant registries. ORAS is both a CLI for initial testing and a Go Module. In ORAS from version 0.4.0 and before version 0.9.0, there is a \"zip-slip\" vulnerability. The directory support feature allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links and hard links. A well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who runs `oras pull`. Users of the affected versions are impacted if they are `oras` CLI users who runs `oras pull`, or if they are Go programs, which invoke `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`. The problem has been fixed in version 0.9.0. For `oras` CLI users, there is no workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider. For `oras` package users, the workaround is to not use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`, and use other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider.\n\n- CVE-2021-28650: autoar-extractor.c in GNOME gnome-autoar before 0.3.1, as used by GNOME Shell, Nautilus, and other software, allows Directory Traversal during extraction because it lacks a check of whether a file's parent is a symlink in certain complex situations. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-36241.\n\n- CVE-2021-32518: A vulnerability in share_link in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote attackers to create a symbolic link then access arbitrary files. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32803: The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.4.15, and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via insufficient symlink protection. `node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-32825: bblfshd is an open source self-hosted server for source code parsing. In bblfshd before commit 4265465b9b6fb5663c30ee43806126012066aad4 there is a \"zipslip\" vulnerability. The unsafe handling of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may enable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations outside the designated target folder. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive file. Additionally, if the attacker has read access to the unpacked files, he may be able to read arbitrary system files the parent process has permissions to read. For more details including a PoC see the referenced GHSL-2020-258.\n\n- CVE-2021-36286: Dell SupportAssist Client Consumer versions 3.9.13.0 and any versions prior to 3.9.13.0 contain an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability that can be exploited by using the Windows feature of NTFS called Symbolic links. Symbolic links can be created by any(non-privileged) user under some object directories, but by themselves are not sufficient to successfully escalate privileges. However, combining them with a different object, such as the NTFS junction point allows for the exploitation. Support assist clean files functionality do not distinguish junction points from the physical folder and proceeds to clean the target of the junction that allows nonprivileged users to create junction points and delete arbitrary files on the system which can be accessed only by the admin.\n\n- CVE-2021-38511: An issue was discovered in the tar crate before 0.4.36 for Rust. When symlinks are present in a TAR archive, extraction can create arbitrary directories via .. traversal.\n\n- CVE-2021-29136: Open Container Initiative umoci before 0.4.7 allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary host paths via a crafted image that causes symlink traversal when \"umoci unpack\" or \"umoci raw unpack\" is used.\n\n- CVE-2020-27833: A Zip Slip vulnerability was found in the oc binary in openshift-clients where an arbitrary file write is achieved by using a specially crafted raw container image (.tar file) which contains symbolic links. The vulnerability is limited to the command `oc image extract`. If a symbolic link is first created pointing within the tarball, this allows further symbolic links to bypass the existing path check. This flaw allows the tarball to create links outside the tarball's parent directory, allowing for executables or configuration files to be overwritten, resulting in arbitrary code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. Versions up to and including openshift-clients-4.7.0-202104250659.p0.git.95881af are affected.\n\n- CVE-2020-27697: Trend Micro Security 2020 (Consumer) contains a vulnerability in the installer package that could be exploited by placing a malicious DLL in a non-protected location with high privileges (symlink attack) which can lead to obtaining administrative privileges during the installation of the product.\n\n- CVE-2020-4717: A vulnerability exists in IBM SPSS Modeler Subscription Installer that allows a user with create symbolic link permission to write arbitrary file in another protected path during product installation. IBM X-Force ID: 187727.\n\n- CVE-2021-23239: The sudoedit personality of Sudo before 1.9.5 may allow a local unprivileged user to perform arbitrary directory-existence tests by winning a sudo_edit.c race condition in replacing a user-controlled directory by a symlink to an arbitrary path.\n\n- CVE-2021-32508: Absolute Path Traversal vulnerability in FileStreaming in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote authenticated attackers access arbitrary files by injecting the Symbolic Link following the Url path parameter. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32509: Absolute Path Traversal vulnerability in FileviewDoc in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote authenticated attackers access arbitrary files by injecting the Symbolic Link following the Url path parameter.

It affects multi-user setups in which \u2019guix-daemon\u2019 runs locally. The attack consists in having an unprivileged user spawn a build process, for instance with `guix build`, that makes its build directory world-writable. The user then creates a hardlink to a root-owned file such as /etc/shadow in that build directory. If the user passed the --keep-failed option and the build eventually fails, the daemon changes ownership of the whole build tree, including the hardlink, to the user. At that point, the user has write access to the target file. Versions after and including v0.11.0-3298-g2608e40988, and versions prior to v1.2.0-75109-g94f0312546 are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2020-28007: Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Execution with Unnecessary Privileges. Because Exim operates as root in the log directory (owned by a non-root user), a symlink or hard link attack allows overwriting critical root-owned files anywhere on the filesystem.\n\n- CVE-2021-22488: There is an Unauthorized file access vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability by modifying soft links may tamper with the files restored from backups.\n\n- CVE-2021-23872: Privilege Escalation vulnerability in the File Lock component of McAfee Total Protection (MTP) prior to 16.0.32 allows a local user to gain elevated privileges by manipulating a symbolic link in the IOCTL interface.\n\n- CVE-2021-23873: Privilege Escalation vulnerability in McAfee Total Protection (MTP) prior to 16.0.30 allows a local user to gain elevated privileges and perform arbitrary file deletion as the SYSTEM user potentially causing Denial of Service via manipulating Junction link, after enumerating certain files, at a specific time.\n\n- CVE-2021-34408: The Zoom Client for Meetings for Windows in all versions before version 5.3.2 writes log files to a user writable directory as a privileged user during the installation or update of the client. This could allow for potential privilege escalation if a link was created between the user writable directory used and a non-user writable directory.\n\n- CVE-2021-36744: Trend Micro Security (Consumer) 2021 and 2020 are vulnerable to a directory junction vulnerability which could allow an attacker to exploit the system to escalate privileges and create a denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2021-37969: Inappropriate implementation in Google Updater in Google Chrome on Windows prior to 94.0.4606.54 allowed a remote attacker to perform local privilege escalation via a crafted file.\n\n- CVE-2021-44038: An issue was discovered in Quagga through 1.2.4. Unsafe chown/chmod operations in the suggested spec file allow users (with control of the non-root-owned directory /etc/quagga) to escalate their privileges to root upon package installation or update.\n\n- CVE-2021-31843: Improper privileges management vulnerability in McAfee Endpoint Security (ENS) Windows prior to 10.7.0 September 2021 Update allows local users to access files which they would otherwise not have access to via manipulating junction links to redirect McAfee folder operations to an unintended location. \n\n- CVE-2020-7346: Privilege Escalation vulnerability in McAfee Data Loss Prevention (DLP) for Windows prior to 11.6.100 allows a local, low privileged, attacker through the use of junctions to cause the product to load DLLs of the attacker's choosing. This requires the creation and removal of junctions by the attacker along with sending a specific IOTL command at the correct time. \n\n- CVE-2021-45231: A link following privilege escalation vulnerability in Trend Micro Apex One (on-prem and SaaS) and Trend Micro Worry-Free Business Security (10.0 SP1 and Services) could allow a local attacker to create a specially crafted file with arbitrary content which could grant local privilege escalation on the affected system. Please note: an attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-43237: Windows Setup Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-43238: Windows Remote Access Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-41551: Leostream Connection Broker 9.0.40.17 allows administrators to conduct directory traversal attacks by uploading z ZIP file that contains a symbolic link.\n\n- CVE-2020-0787: An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) improperly handles symbolic links, aka 'Windows Background Intelligent Transfer Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability'.\n\n- CVE-2021-4287: A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in ReFirm Labs binwalk up to 2.3.2.

Since the file is visible, the application that is using the temporary file could be known. If one has access to list the processes on the system, the attacker has gained information about what the user is doing at that time. By correlating this with the applications the user is running, an attacker could potentially discover what a user's actions are. From this, higher levels of security could be breached.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-27818: A hotkey daemon written in Rust creates a domain socket file underneath /tmp, which is accessible by any user.\n\n- CVE-2021-21290: A Java-based application for a rapid-development framework uses File.createTempFile() to create a random temporary file with insecure default permissions.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-28568: Adobe Genuine Services version 7.1 (and earlier) is affected by an Insecure file permission vulnerability during installation process.

An unauthenticated attacker could leverage this vulnerability to call functions against the installer to perform high privileged actions. Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-28623: Adobe Premiere Elements version 5.2 (and earlier) is affected by an insecure temporary file creation vulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker could leverage this vulnerability to call functions against the installer to perform high privileged actions. Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-28168: Eclipse Jersey 2.28 to 2.33 and Eclipse Jersey 3.0.0 to 3.0.1 contains a local information disclosure vulnerability. This is due to the use of the File.createTempFile which creates a file inside of the system temporary directory with the permissions: -rw-r--r--. Thus the contents of this file are viewable by all other users locally on the system. As such, if the contents written is security sensitive, it can be disclosed to other local users.\n\n- CVE-2021-36002: Adobe Captivate version 11.5.5 (and earlier) is affected by an Creation of Temporary File In Directory With Incorrect Permissions vulnerability that could result in privilege escalation in the context of the current user.

An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to cause arbitrary file overwriting in the context of the current user. Exploitation of this issue requires physical interaction to the system.\n\n- CVE-2021-21428: Openapi generator is a java tool which allows generation of API client libraries (SDK generation), server stubs, documentation and configuration automatically given an OpenAPI Spec. openapi-generator-online creates insecure temporary folders with File.createTempFile during the code generation process. The insecure temporary folders store the auto-generated files which can be read and appended to by any users on the system. The issue has been patched with `Files.createTempFile` and released in the v5.1.0 stable version.\n\n- CVE-2022-27818: SWHKD 1.1.5 unsafely uses the /tmp/swhkd.sock pathname. There can be an information leak or denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2022-23950: In Keylime before 6.3.0, Revocation Notifier uses a fixed /tmp path for UNIX domain socket which can allow unprivileged users a method to prohibit keylime operations.\n\n- CVE-2022-23163: Dell PowerScale OneFS, 8.2,x, 9.1.0.x, 9.2.1.x, and 9.3.0.x contain a denial of service vulnerability. A local malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to denial of service/data unavailability.\n\n- CVE-2022-26850: When creating or updating credentials for single-user access, Apache NiFi wrote a copy of the Login Identity Providers configuration to the operating system temporary directory. On most platforms, the operating system temporary directory has global read permissions. NiFi immediately moved the temporary file to the final configuration directory, which significantly limited the window of opportunity for access. NiFi 1.16.0 includes updates to replace the Login Identity Providers configuration without writing a file to the operating system temporary directory.\n\n- CVE-2022-28226: Local privilege vulnerability in Yandex Browser for Windows prior to 22.3.3.801 allows a local, low privileged, attacker to execute arbitary code with the SYSTEM privileges through manipulating temporary files in directory with insecure permissions during Yandex Browser update process.\n\n- CVE-2022-41946: pgjdbc is an open source postgresql JDBC Driver. In affected versions a prepared statement using either `PreparedStatement.setText(int, InputStream)` or `PreparedStatemet.setBytea(int, InputStream)` will create a temporary file if the InputStream is larger than 2k. This will create a temporary file which is readable by other users on Unix like systems, but not MacOS. On Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. Because of this, when files and directories are written into this directory they are, by default, readable by other users on that same system. This vulnerability does not allow other users to overwrite the contents of these directories or files. This is purely an information disclosure vulnerability. Because certain JDK file system APIs were only added in JDK 1.7, this this fix is dependent upon the version of the JDK you are using. Java 1.7 and higher users: this vulnerability is fixed in 4.5.0. Java 1.6 and lower users: no patch is available. If you are unable to patch, or are stuck running on Java 1.6, specifying the java.io.tmpdir system environment variable to a directory that is exclusively owned by the executing user will mitigate this vulnerability.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-377 (ChildOf)",

          "extended_description": "\n\nCryptographic protocols and systems depend on cryptographic primitives (and associated algorithms) as their basic building blocks. Some common examples of primitives are digital signatures, one-way hash functions, ciphers, and public key cryptography; however, the notion of \"primitive\" can vary depending on point of view. See \"Terminology Notes\" for further explanation of some concepts.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives are defined to accomplish one very specific task in a precisely defined and mathematically reliable fashion. For example, suppose that for a specific cryptographic primitive (such as an encryption routine), the consensus is that the primitive can only be broken after trying out N different inputs (where the larger the value of N, the stronger the cryptography). For an encryption scheme like AES-256, one would expect N to be so large as to be infeasible to execute in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n\nIf a vulnerability is ever found that shows that one can break a cryptographic primitive in significantly less than the expected number of attempts, then that primitive is considered weakened (or sometimes in extreme cases, colloquially it is \"broken\"). As a result, anything using this cryptographic primitive would now be considered insecure or risky. Thus, even breaking or weakening a seemingly small cryptographic primitive has the potential to render the whole system vulnerable, due to its reliance on the primitive. A historical example can be found in TLS when using DES. One would colloquially call DES the cryptographic primitive for transport encryption in this version of TLS. In the past, DES was considered strong, because no weaknesses were found in it; importantly, DES has a key length of 56 bits. Trying N=2^56 keys was considered impractical for most actors. Unfortunately, attacking a system with 56-bit keys is now practical via brute force, which makes defeating DES encryption practical. It is now practical for an adversary to read any information sent under this version of TLS and use this information to attack the system. As a result, it can be claimed that this use of TLS is weak, and that any system depending on TLS with DES could potentially render the entire system vulnerable to attack.\n\n\nCryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are only considered safe after extensive research and review from experienced cryptographers from academia, industry, and government entities looking for any possible flaws. Furthermore, cryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are frequently reevaluated for safety when new mathematical and attack techniques are discovered. As a result and over time, even well-known cryptographic primitives can lose their compliance status with the discovery of novel attacks that might either defeat the algorithm or reduce its robustness significantly.\n\n\nIf ad-hoc cryptographic primitives are implemented, it is almost certain that the implementation will be vulnerable to attacks that are well understood by cryptographers, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information and other consequences.\n\n\nThis weakness is even more difficult to manage for hardware-implemented deployment of cryptographic algorithms. First, because hardware is not patchable as easily as software, any flaw discovered after release and production typically cannot be fixed without a recall of the product. Secondly, the hardware product is often expected to work for years, during which time computation power available to the attacker only increases. Therefore, for hardware implementations of cryptographic primitives, it is absolutely essential that only strong, proven cryptographic primitives are used.\n",

They rely on cryptographically secure and unique seeds for entropy so proper seeding is critical to the secure operation of the PRNG.\n\n\n Management of seeds could be broken down into two main areas: \n\n\n  -  (1) protecting seeds as cryptographic material (such as a cryptographic key); \n\n  -  (2) whenever possible, using a uniquely generated seed from a cryptographically secure source \n\n PRNGs require a seed as input to generate a stream of numbers that are functionally indistinguishable from random numbers. While the output is, in many cases, sufficient for cryptographic uses, the output of any PRNG is directly determined by the seed provided as input. If the seed can be ascertained by a third party, the entire output of the PRNG can be made known to them. As such, the seed should be kept secret and should ideally not be able to be guessed. For example, the current time may be a poor seed. Knowing the approximate time the PRNG was seeded greatly reduces the possible key space. \n\n Seeds do not necessarily need to be unique, but reusing seeds may open up attacks if the seed is discovered. \n",

Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.\n\n\nIt is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.\n\n\nSince the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered \"unsafe\" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.\n\n\nFor a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.\n",
