## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
### Root cause of vulnerability
The `hfe_template` shortcode in the Elementor Header & Footer Builder plugin does not properly check user permissions when rendering content.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- **Information Disclosure:** The plugin fails to verify if the user has the necessary permissions to view the content associated with the template ID passed to the `hfe_template` shortcode.
- **Insecure Shortcode Handling:** The shortcode directly retrieves and displays content without proper authorization checks.

### Impact of exploitation
- An attacker with Contributor-level access or higher can use the `hfe_template` shortcode to view the content of draft, private, and password-protected posts that they do not own.

### Attack vectors
- An authenticated user with Contributor or higher level access can insert the `hfe_template` shortcode into a page or post, specifying the ID of a target post (header/footer) they don't have permissions to view.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- The attacker needs to have an account with Contributor-level access or higher on the WordPress site.
