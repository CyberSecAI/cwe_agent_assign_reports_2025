# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-48925

# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-48925
## Query
The TeleMessage service through 2025-05-05 relies on the client side (e.g., the TM SGNL app) to do MD5 hashing, and then accepts the hash as the authentication credential, as exploited in the wild in May 2025.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'weak client side MD5 hashing'
