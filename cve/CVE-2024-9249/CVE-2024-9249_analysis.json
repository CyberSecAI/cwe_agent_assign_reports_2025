This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Foxit PDF Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PDF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24301.",

The root cause is the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-20). CWE-20 is a class-level CWE and is a parent of CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) and CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound). CWE-125 can be caused by a number of different weaknesses including CWE-129 (Improper Validation of Array Index), CWE-822 (Untrusted Pointer Dereference), CWE-823 (Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset), and CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    \n    cwe1284 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe190 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe125 -->|CAUSED_BY| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n    class cwe1284,cwe190 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-20).
