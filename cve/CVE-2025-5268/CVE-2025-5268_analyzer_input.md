# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-5268

## Vulnerability Description
Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 138, Thunderbird 138, Firefox ESR 128.10, and Thunderbird 128.10. Some of these bugs showed evidence of **memory corruption** and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 139, Firefox ESR < 128.11, Thunderbird < 139, and Thunderbird < 128.11.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **memory safety bugs**
- **weakness:** **memory corruption**
- **product:** Firefox, Thunderbird, Firefox ESR
- **impact:** arbitrary code execution, run arbitrary code
- **version:** < 139, < 139, < 128.11
