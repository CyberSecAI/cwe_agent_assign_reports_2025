CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (**Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**), which is a Class level CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **memory corruption** while parsing specially crafted WRL files, pointing to an out-of-bounds write condition as the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the parsing of a specially crafted WRL file, leading to **memory corruption** due to an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787). This can then lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the vulnerability is primarily caused by an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787) during the parsing of specially crafted WRL files. The evidence is strong, as the vulnerability description explicitly mentions **memory corruption**, and the CVE reference links confirm this with \"The vulnerability is due to memory corruption while parsing specially crafted WRL files.\" The **memory corruption** allows an attacker to execute code. The retriever results also listed CWE-787 as the top candidate.

CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (**Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**), which is a Class level CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **memory corruption** while parsing specially crafted WRL files, pointing to an out-of-bounds write condition as the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the parsing of a specially crafted WRL file, leading to **memory corruption** due to an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787). This can then lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the vulnerability is primarily caused by an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787) during the parsing of specially crafted WRL files. The evidence is strong, as the vulnerability description explicitly mentions **memory corruption**, and the CVE reference links confirm this with \"The vulnerability is due to memory corruption while parsing specially crafted WRL files.\" The **memory corruption** allows an attacker to execute code.
