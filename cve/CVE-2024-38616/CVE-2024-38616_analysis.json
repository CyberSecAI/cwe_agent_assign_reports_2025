  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi carl9170 re-fix fortified-memset warning The carl9170_tx_release() function sometimes triggers a fortified-memset warning in my randconfig builds In file included from include/linux/string.h254, from drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/tx.c40 In function fortify_memset_chk, inlined from carl9170_tx_release at drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/tx.c2832, inlined from kref_put at include/linux/kref.h653, inlined from carl9170_tx_put_skb at drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/tx.c3429 include/linux/fortify-string.h49325 error call to __write_overflow_field declared with attribute warning detected **write beyond size of field** (1st parameter) maybe use struct_group()? [-Werror=attribute-warning] 493 | __write_overflow_field(p_size_field, size) Kees previously tried to avoid this by using memset_after(), but it seems this does not fully address the problem. I noticed that the memset_after() here is done on a different part of the union (status) than the original cast was from (rate_driver_data), which may confuse the compiler. Unfortunately, the memset_after() trick does not work on driver_rates[] because that is part of an anonymous struct, and I could not get struct_group() to do this either. Using two separate memset() calls on the two members does address the warning though.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content describes a fix for a fortified-memset warning in the `carl9170_tx_release()` function within the Linux kernel's wifi driver for the carl9170. This is not a vulnerability, but a compiler warning which can be an indicator of potential issues.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe `carl9170_tx_release()` function was using `memset_after()` to clear a portion of the `txinfo` structure. However, the `memset_after()` was operating on the `status` member of a union, while the intended target was related to `rate_driver_data`.  This mismatch, along with the use of anonymous structs, triggered a `fortified-memset` compiler warning, indicating a potential buffer overflow issue.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n-  The primary issue is not a vulnerability but a compiler warning (-Werror=attribute-warning) which is raised by the `fortify_memset_chk` function. The warning indicates a potential write beyond the intended size, which could lead to memory corruption under certain circumstances. \n- Using `memset_after` on a different part of a union than intended, and confusion with anonymous structs.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n-  The described scenario is not an exploitable vulnerability but can lead to undefined behavior if the compiler warning was indicative of a real memory corruption. \n-  In the case, it was a false alarm (as in, not exploitable memory corruption), and the fix is to prevent the compiler warning.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n-  There is no known attack vector for a malicious actor to exploit this issue. The issue is not an exploitable vulnerability but rather a compiler warning being generated due to incorrect usage of memory clearing functions.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- Not applicable since it's not an exploitable vulnerability.\n\n**More Details than CVE:**\nThe provided commit logs and code diffs offer far greater detail than a typical CVE description would, explaining the precise cause of the compiler warning, the failed attempts to address it, and the final solution. It details how `memset_after()` was used incorrectly and why it triggered the warning and provides the corrected code changes using two memset calls on the right fields within the struct.",

The **improper use of memset_after() function** resulted in a potential **write beyond size of field**, indicating a calculation issue related to the buffer size. |\n| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The `memset_after()` function expects a size argument, and the warning suggests this wasn't correctly validated in the context of the union members, potentially leading to a write beyond the intended boundary. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship considered here is the chain of events leading to the compiler warning. The **incorrect calculation of buffer size** (CWE-131) can lead to **improper validation of specified quantity in input** (CWE-1284) when functions like `memset_after()` are used. While neither are direct parents/children, they represent a sequence of potential flaws. CWE-131 is the root cause, leading to the warning.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe131[\"CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    \n    cwe131 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe1284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe131 primary\n    class cwe1284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  The developer intends to clear memory using `memset_after()`.\n2.  There is an **improper use of memset_after() function** on the `status` member of a union instead of the intended `rate_driver_data` member.\n3.  This leads to a mismatch in the intended memory region, potentially causing a write beyond the expected boundary, which results in the **write beyond size of field** warning.\n4.  The compiler's `fortify_memset_chk` function detects this potential out-of-bounds write.\n5.  The root cause is CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size), as the size was not correctly handled during the memory clearing operation.\n6.  CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) arises since `memset_after()`'s size argument wasn't validated against the union members, potentially writing beyond the intended boundary.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause behind the compiler warning. The evidence, \"**write beyond size of field**,\" points towards a potential buffer overflow scenario stemming from incorrect memory handling.\n\nThe retriever results suggested several CWEs related to uninitialized variables and resource management. However, these didn't directly address the explicit \"*write beyond size of field*\" error. While resource initialization issues might be present, they aren't the primary driver behind the warning.\n\nCWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size) emerged as a strong candidate due to the `memset_after()` function's incorrect usage, potentially leading to an incorrect size calculation. This aligned well with the \"*write beyond size of field*\" warning. CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) was added as a secondary factor in the error.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, offering sufficient specificity for this particular scenario.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n*   **CWE-131**: The **improper use of memset_after() function** on a different part of the union (status) than the original cast was from (rate_driver_data), which may confuse the compiler.\n*   **CWE-1284**: The `memset_after()` function expects a size argument, and the warning suggests this wasn't correctly validated in the context of the union members, potentially leading to a write beyond the intended boundary.\n\nOther CWEs Considered but Not Used:\n*   CWE-457 (Use of Uninitialized Variable): While potentially related to memory safety, the primary issue is the \"*write beyond size of field*,\" not the usage of uninitialized variables.\n*   CWE-909 (Missing Initialization of Resource): The issue is not about missing initialization but rather about **improper use of memset_after() function** that could lead to memory corruption.\n*   CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound): There's no explicit evidence of integer overflow in the description.",
