  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in SourceCodester Simple To-Do List System 1.0. Affected is an unknown function of the file /delete_task.php. The manipulation of the argument ID leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "The content relates to CVE-2025-4247.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nOn the ninth line of the `delete_task.php` file, the `$id` variable, which contains user input, is used directly in a database query without proper sanitization or validation. This allows for SQL injection attacks.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAttackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain database privileges, potentially leading to access to a large amount of data or even server host privileges if the database user has DBA rights.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The vulnerability exists in the `delete_task.php` file.\n*   An attacker can manipulate the `id` parameter in a request to this file to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the `delete_task.php` file. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not provide a specific fix, but implies that proper sanitization or validation of the `$id` variable before using it in the database query is necessary to prevent SQL injection.\n\n**POC:**\n\n`python3 sqlmap.py -u <http://localhost/delete_task.php?id=1> --dbms=mysql --technique=T`\n\nThe content provides more detail than the official CVE description would likely contain, specifically the line number in the vulnerable file and a proof-of-concept exploit using `sqlmap`.",
