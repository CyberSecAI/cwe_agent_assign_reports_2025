  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Incorta 2023.4.3. It has been classified as problematic. Affected is an unknown function of the component Edit Insight Handler. The manipulation of the argument Service Name leads to **csv injection**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

There are no parent-child or chain relationships that influence the selection in this case. The abstraction level is Base, which is the preferred level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1236[\"CWE-1236: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe1236 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **CSV Injection** due to **improper neutralization**.\n2.  **Impact:** Allows remote attackers to inject malicious formulas into CSV files.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states \"**csv injection**\" as the **weakness**. The vulnerability involves manipulating the \"Service Name\" argument to achieve this. The retriever results also list CWE-1236, Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File, as the top candidate.
