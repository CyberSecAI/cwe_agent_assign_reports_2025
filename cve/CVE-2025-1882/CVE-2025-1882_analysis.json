  "description": "A vulnerability was found in i-Drive i11 and i12 up to 20250227. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the component Device Setting Handler. The manipulation leads to **improper access control** for register interface. The attack needs to be done within the local network. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. It was not possible to identify the current maintainer of the product. It must be assumed that the product is end-of-life.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-1882 based on provided content\n\nThe content is directly relevant to CVE-2025-1882. It provides significantly more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe dashcam allows remote access to settings and configuration, exposing sensitive car and driver information. The authentication mechanism, while using a second factor (device pairing), is vulnerable due to MAC address spoofing.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Remote access to sensitive settings and configuration.\n*   Vulnerable device pairing based on MAC address recognition.\n*   Ability to manipulate device settings remotely.\n*   Potential to disable battery protection, leading to battery drain.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Exposure of sensitive car and driver information.\n*   Potential draining of the vehicle's battery.\n*   Deletion of recorded footage.\n*   Disabling of recording functionality.\n*   Factory reset of the device, erasing evidence.\n*   Masking remote activity by lowering volume.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Network access to the dashcam.\n*   MAC address spoofing.\n*   Exploitation of weak authentication.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Network access to the dashcam's network.\n*   Ability to perform ARP scanning to obtain MAC addresses.\n*   Capability to spoof MAC addresses.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not provide specific mitigation or fix details. However, it implies that strengthening the device pairing mechanism and securing remote access to settings are necessary.",

Given more specific information, it could be refined to CWE-306 (Missing Authentication), CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), or CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). The vulnerability description mentions \"**improper access control**\" directly, supporting the use of CWE-284 as a starting point. The analysis of CVE-2025-1882 suggests authentication weaknesses, making CWE-306, CWE-862, and CWE-863 relevant candidates.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe862,cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe287,cwe285 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper access control** (CWE-284). The analysis suggests that this could be due to missing authentication (CWE-306), missing authorization (CWE-862), or incorrect authorization (CWE-863). Successful exploitation leads to exposure of sensitive information, manipulation of device settings, and potential battery drain.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment points to CWE-284 due to the direct mention of \"**improper access control**\" in the vulnerability description. The analysis of the CVE reference link content reveals that authentication and authorization issues contribute to this **improper access control**, suggesting that CWE-306, CWE-862, and CWE-863 could also be relevant.\n\nCWE-284 is selected as the primary CWE because it directly reflects the stated **improper access control**. While more specific CWEs such as CWE-306, CWE-862, and CWE-863 could be applicable, the current evidence doesn't definitively point to one over the others, making the broader CWE-284 the most appropriate choice. The other CWEs are secondary candidates.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   **CWE-284: Improper Access Control**: This is a high-level category used when the access control failure exists but the root cause is unclear. It aligns with the general description of \"**improper access control**\" in the vulnerability.\n\n*   **CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function**: The analysis of CVE-2025-1882 points to weaknesses in the authentication mechanism, specifically related to device pairing using MAC address spoofing.\n\n*   **CWE-862: Missing Authorization**: Given the remote access to settings and configuration, it's possible that authorization checks are missing after a user is authenticated.\n\n*   **CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization**: The device pairing mechanism might be flawed, leading to incorrect authorization decisions.\n\nCWEs Considered but Not Used:\n\n*   CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')): While listed in the Retriever Results, there is no indication of XSS in the vulnerability description or CVE analysis.\n*   CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')): Similarly, there is no evidence of SQL injection.\n*   CWE-113 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')): There is no mention of HTTP header manipulation.\n*   CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read): There is no evidence of out-of-bounds reads.\n*   CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment): There is no specific information about incorrect privilege assignments.\n*   CWE-287 (Improper Authentication): While related to authentication, CWE-306 is more specific as it addresses missing authentication.\n*   CWE-927 (Use of Implicit Intent for Sensitive Communication): This is not relevant based on the description.\n*   CWE-1391 (Use of Weak Credentials): The MAC address spoofing doesn't necessarily indicate weak credentials.",
