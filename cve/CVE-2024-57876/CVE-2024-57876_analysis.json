  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/dp_mst Fix resetting msg rx state after topology removal If the MST topology is removed during the reception of an MST down reply or MST up request sideband message, the drm_dp_mst_topology_mgrup_req_recv/down_rep_recv states could be reset from one thread via drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_set_mst(false), racing with the reading/parsing of the message from another thread via drm_dp_mst_handle_down_rep() or drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req(). The race is possible since the reader/parser doesnt hold any lock while accessing the reception state. This in turn can lead to a **memory corruption** in the reader/parser as described by commit bd2fccac61b4 (drm/dp_mst Fix MST sideband message body length check). Fix the above by resetting the message reception state if needed before reading/parsing a message. Another solution would be to hold the drm_dp_mst_topology_mgrlock for the whole duration of the message reception/parsing in drm_dp_mst_handle_down_rep() and drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req(), however this would require a bigger change. Since the fix is also needed for stable, opting for the simpler solution in this patch.",

This can lead to **memory corruption**, specifically an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). CWE-362 is a Class-level CWE, while CWE-787 is a Base-level CWE. The \"CanPrecede\" and \"CanFollow\" relationships are not directly applicable here, but the hierarchical relationship is useful: CWE-787 is a potential consequence of CWE-362 when the race condition leads to writing outside of allocated memory. The abstraction levels influenced the decision to select CWE-362 as the primary because the description highlights the concurrency issue as the root cause, and the memory corruption is a potential outcome of the race condition.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe362 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with concurrent access to a shared resource without proper synchronization (CWE-362). This race condition can lead to **memory corruption**, specifically an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).\n\nCWE-362 (Race Condition) -> CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered the **memory corruption** as a potential direct cause, potentially leading to CWE-787. However, further review of the description revealed that the root cause is the race condition due to the lack of proper locking mechanisms. The vulnerability description states that \"the drm_dp_mst_topology_mgrup_req_recv/down_rep_recv states could be reset from one thread via drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_set_mst(false), racing with the reading/parsing of the message from another thread via drm_dp_mst_handle_down_rep() or drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req(). The race is possible since the reader/parser doesnt hold any lock while accessing the reception state.\" This clearly points to a concurrency issue.\n\nThe provided evidence supports classifying this vulnerability as CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')). The race condition can then manifest as a **memory corruption**, specifically an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). CWE-362 is at the Class level, and CWE-787 is at the Base level. Since the description explicitly mentions the race condition as the root cause, CWE-362 is selected as the primary CWE. The fix implemented also points to this, where the message reception state is reset before parsing the message to avoid the race.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Used:* Though related, CWE-667 is a more general case.
