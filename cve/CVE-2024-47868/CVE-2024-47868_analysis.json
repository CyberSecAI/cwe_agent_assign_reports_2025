  "description": "Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This is a ****data validation vulnerability**** affecting several Gradio components, which allows arbitrary file leaks through the post-processing step. Attackers can exploit these components by crafting requests that bypass expected input constraints. This issue could lead to sensitive files being exposed to unauthorized users, especially when combined with other vulnerabilities, such as issue TOB-GRADIO-15. The components most at risk are those that return or handle file data. Vulnerable Components 1. **String to FileData** DownloadButton, Audio, ImageEditor, Video, Model3D, File, UploadButton. 2. **Complex data to FileData** Chatbot, MultimodalTextbox. 3. **Direct file read in preprocess** Code. 4. **Dictionary converted to FileData** ParamViewer, Dataset. Exploit Scenarios 1. A developer creates a Dropdown list that passes values to a DownloadButton. An attacker bypasses the allowed inputs, sends an arbitrary file path (like `/etc/passwd`), and downloads sensitive files. 2. An attacker crafts a malicious payload in a ParamViewer component, leaking sensitive files from a server through the arbitrary file leak. This issue has been resolved in `gradio>5.0`. Upgrading to the latest version will mitigate this vulnerability. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

The vulnerability description also mentions bypassing expected input constraints as the attack vector. This indicates a failure to adequately validate user inputs, making CWE-20 the most appropriate root cause.\n\nThe Retriever Results suggested more specific CWEs like CWE-22 (Path Traversal) and CWE-93 (CRLF Injection). While these could be potential consequences of the **improper input validation**, the core issue is the **lack of validation** itself. CWE-22 is a possible attack vector given the ability to supply arbitrary file paths.\n\nThe graph relationships support the understanding that **improper input validation** can lead to other vulnerabilities like path traversal.\n\nThe selection of CWE-20 and CWE-22 is at an appropriate level of specificity. CWE-20 captures the general **failure to validate input**, while CWE-22 describes how this **failure** can lead to path traversal and arbitrary file access.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
