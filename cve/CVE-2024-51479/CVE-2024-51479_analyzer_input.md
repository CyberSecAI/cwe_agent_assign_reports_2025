# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-51479

## Vulnerability Description
Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. In affected versions if a Next.js application is performing authorization in middleware based on pathname, it was possible for this authorization to be bypassed for pages directly under the applications root directory. For example * [Not affected] `https//example.com/` * [Affected] `https//example.com/foo` * [Not affected] `https//example.com/foo/bar`. This issue is patched in Next.js `14.2.15` and later. If your Next.js application is hosted on Vercel, this vulnerability has been automatically mitigated, regardless of Next.js version. There are no official workarounds for this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** bypass authorization in middleware
- **product:** Next.js

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-51479

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how Next.js applications were handling authorization in middleware based on the pathname.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Authorization Bypass:** It was possible to bypass authorization checks if they were implemented in middleware based on pathname. This means that unauthorized users could potentially gain access to protected resources by manipulating the request in a way not properly handled by the middleware.
- **Inadequate Pathname Handling:** The underlying cause is related to how Next.js processes or interprets pathnames, leading to potential bypass scenarios.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could bypass intended authorization mechanisms, gaining access to protected resources or functionalities without proper authentication.
- **Confidentiality Violation:** Exploiting this vulnerability could result in the exposure of sensitive data. Though the CVSS metrics rate confidentiality impact as high, integrity and availability are none.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **Pathname manipulation:** The attack likely involves crafting specific requests with manipulated pathnames, which the vulnerable middleware fails to process correctly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No privileges are required.** The attacker does not need any pre-existing access to the system.
- **No user interaction is required.** The attacker does not need to trick a user into performing any actions to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Next.js versions `9.5.5` up to and including `14.2.14`.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version `14.2.15`
- Vercel deployments are automatically mitigated, regardless of the Next.js version used.
- The vulnerability was reported by tyage (GMO CyberSecurity by IERAE).
- The CVSS score is 7.5, with a high confidentiality impact

The provided information is more descriptive than a typical CVE, providing details about the vulnerable versions, patch version, mitigation and the specific component affected by the vulnerability.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
