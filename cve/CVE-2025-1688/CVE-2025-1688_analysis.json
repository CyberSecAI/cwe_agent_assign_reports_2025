  "description": "Milestone Systems has discovered a security vulnerability in Milestone XProtect installer that resets system configuration password after the upgrading from older versions using specific installers. The system configuration password is an additional, optional protection that is enabled on the Management Server. To mitigate the issue, we highly recommend updating system configuration password via GUI with a standard procedure. Any system upgraded with 2024 R1 or 2024 R2 release installer is vulnerable to this issue. Systems upgraded from 2023 R3 or older with version 2025 R1 and newer are not affected.",
