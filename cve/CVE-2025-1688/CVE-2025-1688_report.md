# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-1688

## Description

Milestone Systems has discovered a security vulnerability in Milestone XProtect installer that resets system configuration password after the upgrading from older versions using specific installers. The system configuration password is an additional, optional protection that is enabled on the Management Server. To mitigate the issue, we highly recommend updating system configuration password via GUI with a standard procedure. Any system upgraded with 2024 R1 or 2024 R2 release installer is vulnerable to this issue. Systems upgraded from 2023 R3 or older with version 2025 R1 and newer are not affected.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Impact:** resets system configuration password
- **Product:** Milestone XProtect installer
- **Version:** 2024 R1 or 2024 R2

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect** password reset mechanism during the upgrade process, leading to an **impact** of the system configuration password being reset without proper verification.
  - **ROOT CAUSE:** **Incorrect** password reset mechanism (Implied)
  - **IMPACT:** System configuration password reset without verification

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is heavily based on the provided vulnerability description, as there is no CVE Reference Links Content Summary to provide detailed evidence of the **root cause** of the weakness. The vulnerability description indicates that the Milestone XProtect installer resets the system configuration password after upgrading from older versions using specific installers.

The Retriever Results suggest CWE-620 as a potential candidate with a relatively high score.

*   **CWE-620 (Unverified Password Change):** The description states that the system configuration password is reset, implying that the password change is not verified. This aligns with the definition of CWE-620: "When setting a new password for a user, the product does not require knowledge of the original password, or using another form of authentication."

Due to the limited evidence, the assessment relies on the vulnerability description and the suggested CWE from the retriever results.
