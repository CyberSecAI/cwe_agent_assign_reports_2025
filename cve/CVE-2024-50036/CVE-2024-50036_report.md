# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-50036

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net do not delay dst_entries_add() in dst_release() dst_entries_add() uses per-cpu data that might be freed at netns dismantle from ip6_route_net_exit() calling dst_entries_destroy() Before ip6_route_net_exit() can be called, we release all the dsts associated with this netns, via calls to dst_release(), which waits an rcu grace period before calling dst_destroy() dst_entries_add() use in dst_destroy() is racy, because dst_entries_destroy() could have been called already. Decrementing the number of dsts must happen sooner. Notes 1) in CONFIG_XFRM case, dst_destroy() can call dst_release_immediate(child), this might also cause UAF if the child does not have DST_NOCOUNT set. IPSEC maintainers might take a look and see how to address this. 2) There is also discussion about removing this count of dst, which might happen in future kernels.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** Use-After-Free
- **Vector:** freeing per-cpu data from ip6_route_net_exit(), then accessing it from dst_destroy()
- **Product:** Linux kernel
- **Component:** net do not delay dst_entries_add() in dst_release()

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is that **CWE-416** [Use After Free] can be caused by a race condition, specifically **CWE-362** [Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')]. The vulnerability description clearly indicates a race condition leading to a use-after-free scenario. **CWE-416** is a variant, which is a more specific level of abstraction, making it a better fit than its parent.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** (**CWE-362** [Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')]) where per-cpu data can be freed prematurely. This leads to a **use-after-free** (**CWE-416** [Use After Free]) when `dst_entries_add()` attempts to access the freed data.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The key phrases "rootcause: **Use-After-Free**" and the description of the race condition are critical.

The CVE reference summary confirms: "The vulnerability stems from a **race condition** ... leading to a **use-after-free (UAF)** vulnerability."

**CWE-416** [Use After Free] is selected as the primary CWE because it directly represents the **rootcause** of the vulnerability. It's a Variant-level CWE, providing a good level of specificity.

**CWE-362** [Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')] is considered as a secondary CWE because the race condition enables the use-after-free.

The retriever results support this assessment, with **CWE-416** [Use After Free] having the highest score, and **CWE-362** [Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')] also appearing in the top results. The graph relationships further reinforce this connection.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
If two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

**Mapping Guidance**:

- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.
