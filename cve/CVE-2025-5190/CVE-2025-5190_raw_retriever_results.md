# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-5190
## Query
The Browse As plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 0.2. This is due to incorrect authentication checking in the IS_BA_Browse_Asnotice function with the is_ba_original_user_COOKIEHASH cookie value. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the user id.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'incorrect authentication checking'
- **weakness**: 'authentication bypass'
