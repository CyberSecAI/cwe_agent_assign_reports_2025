  "reference_content": "**1. Does the content relate to the CVE?**\n\nYes, the content directly relates to CVE-2025-24947, which concerns a Hash Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack in QUIC implementations, specifically in the lsquic library.\n\n**2. If yes, extract the relevant information:**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of weak hash functions within QUIC implementations when handling Source Connection IDs (SCIDs). Specifically, the lsquic library used a hash function (lsquic\\_hash) that was susceptible to collision attacks. Attackers could craft malicious SCIDs to trigger collisions, leading to a denial-of-service condition.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The weakness is the use of a hash table indexed by the peer's SCID to manage connections and the use of a hash function that allows for easy collision creation.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation results in a Hash Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, causing significant slowdowns in vulnerable servers. The attacker can force the server to spend its resources inserting and looking up colliding connection IDs. Some experimental results showed a 300x slowdown.\n*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker can create malicious SCIDs that collide within the hash function used by the vulnerable server. The server uses the SCID to index the connection, and these collisions cause the server to spend a lot of time looking up connections.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to initiate QUIC connections and specify the SCID. They need to craft the SCIDs to cause collisions within the hash table used by the vulnerable server.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** The fix involved switching the hash function to rapidhash with a stronger random seed.\n\n**3. More detail than CVE description:**\n\nYes, the content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It includes:\n*   A detailed technical explanation of hash table vulnerabilities.\n*   An explanation of the QUIC protocol and how the vulnerability arises within it.\n*   Examples of the impact of the vulnerability and experimental results.\n*   A timeline of the disclosure and fix.",

The fix involved switching to a stronger hash function, further solidifying the connection to **CWE-328**.\n\nI am selecting **CWE-400** because the **impact** is resource consumption, and **CWE-328** because the **rootcause** is the weak hash.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
