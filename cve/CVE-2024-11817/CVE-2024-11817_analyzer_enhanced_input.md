### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** PHPGurukul User Registration & Login and User Management System
- **version:** 1
- **component:** /admin/index.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability found in the `/admin/index.php` file of the 'User Registration & Login and User Management System With admin panel' project.
- The vulnerability arises because user-supplied input from the `username` parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it doesn't properly sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the `username` parameter in the login form is directly incorporated into the database query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can potentially access and steal sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data.
- **Comprehensive System Control:** Attackers might achieve control over the system via the database.
- **Service Interruption:** Exploitation can lead to a disruption of services.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `username` parameter in the login form located at `/admin/index.php`.
- Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through this parameter when attempting to log in.
- The vulnerability is exploitable via a POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the `/admin/index.php` endpoint.
- No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability as stated in the provided text.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

- The provided content includes proof of concept (POC) payloads for boolean-based blind and time-based blind SQL injection techniques, along with a sqlmap command used to identify the vulnerability, showcasing how an attacker can discover and exploit the weakness.
- The content also suggests remediation measures including using prepared statements, input validation and filtering, minimizing database user permissions, and regular security audits.

This information is more detailed than a standard CVE description, offering specific details about the vulnerable parameter, attack vectors, and how the vulnerability can be exploited.
