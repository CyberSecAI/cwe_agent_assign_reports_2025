## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's an analysis of the provided content:

**Content from git.dcmtk.org_496cd5b2_20250624_164343.html:**

*   **Relates to CVE-2024-52333:** YES
*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is in the `determineMinMax` function. The vulnerability is due to missing checks on the value corresponding to `*p` against the size allocated for the pointer `q`.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-buffer-overflow in `DiInputPixelTemplate<unsigned short, unsigned char>::determineMinMax()` function, leading to memory corruption.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Memory corruption that could lead to a crash.
*   **Attack vectors:**  A malicious DICOM file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to supply a specially crafted DICOM file to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** The vendor has added a check to make sure `HighBit < BitsAllocated`.
