The **improper validation** allows the program to proceed with an array index that is outside the bounds of the allocated memory, which then leads to the **out-of-bounds write**.

CWE-787 [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write] is selected as a secondary CWE because it is the direct result of the **improper validation**. Both are at appropriate levels of abstraction (Variant and Base, respectively).\n\nOther considered CWEs:\n*   CWE-119 [CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer]: While relevant, it is a higher-level class and less specific than CWE-787 [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write]. The description for CWE-119 discourages its use when lower-level CWEs are available.\n*   CWE-125 [CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read]: Not applicable because the vulnerability involves writing, not reading, out of bounds.\n*   CWE-190 [CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound]: While an integer overflow could potentially contribute to an **improper array index**, the description doesn't explicitly mention it.\n*   CWE-1285 [CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input]: Similar to CWE-129 [CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index], but CWE-129 [CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index] is more specific to arrays.\n*   CWE-1284 [CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input]: This is a more general case of **improper validation** related to quantity, not specific to array indices.\n*   CWE-122 [CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow]: This is a type of buffer overflow and while it is mentioned in the summary, the root cause is the array index.\n*   CWE-131 [CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size]: The issue is not with the buffer size calculation but with how array indices are validated.\n* CWE-824 [CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer]: There is no uninitialized pointer present.\n* CWE-193 [CWE-193: Off-by-one Error]: Not applicable because the vulnerability involves a general **improper validation** of an array index, not specifically an off-by-one error.",
