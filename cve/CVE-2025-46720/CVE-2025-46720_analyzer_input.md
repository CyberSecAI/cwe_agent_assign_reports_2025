# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-46720

## Vulnerability Description
Keystone is a content management system for Node.js. Prior to version 6.5.0, `{field}.isFilterable` access control can be bypassed in `update` and `delete` mutations by adding additional unique filters. These filters can be used as an oracle to probe the existence or value of otherwise unreadable fields. Specifically, when a mutation includes a `where` clause with multiple unique filters (e.g. `id` and `email`), Keystone will attempt to match records even if filtering by the latter fields would normally be rejected by `field.isFilterable` or `list.defaultIsFilterable`. This can allow malicious actors to infer the presence of a particular field value when a filter is successful in returning a result. This affects any project relying on the default or dynamic `isFilterable` behavior (at the list or field level) to prevent external users from using the filtering of fields as a discovery mechanism. While this access control is respected during `findMany` operations, it was not completely enforced during `update` and `delete` mutations when accepting more than one unique `where` values in filters. This has no impact on projects using `isFilterable false` or `defaultIsFilterable false` for sensitive fields, or for those who have otherwise omitted filtering by these fields from their GraphQL schema. This issue has been patched in `@keystone-6/core` version 6.5.0. To mitigate this issue in older versions where patching is not a viable pathway, set `isFilterable false` statically for relevant fields to prevent filtering by them earlier in the access control pipeline (that is, dont use functions) set `{field}.graphql.omit.read true` for relevant fields, which implicitly removes filtering by these fields from the GraphQL schema and/or deny `update` and `delete` operations for the relevant lists completely.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-46720 Content

This content **relates** to CVE-2025-46720. It provides significantly more detail than the placeholder CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `isFilterable` access control can be bypassed in `update` and `delete` mutations when using multiple unique filters in the `where` clause. Keystone attempts to match records even if filtering by certain fields would normally be rejected by `isFilterable` or `defaultIsFilterable`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Incomplete enforcement of `isFilterable` access control during `update` and `delete` mutations with multiple unique filters.
*   Potential for information leakage through filter success/failure as an oracle.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Malicious actors can infer the presence or value of otherwise unreadable fields by observing the success or failure of filters in `update` and `delete` mutations. This affects projects relying on `isFilterable` to prevent field discovery.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Exploitation occurs through `update` and `delete` mutations with a `where` clause containing multiple unique filters.
*   Network-based attack vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Low privileges required.
*   No user interaction required.
*   Attacker needs to be able to send GraphQL `update` or `delete` mutations.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Upgrade to `@keystone-6/core` version 6.5.0 or later.
*   **Workarounds (for older versions):**
    *   Set `{field}.isFilterable: false` statically for sensitive fields.
    *   Set `{field}.graphql.omit.read: true` for sensitive fields.
    *   Deny `update` and `delete` operations for the relevant lists.

**CVSS Score:** 3.1 / 10

**CVSS v3 base metrics:**

*   Attack Vector: Network
*   Attack Complexity: High
*   Privileges Required: Low
*   User Interaction: None
*   Scope: Unchanged
*   Confidentiality: Low
*   Integrity: None
*   Availability: None

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
