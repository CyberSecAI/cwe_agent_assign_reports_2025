# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-50342

## Description

symfony/http-client is a module for the Symphony PHP framework which provides powerful methods to fetch HTTP resources synchronously or asynchronously. When using the `NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient`, some internal information is still leaking during host resolution, which leads to possible IP/port enumeration. As of versions 5.4.46, 6.4.14, and 7.1.7 the `NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient` now filters blocked IPs earlier to prevent such leaks. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Impact:** possible IP/port enumeration
- **Product:** symfony/http-client
- **Component:** NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-203 | Observable Discrepancy | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-497 | Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy), is at the Base level. It represents a situation where the product behaves differently, exposing information about its state.

CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) and CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere) are also at the Base level.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper** filtering of blocked IPs by the `NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient`, which leads to observable discrepancies in responses based on whether the target IP is internal or not. This allows for possible IP/port enumeration, which constitutes information disclosure.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identifies several candidate CWEs based on the provided information. The **root cause** is that `NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient` was not filtering blocked IPs early enough during host resolution which allowed internal information, specifically IP addresses and ports, to leak.

CWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy) is chosen as the primary CWE. The vulnerability exposes internal IP addresses and ports through observable differences in responses based on whether the connection is to an internal or external address. This matches the description of CWE-203 where the product behaves differently, revealing security-relevant information.

CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) and CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere) were also considered. The leakage of IP addresses can be viewed as the insertion of sensitive information (CWE-201), but the core weakness is the observable difference that allows the enumeration (CWE-203). Similarly, CWE-497 is a possible fit but not as precise as CWE-203.

The selection is based on the evidence that the **lack of filtering** leads to **observable discrepancies**, making CWE-203 the most accurate representation of the vulnerability. The other CWEs are secondary candidates as they describe related aspects but not the primary weakness.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
