## Vulnerability Description
symfony/http-client is a module for the Symphony PHP framework which provides powerful methods to fetch HTTP resources synchronously or asynchronously. When using the `NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient`, some internal information is still leaking during host resolution, which leads to possible IP/port enumeration. As of versions 5.4.46, 6.4.14, and 7.1.7 the `NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient` now filters blocked IPs earlier to prevent such leaks. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** possible IP/port enumeration
- **product:** symfony/http-client
- **component:** NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The `NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient` in the Symfony HTTP client was not filtering blocked IPs early enough during host resolution. This allowed internal information, specifically IP addresses and ports, to leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Internal Address and Port Enumeration:** The primary vulnerability is the leakage of internal IP addresses and potentially port information. This is due to the `NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient` not effectively blocking connections to private network addresses during the initial stages of a request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially use this information to map out internal networks, identifying available services and machines within the environment.
*   **Reconnaissance:** This vulnerability could be used as part of a larger reconnaissance effort, allowing an attacker to gather information before launching a more targeted attack.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can exploit this by crafting requests that resolve to private IP addresses and observing the responses or lack thereof.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application using the vulnerable `NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient`.
*   **Knowledge of Internal Network:** The attacker would ideally have some knowledge or the ability to test which IP address ranges are internal to the target environment.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of `symfony/http-client` before 5.4.47, between 6.0.0 and 6.4.15, and between 7.0.0 and 7.1.8.
*   The fix involves filtering blocked IPs earlier in the connection process.
*   Patches are available in commits `296d4b34a33b1a6ca5475c6040b3203622520f5b` and `b4bf5afdbdcb2fd03da513ee03beeabeb551e5fa`
*   The vulnerability is rated as low severity with CVSS score of 3.1

**Summary of Changes in the Fix:**

The provided diff shows that the fix involves:
1.  **Filtering IPs based on the hostname:** The code now checks if the resolved host (hostname) is a private IP and throws an exception if it is.
2.  **Filtering IPs based on the resolved IP:** The code now also checks if the resolved IP address during the connection process is a private IP and throws an exception if it is.
3. The test case was updated to reflect the fix of filtering private IPs when Host == IP.
