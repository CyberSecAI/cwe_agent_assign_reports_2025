  "description": "symfony/http-client is a module for the Symphony PHP framework which provides powerful methods to fetch HTTP resources synchronously or asynchronously. When using the `NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient`, some internal information is still leaking during host resolution, which leads to possible IP/port enumeration. As of versions 5.4.46, 6.4.14, and 7.1.7 the `NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient` now filters blocked IPs earlier to prevent such leaks. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe `NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient` in the Symfony HTTP client was not filtering blocked IPs early enough during host resolution. This allowed internal information, specifically IP addresses and ports, to leak.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Internal Address and Port Enumeration:** The primary vulnerability is the leakage of internal IP addresses and potentially port information. This is due to the `NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient` not effectively blocking connections to private network addresses during the initial stages of a request.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially use this information to map out internal networks, identifying available services and machines within the environment.\n*   **Reconnaissance:** This vulnerability could be used as part of a larger reconnaissance effort, allowing an attacker to gather information before launching a more targeted attack.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can exploit this by crafting requests that resolve to private IP addresses and observing the responses or lack thereof.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application using the vulnerable `NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient`.\n*   **Knowledge of Internal Network:** The attacker would ideally have some knowledge or the ability to test which IP address ranges are internal to the target environment.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability affects versions of `symfony/http-client` before 5.4.47, between 6.0.0 and 6.4.15, and between 7.0.0 and 7.1.8.\n*   The fix involves filtering blocked IPs earlier in the connection process.\n*   Patches are available in commits `296d4b34a33b1a6ca5475c6040b3203622520f5b` and `b4bf5afdbdcb2fd03da513ee03beeabeb551e5fa`\n*   The vulnerability is rated as low severity with CVSS score of 3.1\n\n**Summary of Changes in the Fix:**\n\nThe provided diff shows that the fix involves:\n1.  **Filtering IPs based on the hostname:** The code now checks if the resolved host (hostname) is a private IP and throws an exception if it is.\n2.  **Filtering IPs based on the resolved IP:** The code now also checks if the resolved IP address during the connection process is a private IP and throws an exception if it is.\n3. The test case was updated to reflect the fix of filtering private IPs when Host == IP.",

It represents a situation where the product behaves differently, exposing information about its state.\n\nCWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) and CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere) are also at the Base level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe203[\"CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe203 primary\n    class cwe201,cwe497 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper** filtering of blocked IPs by the `NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient`, which leads to observable discrepancies in responses based on whether the target IP is internal or not. This allows for possible IP/port enumeration, which constitutes information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identifies several candidate CWEs based on the provided information. The **root cause** is that `NoPrivateNetworkHttpClient` was not filtering blocked IPs early enough during host resolution which allowed internal information, specifically IP addresses and ports, to leak.\n\nCWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy) is chosen as the primary CWE. The vulnerability exposes internal IP addresses and ports through observable differences in responses based on whether the connection is to an internal or external address. This matches the description of CWE-203 where the product behaves differently, revealing security-relevant information.\n\nCWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) and CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere) were also considered. The leakage of IP addresses can be viewed as the insertion of sensitive information (CWE-201), but the core weakness is the observable difference that allows the enumeration (CWE-203). Similarly, CWE-497 is a possible fit but not as precise as CWE-203.\n\nThe selection is based on the evidence that the **lack of filtering** leads to **observable discrepancies**, making CWE-203 the most accurate representation of the vulnerability. The other CWEs are secondary candidates as they describe related aspects but not the primary weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified
