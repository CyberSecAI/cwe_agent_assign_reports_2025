**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-0300
**CVE Description:** PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval

**Content Analysis:**

The gist (gist.github.com_780f1eed_20250624_142903.html) details a SQL Injection vulnerability in the `subcat.php` file of an "Online Book Shop Using PHP" application.  The code-projects.org link (code-projects.org_36db8cd3_20250624_142902.html) lists this project. This directly relates to a potential vulnerability.

**Extracted Information:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application directly incorporates the `$cat` GET parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or validation.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**  Unauthorized access to the server database, potential Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Attack vectors:**  Manipulating the `cat` GET parameter in the URL of the `/subcat.php` script.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to craft and send malicious HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** The gist does not provide a fix, but the vulnerability can be mitigated by using parameterized queries or properly escaping user input before including it in SQL statements.

**Details beyond the CVE description:**

The gist provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating how to enumerate databases and potentially gain OS-shell access using `sqlmap`. This level of detail is not typically found in a standard CVE description.
