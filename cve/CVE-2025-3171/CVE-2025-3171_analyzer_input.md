## Analysis of CVE-2025-3171 Content

This content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it's a report *about* a vulnerability, not the CVE description itself. It provides more detail than a typical CVE description would.

Here's the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/approve_lawyer.php` file of the 'Time Table Generator' project.
*   The vulnerability is due to the direct use of the `unblock_id` parameter in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   System control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The `unblock_id` parameter in a GET request to `/approve_lawyer.php?unblock_id=1` is vulnerable.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to craft malicious SQL queries and send them via the `unblock_id` parameter. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.
2.  **Input validation and filtering:** Validate and filter user input to ensure it conforms to the expected format.
3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the minimum necessary permissions.
4.  **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

**Payload Examples (from the report):**

*   `unblock_id=1' AND 2263=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (2263=2263) THEN 2263 ELSE (SELECT 8373 UNION SELECT 3260) END))-- AXmT` (boolean-based blind)
*   `unblock_id=1' OR (SELECT 9323 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x7162767a71,(SELECT (ELT(9323=9323,1))),0x7170707671,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a)-- tHol` (error-based)
*   `unblock_id=1' AND (SELECT 3983 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))FzWm)-- VWhB` (time-based blind)

**Affected Software:**

*   Time Table Generator System using PHP and MySQL - Version 1.0
