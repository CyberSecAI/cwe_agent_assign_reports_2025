  "description": "auth-js is an isomorphic Javascript library for Supabase Auth. Prior to version 2.69.1, the library functions getUserById, deleteUser, updateUserById, listFactors and deleteFactor did not require the user supplied values to be valid UUIDs. This could lead to a **URL path traversal**, resulting in the wrong API function being called. Implementations that follow security best practice and validate user controlled inputs, such as the userId are not affected by this. This issue has been patched in version 2.69.1.",

This could lead to a URL path traversal, resulting in the wrong API function being called.\n- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: URL path traversal.\n- Impact of exploitation: Calling the wrong API function.\n- Attack vectors: Passing malformed user input to the library functions `getUserById`, `deleteUser`, `updateUserById`, `listFactors` and `deleteFactor`.\n- Required attacker capabilities/position: User controlled input.\n- Mitigation or fix: Strict value checks have been added to all affected functions. These functions now require that the `userId` and `factorId` parameters MUST be valid UUID (v4).  Patched version: >= 2.69.1.\n- More detail than the official CVE description: Yes\n```",

CWE-73 is a parent of CWE-22 and represents external control of file name or path. CWE-639 represents authorization bypass through a user-controlled key. The **URL path traversal** occurs because the user can control the input that defines the path, leading to the execution of the wrong API function.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n\n    cwe22 -->|CHILDOF| cwe73\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe73,cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of validation** of user-supplied UUIDs.
