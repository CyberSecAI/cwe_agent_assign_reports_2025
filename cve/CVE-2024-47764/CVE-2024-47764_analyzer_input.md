# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-47764

## Vulnerability Description
cookie is a basic HTTP cookie parser and serializer for HTTP servers. The cookie name could be used to set other fields of the cookie, resulting in an unexpected cookie value. A similar escape can be used for path and domain, which could be abused to alter other fields of the cookie. Upgrade to 0.7.0, which updates the validation for name, path, and domain.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper escaping**
- **impact:** construct unexpected cookie value
- **product:** cookie

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47764:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of cookie names, paths, and domain values during serialization. The `cookie` library was using a broad regular expression (`fieldContentRegExp` from RFC7230) intended for the entire cookie header, instead of more specific regular expressions for individual cookie components (name, path, domain) as defined in RFC6265. This allowed characters beyond the allowed sets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The library failed to properly validate cookie names, paths, and domains against the specific character sets allowed by RFC6265.
*   **Incorrect Regular Expression Usage:** A generic regex for the whole header was used for individual parts instead of more restrictive ones.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cookie Manipulation:** By crafting malicious cookie names, attackers could inject other cookie attributes, such as `Max-Age` and others, leading to unexpected cookie behavior. For example, the attacker could set a username cookie to `<script>` code, resulting in XSS when the cookie value was interpreted in an insecure context.
*   **Path and Domain Alteration:** Similar manipulation could occur with `path` and `domain`, potentially leading to unexpected cookie scoping and access.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Potential:** The ability to inject script tags directly into cookie values could result in XSS vulnerabilities if the cookie is later used in a page without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Cookie Name/Value:** An attacker could provide a cookie name or value containing characters that exploit the insufficient validation. The name could be constructed to include other cookie directives, like `Max-Age` or `path`.
*   **Malicious Path/Domain Values:** Similarly, crafted `path` or `domain` values could bypass the validation and lead to unexpected behavior.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control Over Cookie Attributes:** The attacker needs some control over the cookie name, path, or domain values being serialized by the application. This might involve user input or data from other sources that is not sanitized properly by the application.
*   **Application Misconfiguration**: The vulnerable cookie library must be used in an application without additional sanitization of the cookie attributes.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of the `cookie` library prior to 0.7.0.
*   The fix was implemented in version 0.7.0 by narrowing the validation using regexes matching the RFC.
*   The provided content includes a pull request that fixes this issue (PR #167).
* The content also includes a number of PR's in downstream packages bumping the library version to the fixed version.
*   The vulnerability is considered "low" severity.
*   The fix involved correcting the regular expressions to match the specific RFC6265 requirements for cookie names, paths, and domains.
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by upgrading to version 0.7.0 or later. As a workaround, application developers should avoid using untrusted or arbitrary values for cookie names, paths, and domains, ensuring that these are instead set by the application itself.
