# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-47764

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-47764

## Description

cookie is a basic HTTP cookie parser and serializer for HTTP servers. The cookie name could be used to set other fields of the cookie, resulting in an unexpected cookie value. A similar escape can be used for path and domain, which could be abused to alter other fields of the cookie. Upgrade to 0.7.0, which updates the validation for name, path, and domain.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** improper escaping
- **Impact:** construct unexpected cookie value
- **Product:** cookie

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-113 which is a variant of CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) and CWE-93 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences). This hierarchical relationship indicates a more specific instance of a broader input validation issue. The chain relationship CANPRECEDE -> CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting) suggests that improper neutralization of CRLF sequences can lead to XSS vulnerabilities. CWE-184 provides a secondary classification for the incomplete nature of the disallowed input list.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper escaping** due to **inadequate input validation** of cookie names, paths, and domains. This leads to the ability to inject other cookie attributes, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the cookie value is later used without proper sanitization.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on the **improper escaping** of cookie values, leading to potential injection of malicious content. The evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly indicates that the root cause is due to **insufficient validation** of cookie names, paths, and domains as defined in RFC6265. The `cookie` library incorrectly used a generic regular expression instead of specific ones, leading to an **incomplete list of disallowed inputs**. This directly aligns with CWE-113, as it involves improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers due to insufficient input validation. The relationship analysis further supports this decision, as CWE-113 is a variant of CWE-20 and can precede CWE-79. The selection of CWE-113 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it precisely describes the improper handling of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers, which is the core weakness in this vulnerability. CWE-184 is a secondary weakness as the regex used was too broad.
