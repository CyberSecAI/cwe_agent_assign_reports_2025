## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
CVE-2025-1166 is related to the content.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the upload logic of the `update.php` file, which only uses the `getimagesize()` function to detect the file type. This allows bypassing image type detection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient file type validation.
- Reliance on `getimagesize()` for file type detection, which can be bypassed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Upload of malicious Trojan files.
- Potential for remote code execution (RCE) via PHP code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Uploading a GIF89a file containing malicious PHP code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to upload files to the server.
- Knowledge of PHP and GIF89a format.

**Mitigation or fix:**
The content does not provide a specific fix, but implies stronger file type validation is needed beyond `getimagesize()`.

The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit.
