## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved perf/aux Fix AUX buffer serialization Ole reported that event->mmap_mutex is strictly insufficient to serialize the AUX buffer, add a per RB mutex to fully serialize it. Note that in the lock order comment the perf_eventmmap_mutex order was already wrong, that is, it nesting under mmap_lock is not new with this patch.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient locking**
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** perf/aux buffer serialization
