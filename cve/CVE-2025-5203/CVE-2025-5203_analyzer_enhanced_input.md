## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. It has been rated as problematic. Affected by this issue is the function SkipSpaces in the library assimp/include/assimp/ParsingUtils.h. The manipulation leads to **out-of-bounds read**. Local access is required to approach this attack. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The project decided to collect all Fuzzer bugs in a main-issue to address them in the future.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **out-of-bounds read**
- **product:** Open Asset Import Library Assimp
- **version:** 5.4.3
- **component:** assimp/include/assimp/ParsingUtils.h

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2025-5203 (assuming a placeholder description exists):

**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-5203

**Analysis:**

The content relates to vulnerabilities found in the assimp library, specifically through fuzzing and sanitizers (like ASAN).  The issues are tracked under epic #6128 and include a specific bug report (#6175) detailing a heap out-of-bounds read.

**Relevant Information (from issue #6175):**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `while` loop condition in `SkipSpaces<char>` dereferences a pointer *before* checking if it's valid, leading to a potential read outside the allocated memory.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap out-of-bounds read.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**  The ASAN output indicates a heap-buffer-overflow, which could lead to crashes or potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing, suggesting that specially crafted input files could trigger the issue.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious file that assimp attempts to parse.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** The issue report doesn't provide a fix, but suggests the loop condition needs to be reordered to check the pointer before dereferencing it.
*   **Affected code locations:**
    *   `assimp/include/assimp/ParsingUtils.h` (lines 106, 122, 127, 143)

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description would, including the specific code location and ASAN output.
*   The epic #6128 tracks multiple fuzzing/sanitizer-discovered bugs, so this is likely not the only vulnerability in assimp.
*   The issue is labeled as a "Bug", "Fuzzer", and "Sanitizer", indicating its origin and nature.
*   The reproducer.zip file is available for testing.
