|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-290 | Authentication Bypass by Spoofing | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** LOW

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass by Spoofing), which is a Base level CWE. This choice is influenced by the vulnerability description that mentions "**Spoofing Vulnerability**". While other CWEs like CWE-294 (Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay) and CWE-297 (Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch) were considered, CWE-290 directly aligns with the described vulnerability. The relationships show that CWE-290 is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and CWE-1390 (Authentication Bypass).

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** that enables **spoofing**, leading to NTLM Hash Disclosure.
  - **Root Cause:** Vulnerability that allows spoofing.
  - **Impact:** NTLM Hash Disclosure.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions "**Spoofing Vulnerability**". The Retriever Results also list CWE-290 (Authentication Bypass by Spoofing) as a relevant CWE. While the CVE Reference Links Content Summary is unavailable, the direct mention of "spoofing" in the vulnerability description makes CWE-290 the most appropriate choice. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-290 is a specific type of authentication bypass, fitting well within the broader context of authentication-related weaknesses. My assessment is based on limited evidence, but the key phrase "Spoofing Vulnerability" strongly suggests CWE-290.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product communicates with a host that provides a certificate, but the product does not properly ensure that the certificate is actually associated with that host.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
This attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-289: Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs authentication based on the name of a resource being accessed, or the name of the actor performing the access, but it does not properly check all possible names for that resource or actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-358: Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard
