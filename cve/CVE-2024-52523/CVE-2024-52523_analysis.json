  "description": "Nextcloud Server is a self hosted personal cloud system. After setting up a user or administrator defined external storage with fixed credentials, the API returns them and adds them into the frontend again, allowing to read them in plain text when an attacker already has access to an active session of a user. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 28.0.12, 29.0.9 or 30.0.2 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 25.0.13.14, 26.0.13.10, 27.1.11.10, 28.0.12, 29.0.9 or 30.0.2.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the fact that when a user or administrator sets up an external storage with fixed credentials (e.g., password), the API incorrectly returns these credentials and includes them in the frontend. This exposes sensitive information that should not be accessible on the client side.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of sensitive credentials (passwords) in plain text via the API response. This is a classic example of exposing sensitive information.\n- **Lack of Proper Handling of Sensitive Data:** The system does not properly handle the storage and transmission of sensitive data. The password should not be directly returned via API or displayed in the frontend.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- An attacker who has already gained access to an active user session can read the plaintext credentials of external storages.\n- This could lead to further compromise, as the attacker can use the exposed passwords to access the external storages, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized modifications.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The attack vector is primarily network-based, exploiting the API to retrieve the sensitive data. \n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- An attacker needs to have access to an active session of a legitimate user or administrator. This implies the attacker has already compromised the user session, possibly via social engineering, session hijacking, or other attacks.\n- The attacker would need the ability to interact with the Nextcloud API to retrieve the exposed credentials.\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n- The fix for this vulnerability involves setting the password parameter as \"sensitive\" in the code. This prevents the password from being included in API responses.\n- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Nextcloud Server and Nextcloud Enterprise Server, with specific patch versions mentioned.\n- The issue was reported by the Bundesamt f\u00fcr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) and mgm-sp.\n\nThe provided content clearly relates to CVE-2024-52523, detailing the vulnerability, its impact, and the fix applied.",

The vulnerability involves:\n  - Transmission of sensitive data (credentials) in cleartext (CWE-319)\n  - A contributing factor is the storage of such credentials in a manner that allows retrieval in plaintext (CWE-312).\n  - The credentials being included in data being sent (CWE-201).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n\n    cwe319 --> cwe312\n    cwe312 --> cwe201\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe312,cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events leading to the vulnerability is as follows:\n  1. External storage configured with fixed credentials.\n  2. API incorrectly returns these credentials in plain text.\n  3. Frontend receives and exposes these credentials due to **lack of proper handling of sensitive data**.\n  4. Attacker with access to a user session views the credentials.\n\nRoot cause: Incorrect API response including credentials.\nImpact: Credentials exposed leading to potential compromise of external storage.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the subsequent weaknesses. The primary weakness is the transmission of credentials in cleartext. Supporting this is the storage of credentials in a way that allows their retrieval in plain text. The graph relationships helped frame the analysis, showing how the weaknesses are related. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE details strongly supports the selection of CWE-319 as the primary CWE. The decision is further reinforced by the fact that the fix involves marking the password parameter as \"sensitive,\" which directly relates to preventing its transmission.\n\nThe selection of CWE-319 as the primary is based on the following evidence:\n- \"API returns them and adds them into the frontend again, allowing to read them in plain text\"\n- \"The vulnerability stems from the fact that when a user or administrator sets up an external storage with fixed credentials (e.g., password), the API incorrectly returns these credentials and includes them in the frontend\"\n\nCWE-319 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the transmission of sensitive information in cleartext, which is the core issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25
