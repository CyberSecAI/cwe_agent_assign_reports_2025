## Vulnerability Description
RE11S v1.11 was discovered to contain a **stack overflow** via the rootAPmac parameter in the formStaDrvSetup function.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack overflow**
- **product:** RE11S
- **version:** v1.11
- **component:** formStaDrvSetup function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```text
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is a stack overflow in the `formStaDrvSetup` function within the webs file of the RE11S_1.11 router. It's triggered by the `rootAPmac` key value using `sprintf`.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Stack overflow vulnerability

Impact of exploitation:
The stack overflow allows overwriting stack space, as demonstrated by overflowing from 0x3c8 to 0x3ec. The extent of overflow can be controlled by modifying the `rootAPmac` key value.

Attack vectors:
- Sending a crafted POST request to `http://192.168.9.2/goform/formStaDrvSetup` with a long string as the value for the `rootAPmac` parameter.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Network access to the router at `http://192.168.9.2`.
- Ability to send HTTP POST requests.

Mitigation or fix:
The content does not provide information about mitigation or a fix.

Additional details:
- The provided PoC (Proof of Concept) uses a Python script (`poc.py`) to exploit the vulnerability.
- The repository includes instructions on how to simulate the router using `firmAE` and the command `sudo ./run.sh -r v1 ~/IOT/RE11S_1.11/RE11S_1.11.bin`.
- The vulnerability was discovered during an internship at Qi An Xin Tiangong Lab.
