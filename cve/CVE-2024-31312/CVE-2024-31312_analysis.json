Since the description explicitly mentions a **missing permission check**, CWE-862, which is a child of CWE-863, was deemed more appropriate. CWE-223 was selected as a secondary weakness, as it relates to the omission of security-relevant information, which in this case is that the media visibility on the lock screen did not properly follow the notification settings.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe223[\"CWE-223: Omission of Security-relevant Information\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe223 -->|RELATED| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe223 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing permission check** (CWE-862), leading to local information disclosure by exposing played media (CWE-223).

The vulnerability description clearly states a **missing permission check**, which aligns directly with the definition of CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). The high retriever score for CWE-862 and the explicit mention of \"missing permission check\" in the vulnerability description solidified this choice. The CWE Classification Guidance also suggests CWE-862 when authorization logic is completely missing.\n\nCWE-223 was added as a secondary weakness because exposing played media can be classified as omitting security-relevant information on the lock screen.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly represents the **missing authorization** check, rather than a more general authorization issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
