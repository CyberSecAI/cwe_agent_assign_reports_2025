# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-57432
## Query
macrozheng mall-tiny 1.0.1 suffers from Insecure Permissions. The applications JWT signing keys are hardcoded and do not change. User information is explicitly written into the JWT and used for subsequent privilege management, making it is possible to forge the JWT of any user to achieve authentication bypass.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'JWT signing keys are hardcoded', 'do not change'
- **weakness**: 'Insecure Permissions'
