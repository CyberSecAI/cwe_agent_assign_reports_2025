This more specific variant is preferred. While CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is related to authentication bypass, the root cause is the hardcoded key, making CWE-321 more appropriate as the primary CWE.

This directly corresponds to CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key). The resulting authentication bypass is a consequence of this weakness, supporting CWE-287 as a secondary consideration. The selection of CWE-321 is based on its specific match to the root cause. The evidence is strong, and the CWE is at the appropriate level of specificity (Variant).
