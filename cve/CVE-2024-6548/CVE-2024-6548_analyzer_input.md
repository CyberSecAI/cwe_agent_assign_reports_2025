# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-6548

## Vulnerability Description
The Add Admin JavaScript plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 2.0. This is due to the plugin **utilizing bootstrap and leaving test files with display_errors on**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **utilizing bootstrap and leaving test files with display_errors on**
- **impact:** Full Path Disclosure
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **product:** Add Admin WordPress plugin
- **version:** up to and including 2.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6548:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the "Add Admin JavaScript" plugin for WordPress utilizing a `bootstrap.php` test file which has `display_errors` set to 'on'. This setting causes PHP to output errors and warnings, including the full server path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Full Path Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the full server path of the web application. This is due to the `display_errors` setting in the `bootstrap.php` file combined with an error that triggers path disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can learn the server's absolute file path, which can be a crucial piece of information for further attacks.
*   **Aiding Further Exploitation:** The path disclosure does not have a direct impact itself. It can be used to aid in exploiting other vulnerabilities and potentially lead to more severe attacks. As the Wordfence article states, the information displayed is not useful on its own and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can be remote.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Basic Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected web server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the Add Admin JavaScript plugin up to and including version 2.0.
*   There is currently no known patch for the vulnerability, and the recommendation is to either uninstall the plugin or implement mitigation strategies, based on the organization's risk tolerance.
*   The identified vulnerable code is in a test file (`bootstrap.php`) that should not be accessible to the public, however the vulnerability exists due to the presence of the file and the `display_errors` setting.
