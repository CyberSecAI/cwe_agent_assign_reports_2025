  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-40642', description='The netty incubator codec.bhttp is a java language binary http parser. In affected versions the `BinaryHttpParser` class does not properly validate input values thus giving attackers almost complete control over the HTTP requests constructed from the parsed output. Attackers can abuse several issues individually to perform various injection attacks including **HTTP request smuggling**, desync attacks, HTTP **header injections**, request queue poisoning, caching attacks and Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). Attacker could also combine several issues to create well-formed messages for other text-based protocols which may result in attacks beyond the HTTP protocol. The BinaryHttpParser class implements the readRequestHead method which performs most of the relevant parsing of the received request. The data structure prefixes values with a variable length integer value. The parsing code below first gets the lengths of the values from the prefixed variable length integer. After it has all of the lengths and calculates all of the indices, the parser casts the applicable slices of the ByteBuf to String. Finally, it passes these values into a new `DefaultBinaryHttpRequest` object where no further parsing or validation occurs. Method is partially validated while other values are not validated at all. Software that relies on netty to apply input validation for binary HTTP data may be vulnerable to various injection and protocol based attacks. This issue has been addressed in version 0.0.13.Fi', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'improper input validation', 'weakness': ['HTTP request smuggling', 'header injections'], 'impact': ['HTTP header injections', 'caching attacks', 'desync attacks', 'request queue poisoning', 'server side request forgery'], 'vector': '', 'attacker': 'attackers', 'product': 'netty incubator codec.bhttp', 'version': 'before 0.0.13', 'component': 'BinaryHttpParser class'}, reference_content='Based on the provided information, here\\'s a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-40642:\\n\\n**Root Cause:**\\nThe `BinaryHttpParser` in netty-incubator-codec-ohttp does not properly validate input values when parsing binary HTTP requests. Specifically, it fails to validate the path, authority, and scheme components of the request.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\\n- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The parser relies on variable-length integers to determine the length of various parts of the HTTP request (method, scheme, authority, path). However, after extracting these lengths and casting the corresponding byte slices to Strings, no further validation is performed before using them.\\n- **Lack of sanitization:** The extracted strings are passed directly to the `DefaultBinaryHttpRequest` constructor without checking for invalid or malicious characters.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n- **Injection Attacks:** Attackers can inject malicious content into the HTTP request, including HTTP request smuggling, desync attacks, HTTP header injections, request queue poisoning, caching attacks, and Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF).\\n- **Protocol Confusion:** By crafting specific messages, attackers might be able to create well-formed messages for other text-based protocols, potentially leading to attacks beyond the HTTP protocol.\\n- **Arbitrary Method:** The request method is only partially validated, allowing arbitrary HTTP verbs. While it\\'s not a complete injection vector on its own, it can be used in conjunction with other unvalidated fields to construct malicious messages.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- **Maliciously Crafted Binary HTTP Requests:** An attacker can create a specially crafted binary HTTP request containing malicious content in the path, authority, or scheme fields.\\n- **Network Interception:** An attacker can intercept and modify binary HTTP requests in transit to inject malicious payloads.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- **Ability to send binary HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send a binary HTTP request that can be parsed by the vulnerable `BinaryHttpParser`.\\n- **Knowledge of Binary HTTP Format:** The attacker needs to know how to encode malicious payloads using the variable-length integer encoding used by the `BinaryHttpParser`.\\n\\n**Additional Details from the provided content:**\\n- The provided content includes the fix, where the `BinaryHttpParser` was modified to add validation for the method, scheme, authority and path using `TOKEN_VALIDATOR` and `SCHEME_VALIDATOR` ByteProcessors.\\n-  The commit message states \"No injection possible anymore\" after the fix.\\n- Unit tests were added to check for invalid chars in method, scheme, authority and path, including whitespace.\\n\\nThis analysis provides more detail than the initial CVE description, explaining the vulnerability\\'s mechanics and potential impact.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [],

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    The netty incubator codec.bhttp is a java language binary http parser. In affected versions the `BinaryHttpParser` class does not properly validate input values thus giving attackers almost complete control over the HTTP requests constructed from the parsed output. Attackers can abuse several issues individually to perform various injection attacks including **HTTP request smuggling**, desync attacks, HTTP **header injections**, request queue poisoning, caching attacks and Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). Attacker could also combine several issues to create well-formed messages for other text-based protocols which may result in attacks beyond the HTTP protocol. The BinaryHttpParser class implements the readRequestHead method which performs most of the relevant parsing of the received request. The data structure prefixes values with a variable length integer value. The parsing code below first gets the lengths of the values from the prefixed variable length integer. After it has all of the lengths and calculates all of the indices, the parser casts the applicable slices of the ByteBuf to String. Finally, it passes these values into a new `DefaultBinaryHttpRequest` object where no further parsing or validation occurs. Method is partially validated while other values are not validated at all. Software that relies on netty to apply input validation for binary HTTP data may be vulnerable to various injection and protocol based attacks. This issue has been addressed in version 0.0.13.Fi\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'improper input validation'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
