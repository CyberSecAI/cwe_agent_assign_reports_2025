The content explicitly mentions CVE-2025-0650 and describes the vulnerability.\n\n**2.  Extracted Information:**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**\n    *   The vulnerability arises due to the interaction between OVN's DNS caching feature and egress ACL rules. Specifically, the OpenFlow rules installed by OVN, when DNS caching is enabled, allow specially crafted UDP packets to bypass egress ACL rules.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    *   Egress ACL bypass.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:**\n    *   Unauthorized access to virtual machines and containers running on the OVN network.\n*   **Attack vectors:**\n    *   Crafting a UDP packet to bypass egress ACL rules.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n    *   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted UDP packets.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:**\n    *   **Mitigation:**\n        *   Disable DNS caching in OVN by clearing the \"dns\\_records\" column of all logical switches.\n        *   Adjust ACLs from being evaluated on egress (\"to-lport\") to being evaluated on ingress (\"from-lport\").\n        *   Adjust the topology of the virtual network so that DNS caching and egress ACLs are not on the same logical switch.\n    *   **Fix:**\n        *   Apply patches provided for specific OVN versions (22.03.x, 24.03.x, 24.09.x).\n        *   Upgrade to a known patched version of OVN (v22.03.8, v24.03.5, v24.09.2).\n\n**3.

CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel is a base CWE and a child of CWE-923. CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization is a class-level CWE, and CWE-942 is a child of both CWE-923 and CWE-863. The vulnerability involves bypassing egress access control lists (ACLs), indicating a failure to properly restrict the communication channel. The relationship between CWE-923 and its child CWE-941 indicates that the destination is incorrectly specified, contributing to the bypass.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe923[\"CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\"]\n    cwe941[\"CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe942[\"CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains\"]\n    \n    cwe941 -->|CHILDOF| cwe923\n    cwe942 -->|CHILDOF| cwe923\n    cwe942 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe923 primary\n    class cwe941,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **specially crafted UDP packets** that **bypass egress access control lists (ACLs)** due to **improper restriction of the communication channel**. This leads to **unauthorized access to virtual machines and containers**.\n\n*   **Root Cause:** Improper restriction of the communication channel (CWE-923) due to interaction between DNS caching and egress ACLs.\n*   **Weakness:** Egress ACL bypass\n*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to virtual machines and containers.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on the description of the vulnerability, which involves bypassing egress access control lists (ACLs) with specially crafted UDP packets. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary provided detailed information about the root cause, confirming that the vulnerability arises due to the interaction between OVN's DNS caching and egress ACL rules. The primary CWE selected is CWE-923 because it directly addresses the **improper restriction of the communication channel**, which is the core weakness. CWE-941 is considered a secondary CWE as it is a child of CWE-923 and describes an **incorrectly specified destination**, contributing to the bypass. While the vulnerability also leads to unauthorized access, the root cause is not a direct authorization issue but rather a flaw in how the communication channel is restricted. CWE-863 is a weak secondary candidate as the ACL bypass leads to **incorrect authorization**.\n\nThe CWE classifications are based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The relationships between the CWEs, particularly the child-parent relationship between CWE-923 and CWE-941, influenced the selection by providing a more specific understanding of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used**: This CWE relates to the exposure of sensitive information, which is not the primary issue in this vulnerability.

For example, because UDP is a connectionless protocol, UDP packets can be spoofed by specifying a false source address in the packet; when the server receives the packet and sends a reply, it will specify a destination by using the source of the incoming packet - i.e., the false source. The server can then be tricked into sending traffic to the wrong host, which is effective for hiding the real source of an attack and for conducting a distributed denial of service (DDoS). As another example, server-side request forgery (SSRF) and XML External Entity (XXE) can be used to trick a server into making outgoing requests to hosts that cannot be directly accessed by the attacker due to firewall restrictions.\n\n  - If the product incorrectly specifies the destination, then an attacker who can control this destination might be able to spoof trusted servers. While the most common occurrence is likely due to misconfiguration by an administrator, this can be resultant from other weaknesses. For example, the product might incorrectly parse an e-mail or IP address and send sensitive data to an unintended destination. As another example, an Android application may use a \"sticky broadcast\" to communicate with a receiver for a particular application, but since sticky broadcasts can be processed by *any* receiver, this can allow a malicious application to access restricted data that was only intended for a different application.\n\n",
