Similar issue has been fixed for the primary hart, see c7cdd96eca28 (riscv prevent stack corruption by reserving task_pt_regs(p) early). However that fix was not propagated to the secondary harts. The problem has been noticed in some CPU hotplug tests with V enabled. The function smp_callin stored several registers on stack, corrupting top of pt_regs structure including status field. As a result, kernel attempted to save or restore inexistent V context. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-1284 CWE-457 CWE-667 CWE-1262 CWE-1256 CWE-1342 CWE-674 CWE-362 CWE-1260 CWE-1274",
