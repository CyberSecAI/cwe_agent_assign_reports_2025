# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-38195

## Vulnerability Description
Azure CycleCloud Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of user-supplied data during the creation of Azure CycleCloud cluster templates, specifically within the 'template' parameter.**
- **weakness:** **Insufficient input sanitization and validation, allowing for the injection of malicious code within template parameters that are later interpreted by the CycleCloud system.**
- **impact:** Successful exploitation leads to remote code execution on the target Azure CycleCloud server, potentially allowing an attacker to gain full control over the system, including data exfiltration or further compromise of the Azure environment.
- **vector:** The attack vector is through the submission of a crafted request to the CycleCloud API that contains malicious code within the template parameter.
- **attacker:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability if they can reach the CycleCloud API.
- **product:** Azure CycleCloud
- **version:** All versions prior to the patched version. (Please specify the patched version if known)
- **component:** Cluster template creation
