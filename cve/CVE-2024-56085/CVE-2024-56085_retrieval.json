Authenticated users can **inject payloads** while creating Search Template Dashboard. These are executed, leading to **Server-Side Template Injection**.', key_phrases={'rootcause': '', 'weakness': ['Server-Side Template Injection', 'inject payloads'], 'impact': 'server-side template injection', 'vector': '', 'attacker': 'authenticated users', 'product': 'Logpoint', 'version': 'before 7.5.0', 'component': 'Search Template Dashboard creation'}, reference_content='Based on the provided content, here\\'s a breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**Root Cause:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-provided input when creating Search Template Dashboards. This allows malicious users to inject template syntax that is then processed by the server.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\\n*   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):**  The core vulnerability is the ability to inject code into a server-side template. This is due to the application\\'s failure to treat user-provided data as untrusted when constructing the template.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n*   **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of SSTI can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.\\n*   **Data Breach/Information Disclosure:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive information, modify data, or cause denial of service. The CVSS vector specifies:\\n    *   **VC:H (Confidentiality Impact: High):** Significant unauthorized access to confidential data.\\n    *   **VI:L (Integrity Impact: Low):** Limited alterations to data by an unauthorized party.\\n    *  **VA:L (Availability Impact: Low):** Limited disruption of services.\\n    * **SC:L (Scope Change: Low):** A successful attack would have limited impact beyond the compromised application\\n    * **SI:L (Subsequent access impact: Low):** The attack has a limited impact on resources\\n    * **SA:L (System access impact: Low):** Limited ability to modify the systems resource\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n*   **Search Template Dashboard Creation:** The attack vector is specifically through the process of creating a \"Search Template Dashboard\".\\n*   **Payload Injection:** Attackers inject malicious code within the template creation process.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Logpoint platform.\\n*   **Access to Search Template Dashboard Creation:** The attacker needs access to the feature for creating a \"Search Template Dashboard\" to inject malicious content.\\n* **Low Privileges**: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability even with low privileges.\\n\\n**Additional Notes**\\n\\n*   The vulnerability is identified as CWE-1336, which is \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Template Engine\".\\n*   The issue is present in Logpoint versions prior to 7.5.0.\\n*   The vendor has provided a solution to mitigate this vulnerability by upgrading to version 7.5.0.\\n*   The CVSS v4.0 score is 5.9, which is rated as medium severity.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {95: {'cwe_counts': defaultdict(<class 'int'>,
