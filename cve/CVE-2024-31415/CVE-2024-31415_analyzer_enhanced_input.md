## Vulnerability Description
The Eaton Foreseer software provides the feasibility for the user to configure external servers for multiple purposes such as network management, user management, etc. The software uses encryption to store these configurations securely on the host machine. However, the keys used for this encryption were insecurely stored, which could be abused to possibly change or remove the server configuration.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insecurely stored encryption keys**
- **impact:** change or remove server configuration
- **product:** Eaton Foreseer software

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The keys used for encrypting server configurations were insecurely stored on the host machine.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficiently Protected Credentials (CWE-522).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers could potentially change or remove the server configuration.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the host machine is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs high privileges (PR:H) and local access to the host machine where Foreseer is installed.
