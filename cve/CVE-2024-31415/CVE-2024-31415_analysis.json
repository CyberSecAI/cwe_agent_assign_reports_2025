CWE-312 and CWE-522 are also related as potential consequences of the insecure storage. The selection of CWE-321 as the primary weakness is influenced by its specificity and direct relevance to the **root cause**, which is the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe321 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe312\n    cwe321 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe522\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe798,cwe312,cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure storage of encryption keys** (CWE-321). This can lead to **cleartext storage of sensitive information** (CWE-312) if the keys are directly accessible. It also results in **insufficient protection of credentials** (CWE-522) because the encryption keys, which are a form of credential, are not adequately secured. The final impact is the ability to change or remove server configurations.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, which indicates that the encryption keys were **insecurely stored**.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) because the vulnerability description mentions that the keys used for encryption were **insecurely stored**. This aligns with the definition of CWE-321, which focuses on the risks associated with using hard-coded cryptographic keys. This is the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is considered because the keys were not properly protected. CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is considered because the encryption keys were **insecurely stored**, which directly relates to insufficient protection of these credentials.\n\nThe selection of CWE-321 is based on the fact that it accurately represents the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the use of **insecurely stored encryption keys**. The abstraction level (Variant) is appropriate because it provides a specific characterization of the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\nCWE-1391 isn't suitable because the keys are not described as weak in the sense of being easily guessed, but rather **insecurely stored**.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
