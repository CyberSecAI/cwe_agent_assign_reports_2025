This vulnerability is due to **weak entropy** for handlers that are used during the VPN authentication process as well as a **race condition** that exists in the same process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by correctly guessing an authentication handler and then sending crafted HTTPS requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to take over the AnyConnect VPN session from a target user or prevent the target user from establishing an AnyConnect VPN session with the affected device.', key_phrases={'rootcause': ['weak entropy', 'race condition'], 'weakness': '', 'impact': ['hijack AnyConnect VPN session', 'denial of service (DoS)'], 'vector': 'crafted HTTPS requests', 'attacker': 'unauthenticated remote attacker', 'product': ['Cisco Meraki MX', 'Cisco Meraki Z Series Teleworker Gateway devices'], 'version': '', 'component': 'Cisco AnyConnect VPN server'}, reference_content='- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to weak entropy for handlers used during the VPN authentication process and a race condition within the same process.\\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:\\n    - Weak entropy in authentication handlers.\\n    - Race condition in the VPN authentication process.\\n- **Impact of exploitation**:\\n    - An attacker can hijack an existing AnyConnect VPN session from a target user.\\n    - An attacker can prevent a target user from establishing an AnyConnect VPN session, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\\n- **Attack vectors**:\\n    - Remote attack via crafted HTTPS requests.\\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:\\n    - Unauthenticated remote attacker.\\n    - The attacker must be able to correctly guess an authentication handler.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '367', 'name': 'Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': \"The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    A vulnerability in the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server of Cisco Meraki MX and Cisco Meraki Z Series Teleworker Gateway devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to hijack an AnyConnect VPN session or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition for individual users of the AnyConnect VPN service on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to **weak entropy** for handlers that are used during the VPN authentication process as well as a **race condition** that exists in the same process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by correctly guessing an authentication handler and then sending crafted HTTPS requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to take over the AnyConnect VPN session from a target user or prevent the target user from establishing an AnyConnect VPN session with the affected device.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'weak entropy'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.

CWE-20: Improper Input Validation (Score: 816.71)\n\nThe product receives input or data, but it does\n        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the\n        properties that are required to process the data safely and\n        correctly....\n\n### 4. CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (Score: 809.64)\n\nThe product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources....\n\n### 5. CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime (Score: 280.20)\n\nThe product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory....\n\n## COMPONENT: 'Cisco AnyConnect VPN server'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this COMPONENT:\n\n### 1. CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition (Score: 841.42)\n\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state....\n\n### 2. CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element (Score: 821.41)\n\nThe product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors....\n\n### 3.

CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm (Score: 806.82)\n\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect....\n\n\n    # Analysis Instructions\n    1. For each keyphrase, identify the most appropriate CWE(s) that represent the weakness.\n    2. Consider how the different keyphrases might relate to each other in the vulnerability chain.\n    3. Provide a final determination of primary CWE(s) and any secondary CWEs.\n    4. Format your response using the standard analysis template.\n\n    Please analyze how these different weaknesses interact and provide a comprehensive CWE classification.\n    "
