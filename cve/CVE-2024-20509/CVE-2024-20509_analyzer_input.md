# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-20509

# Vulnerability Description

    A vulnerability in the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server of Cisco Meraki MX and Cisco Meraki Z Series Teleworker Gateway devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to hijack an AnyConnect VPN session or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition for individual users of the AnyConnect VPN service on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to **weak entropy** for handlers that are used during the VPN authentication process as well as a **race condition** that exists in the same process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by correctly guessing an authentication handler and then sending crafted HTTPS requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to take over the AnyConnect VPN session from a target user or prevent the target user from establishing an AnyConnect VPN session with the affected device.

    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis
    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. 
    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.

    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'weak entropy'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition (Score: 841.42)

The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state....

### 2. CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element (Score: 821.41)

The product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors....

### 3. CWE-20: Improper Input Validation (Score: 816.71)

The product receives input or data, but it does
        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the
        properties that are required to process the data safely and
        correctly....

### 4. CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm (Score: 806.82)

The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect....
