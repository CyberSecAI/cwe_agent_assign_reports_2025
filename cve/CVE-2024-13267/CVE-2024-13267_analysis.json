CWE-96, which refers to the improper neutralization of directives in statically saved code, can be considered a related weakness, possibly preceding the file inclusion. CWE-98 is in the chain CANFOLLOW -> CWE-73, CANFOLLOW -> CWE-473, CANFOLLOW -> CWE-456, CANFOLLOW -> CWE-425, CANFOLLOW -> CWE-184\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe98[\"CWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion')\"]\n    cwe96[\"CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    cwe473[\"CWE-473: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    cwe456[\"CWE-456: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    cwe184[\"CWE-184: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n\n    cwe98 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe73\n    cwe98 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe473\n    cwe98 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe456\n    cwe98 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe425\n    cwe98 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe184\n    cwe96 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe98\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe98 primary\n    class cwe96 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code (Static Code Injection)** (CWE-96), which leads to **PHP Local File Inclusion** (CWE-98) due to the **improper control of the filename** used in include/require statements. The **root cause** is the **lack of proper input validation** or sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate the filename and include arbitrary files.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly points to a **PHP Local File Inclusion** issue. The phrase \"**PHP Local File Inclusion**\" strongly suggests CWE-98. The reference to \"**Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code (Static Code Injection)**\" indicates that static code injection may contribute to the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-98, Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion'), is selected as the primary CWE because the description explicitly mentions \"PHP Local File Inclusion\". This aligns perfectly with the CWE's focus on the **improper control of filenames** used in PHP include/require statements, leading to the inclusion of unintended files.\n\nCWE-96, Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection'), is considered a secondary CWE because the description includes \"**Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code (Static Code Injection)**\". This suggests that the vulnerability may involve the injection of code directives into statically saved code, which then leads to the file inclusion vulnerability.\n\nThe selection is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description, which directly mentions both \"PHP Local File Inclusion\" and \"**Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code (Static Code Injection)**\". The retriever results also support this selection, with CWE-98 being the top result.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g. \"eval\").\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
