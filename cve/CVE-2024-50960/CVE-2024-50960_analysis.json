This endpoint is intended for network diagnostics.\n    *   **Root Cause:** Improper input validation in the `/nmap/test` endpoint, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary commands.\n    *   **Authentication Required:** Yes, web admin credentials are required.\n    *   **Impact:**\n        *   Full system compromise.\n        *   Privilege escalation (root privileges).\n        *   Persistent access.\n        *   Potential for lateral movement and network-wide attacks.\n    *   **Example Exploitation:**  The attacker modifies the \"host\" field in a PUT request to the `/api/swis/resources` endpoint, injecting a command like `127.0.0.1 `id`` to execute the `id` command.  A follow-up GET request retrieves the results, revealing the output of the injected command. A Netcat bind shell example `127.0.0.1 `nc -nlvp 4444 -e /bin/sh`` is provided.\n    *   **Mitigation/Protection:**\n        *   Enforce strong, unique authentication credentials.\n        *   Network isolation of the device.\n        *   Apply firmware updates.\n    *   **Additional Details:** The content provides a Python-based proof-of-concept tool to automate command injection and curl commands for exploitation. The advisory highlights the risk of default and blank passwords.\n    *   **Vendor Response:** Extron has acknowledged the vulnerability, and newer firmware versions have removed the problematic nmap functionality.\n\n*   Content from `github.com_3fc280a2_20250625_031544.html`:\n\n    *   **Content:** A GitHub repository for a tool to exploit OS command injection vulnerabilities in Extron SMP devices. This directly relates to CVE-2024-50960.\n    *   **Details:** The repository contains a Python script (`extron_smp_inject.py`) designed to exploit the vulnerability. It specifies the actions: `command`, `bind`, and `reverse` shell. It provides example commands. The tool requires `rhost`, `rport`, username, and password.\n\n*   Content from `www.extron.com_d8dbdc9d_20250625_043008.html`:\n\n    *   **Content:** This page is for Extron SME 211 Streaming Media Encoder. This product has been confirmed to be vulnerable to the OS command injection, CVE-2024-50960, in the related advisory.\n\n*   Content from `www.extron.com_21027efc_20250625_031548.html`:\n\n    *   **Content:** This is a product page for Extron SMP series streaming media processors.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe provided content contains detailed information about CVE-2024-50960, including affected devices (Extron SMP 111, SMP 351, SMP 352, and SME 211), the root cause (improper input validation), attack vector (the `/nmap/test` endpoint), impact (full system compromise, privilege escalation), and mitigation strategies (strong authentication, network isolation, firmware updates). It also offers a proof-of-concept tool and curl commands for exploitation. The information is consistent with the official CVE description and adds significant detail about the vulnerability and its exploitation.",

Since the vulnerability specifically involves OS commands, CWE-78 is the more specific and appropriate choice. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a more general weakness that can lead to many different vulnerabilities, including command injection. It is included as a secondary weakness because the root cause involves **improper validation** of the input.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe78 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper input validation** (CWE-20) of the \"host\" field in the `/nmap/test` endpoint. This leads to the **command injection** (CWE-78), allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root on the underlying operating system. The final impact is full system compromise and privilege escalation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')). The vulnerability description clearly states that there is a \"**command injection**\" vulnerability, and the CVE reference confirms that the attack vector involves injecting arbitrary commands into the `/nmap/test` endpoint, leading to OS command execution. The evidence is strong, with the CVE reference providing detailed information about the root cause and exploitation. The retriever results also list CWE-78 as a top candidate.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"A **command injection** vulnerability in the Nmap diagnostic tool...allows a remote authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root on the underlying operating system.\"\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"Improper input validation in the `/nmap/test` endpoint, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary commands.\"\n\nCWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')) was considered but not selected as the primary CWE because CWE-78 is more specific, referring to OS commands. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) was considered as a secondary CWE because the root cause involves improper input validation.\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-78 being a Base level CWE and CWE-20 being a Class level CWE, which covers the more general weakness of input validation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*CWE-74 was considered but not selected as CWE-78 is more specific.*\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*CWE-497 was not selected as it is not related to the root cause of command injection.*\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*CWE-78 was selected as the primary CWE.*\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
