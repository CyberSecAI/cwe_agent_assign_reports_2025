  "description": "A vulnerability in the Remote Access VPN feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to **improper validation of client key data** after the TLS session is established. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted key value to an affected system over the secure TLS session. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.",

This allows for the possibility of sending a crafted key value to trigger the vulnerability.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can cause the affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\n- **Attack vectors:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted key value to the affected system over an established secure TLS session.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the capability to send crafted data over a TLS session to the vulnerable device. No prior authentication is required.",

While the vulnerability description points to **improper validation of client key data**, it does not specify the exact nature of the **improper validation**. CWE-20, as a class, is a general category for input validation issues. The retriever results also suggested CWE-755, Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions. Since a crafted key value causes a device reload, the device can be said to have an improper handling of the exceptional condition. However, the root cause is still the input validation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe755[\"CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n\n    cwe755 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe755 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper validation of client key data** (CWE-20). An attacker sends a crafted key value, which the system fails to validate properly. This leads to a device reload, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\n- **Root Cause:** CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)\n- **Impact:** Denial of Service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the primary weakness is CWE-20, **Improper Input Validation**, because the **improper validation of client key data** is the root cause of the vulnerability. The evidence to support this is found in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section.\nThe secondary weakness that was considered was CWE-755, **Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions**, since the crafted key value causes a device reload. However, the root cause is still the input validation and not exception handling.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
