# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-20495

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the Remote Access VPN feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to **improper validation of client key data** after the TLS session is established. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted key value to an affected system over the secure TLS session. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper validation of client key data**
- **impact:** denial of service (DoS)
- **vector:** crafted key value
- **attacker:** unauthenticated remote attacker
- **product:** Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software
- **component:** Remote Access VPN feature

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of client key data after the TLS session is established in the Remote Access VPN feature of Cisco ASA and FTD software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from inadequate validation of client key data after the TLS session is established. This allows for the possibility of sending a crafted key value to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can cause the affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted key value to the affected system over an established secure TLS session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the capability to send crafted data over a TLS session to the vulnerable device. No prior authentication is required.
