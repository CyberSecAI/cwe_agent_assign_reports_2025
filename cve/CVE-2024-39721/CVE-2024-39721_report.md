# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-39721

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-39721

## Description

An issue was discovered in Ollama before 0.1.34. The CreateModelHandler function uses os.Open to read a file until completion. The req.Path parameter is user-controlled and can be set to /dev/random, which is blocking, causing the goroutine to run infinitely (even after the HTTP request is aborted by the client).

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Impact:** infinite goroutine loop
- **Vector:** user-controlled req.Path parameter
- **Product:** Ollama
- **Version:** before 0.1.34
- **Component:** CreateModelHandler function

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-770 | Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Allowed |
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.6 | Class | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-770, which is a base-level CWE describing allocation of resources without limits or throttling. This is directly related to the **root cause** of the vulnerability, where the application **allocates resources** (goroutine) based on **user-controlled input** without proper validation, eventually leading to **resource exhaustion**. CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption), which describes the high-level impact of the vulnerability. CWE-20 is also related since the **user-controlled input** isn't validated.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **lack of input validation** (CWE-20) on the `req.Path` parameter, which allows a user to specify `/dev/random` as the file to be opened. The application then **allocates a resource** (goroutine) to read this file without any limits or throttling (CWE-770). Since `/dev/random` is a blocking device, the goroutine gets stuck in an infinite loop, leading to **uncontrolled resource consumption** and a denial-of-service (CWE-400).

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description and the CVE reference content summary. The description clearly states that the user-controlled `req.Path` parameter can be set to `/dev/random`, which causes a goroutine to run infinitely. This behavior aligns directly with CWE-770, "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling", as the application allocates a goroutine without limiting the time.

The relationship graph influenced the decision to include CWE-400, as it represents the broader impact of the vulnerability. CWE-20 was added to represent the missing input validation.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as CWE-770 captures the **root cause** of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.65
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.65
