  "description": "An issue was discovered on the Forvia Hella HELLA Driving Recorder DR 820. Remotely Dumping of Video Footage and the Live Video Stream can occur. It allows remote attackers to access and download recorded video footage from the SD card via port 9091. Additionally, attackers can connect to port 9092 to stream the live video feed by bypassing the challenge-response authentication mechanism. This exposes sensitive location and personal data.",

It provides significantly more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the ability to remotely dump video footage and live video streams from the HELLA 820 dashcam once connected and authenticated.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Lack of secure access controls after authentication.\n*   Exposure of video recordings and live streams via ports 9091 and 9092.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized access to sensitive video footage, including location data.\n*   Ability to dump live video stream.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Remote access to the dashcam via ports 9091 and 9092 after successful authentication (likely leveraging vulnerabilities described in other CVEs like CVE-2025-30113 and CVE-2025-30115).\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Network access to the dashcam.\n*   Successful authentication to the dashcam (requires exploiting other vulnerabilities to bypass authentication or obtain valid credentials).\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not specify a mitigation or fix.",

The vulnerability description clearly states the ability to bypass the challenge-response authentication mechanism to access sensitive data.\n\nThe selection of CWE-306 as the primary CWE is based on the vulnerability description indicating that attackers can bypass the challenge-response authentication mechanism to stream live video. This indicates that the system **does not perform any authentication** for that functionality.\n\nThe retriever results also support this selection, with CWE-306 being a top match, along with CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). The mapping guidance also supports CWE-306 when no identity validation is enforced.\n\nCWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) is a valid secondary concern, as the primary issue involves an alternate channel (port 9092) that **does not properly implement authentication**.\n\nCWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere) is also a valid secondary concern as the **lack of proper access control** leads to exposure of sensitive location and personal data.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, providing a clear and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
