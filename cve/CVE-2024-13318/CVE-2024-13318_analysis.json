CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE, while CWE-425 is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-862. The vulnerability description indicates a **missing authorization** check, making CWE-862 a strong candidate. However, the fact that this allows unauthenticated access to delete pages and posts leans towards CWE-425 as a more specific, base-level representation of the weakness. Since CWE-862 is a class, it's preferred to go with the base, which in this case is CWE-425. However, the evidence points more directly to a missing authorization check in general rather than unauthorized access to specific URLs, scripts or files. Therefore CWE-862 is chosen as the primary.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **missing capability check** (CWE-862), which leads to unauthenticated attackers being able to delete arbitrary pages and posts.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly considered CWE-862 (**Missing Authorization**) due to the explicit mention of a \"**missing capability check**\". This directly aligns with the description of CWE-862, which states, \"The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\" Further consideration was given to CWE-425 (**Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')**) as a more specific base-level CWE related to authorization issues, since it is a child of CWE-862. The final decision favors CWE-862 as the primary because the description focuses more on the lack of an authorization check in general, rather than unauthorized access to specific URLs, scripts, or files. CWE-425 is noted as a secondary.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352:
