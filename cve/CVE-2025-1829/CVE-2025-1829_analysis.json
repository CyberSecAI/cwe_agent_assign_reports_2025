  "description": "A vulnerability was found in TOTOLINK X18 9.1.0cu.2024_B20220329. It has been declared as critical. This vulnerability affects the function setMtknatCfg of the file /cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi. The manipulation of the argument mtkhnatEnable leads to **os command injection**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
