  "query": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. This affects the function AssimpASEParserParseLV4MeshBonesVertices of the file code/AssetLib/ASE/ASEParser.cpp of the component ASE File Handler. The manipulation leads to heap-based buffer overflow. The attack needs to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier of the patch is e8a6286542924e628e02749c4f5ac4f91fdae71b. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.",
