  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpf Fix helper writes to read-only maps Lonial found an issue that despite user- and BPF-side frozen BPF map (like in case of .rodata), it was still possible to write into it from a BPF program side through specific helpers having ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} as arguments. In check_func_arg() when the argument is as mentioned, the meta->raw_mode is never set. Later, check_helper_mem_access(), under the case of PTR_TO_MAP_VALUE as register base type, it assumes BPF_READ for the subsequent call to check_map_access_type() and given the BPF map is read-only it succeeds. The helpers really need to be annotated as ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} | MEM_UNINIT when results are written into them as opposed to read out of them. The latter indicates that its okay to pass a pointer to **uninitialized memory** as the memory is written to anyway. However, ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} is a special case of ARG_PTR_TO_FIXED_SIZE_MEM just with additional alignment requirement. So it is better to just get rid of the ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} special cases altogether and reuse the fixed size memory types. For this, add MEM_ALIGNED to additionally ensure alignment given these helpers write directly into the args via * = val. The .arg*_size has been initialized reflecting the actual sizeof(*). MEM_ALIGNED can only be used in combination with MEM_FIXED_SIZE annotated argument types, since in !MEM_FIXED_SIZE cases the verifier does not know the b",

  "reference_content": "### CVE-2024-49861\n\nBased on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from an oversight in the BPF verifier regarding how it handles writes to read-only BPF maps via specific helper functions. These helper functions, when used with arguments of type `ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT}`, could bypass the intended read-only restrictions of a map.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Incorrect Argument Type Handling:** The `check_func_arg()` function failed to set the `meta->raw_mode` flag when encountering `ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT}` argument types. This flag is essential for indicating whether a memory region is uninitialized and subject to writes.\n*   **Flawed Memory Access Checks:**  The `check_helper_mem_access()` function incorrectly assumed `BPF_READ` access for `PTR_TO_MAP_VALUE` base types when checking memory access, due to the missing `meta->raw_mode` flag, leading to successful validation even when the map was read-only.\n*   **Bypass of Read-Only Restrictions:** The combination of the above weaknesses allowed BPF programs to write into BPF maps marked as read-only, violating memory safety and security invariants.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary Memory Modification:** Successful exploitation allows a malicious or compromised BPF program to modify the contents of read-only BPF maps, leading to arbitrary memory corruption.\n*   **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating data structures within the kernel, this vulnerability could be leveraged for privilege escalation.\n*   **Denial of Service:** Corrupting crucial kernel data structures can result in system instability and denial of service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Malicious BPF Programs:** Attackers can craft malicious BPF programs to exploit this vulnerability.\n*   **Compromised BPF Programs:** An attacker gaining control over an existing BPF program could exploit it.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Ability to load BPF programs:** An attacker needs the capability to load and execute BPF programs on the target system. This typically requires root privileges or specific capabilities that allow for BPF program loading.\n*   **Understanding of BPF and the vulnerability:** The attacker needs a solid grasp of BPF internals and the specifics of the described vulnerability.\n*   **Target system with vulnerable kernel:** The attacker needs to target a system running a kernel with the vulnerable code.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability affects specific helper functions that use `ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT}` arguments when writing to memory, instead of reading from it.\n*   The fix involves removing the special cases for `ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT}` and reusing `ARG_PTR_TO_FIXED_SIZE_MEM` with additional flags. `MEM_UNINIT` is used to indicate that the memory can be uninitialized, and `MEM_ALIGNED` ensures alignment for direct writes.\n*   The change includes updating function prototypes within `include/linux/bpf.h`, `kernel/bpf/helpers.c`, `kernel/bpf/syscall.c`, `kernel/bpf/verifier.c`, `kernel/trace/bpf_trace.c`, and `net/core/filter.c`.",

This leads to the possibility of **memory allocation with an excessive size value (CWE-789)** if this uninitialized resource is later used to determine the allocation size. It can also lead to **access of an uninitialized pointer (CWE-824)** if the uninitialized resource is a pointer that is dereferenced.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and key phrases, primarily focusing on the root cause of the vulnerability. The evidence suggests that the **improper map annotation** and the use of **uninitialized memory** are key factors.\n\nThe vulnerability description states \"The helpers really need to be annotated as ARG_PTR_TO_{LONG,INT} | MEM_UNINIT when results are written into them as opposed to read out of them\". This suggests a **missing initialization** which aligns with **CWE-909 Missing Initialization of Resource**.\n\nOther CWEs like **CWE-789 Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value** are considered because the improper handling of the uninitialized memory could lead to excessive memory allocation.\n\nThe final selection prioritizes **CWE-909** as the primary cause, with **CWE-789** and **CWE-824** as secondary issues that could arise from the initial flaw. The level of specificity is appropriate, focusing on the **missing initialization** at the Class level, and then the potential consequences that follow.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
