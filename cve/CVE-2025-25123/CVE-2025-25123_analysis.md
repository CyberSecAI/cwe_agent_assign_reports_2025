# Analysis for CVE-2025-25123

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | 0.9 | Compound | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis

The primary relationship is that CWE-352 **(Cross-Site Request Forgery)** is a compound weakness that can enable other vulnerabilities. In this case, the CSRF vulnerability allows for Stored XSS (CWE-79).
CWE-79, being a Base level CWE, provides a more specific description of the resulting vulnerability, while CWE-352 describes the initial **vector** that allows this to occur.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with a **missing** or **insufficient** CSRF protection (**CWE-352**). This leads to the attacker being able to trick a user into performing actions that result in the storage of malicious script in the application. When this stored script is rendered, it leads to Cross-Site Scripting (**CWE-79**).

CWE-352 (Root Cause) -> CWE-79 (Impact)

## Summary of Analysis

The initial analysis identified both CWE-352 and CWE-79 as potential candidates. The key phrase "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability" makes **CWE-352** an obvious candidate. The phrase "**stored XSS**" points to **CWE-79**.

The provided information in "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section states:
*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

The "Retriever Results" also lists CWE-79 and CWE-352 as the top candidates.

The relationship analysis shows that **CWE-352** can lead to other vulnerabilities, in this case, **CWE-79**, by allowing for the injection and storage of malicious script.

Based on the evidence, **CWE-352** is the primary **rootcause** of the vulnerability. **CWE-79** is a secondary weakness representing the type of **exploit** that is enabled by the **CWE-352** vulnerability.

I am confident in this assessment, but the confidence is not 1.0 due to the limited details in the vulnerability description.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
