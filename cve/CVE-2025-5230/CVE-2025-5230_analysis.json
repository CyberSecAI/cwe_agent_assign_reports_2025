The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter 'fromdate' and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n* SQL injection\n\nImpact of exploitation:\n* Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption, posing a serious threat to system security and business continuity.\n\nAttack vectors:\n* The 'fromdate' parameter can be exploited through a POST request.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\n* No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability\n\nMitigation or fix:\n1.  Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n2.  Input validation and filtering.\n3.  Minimize database user permissions.\n4.  Regular security audits.\n```",
