The plugin **unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation**. |\n| CWE-297 | Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The plugin **unconditionally disables hostname validation**. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **improper certificate validation (CWE-295)**, as the plugin completely disables SSL/TLS certificate validation. A more specific variant of this is **improper validation of certificate with host mismatch (CWE-297)**, as the plugin also disables hostname validation. CWE-297 is a child of CWE-295.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe295[\"CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\"]\n    cwe297[\"CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch\"]\n    \n    cwe297 -->|CHILDOF| cwe295\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe295 primary\n    class cwe297 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is: **Improper Certificate Validation** (CWE-295) and **Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch** (CWE-297) lead to potential Man-in-the-Middle attacks and exposure of sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which states that the Jenkins DingTalk Plugin **unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate and hostname validation**. This directly corresponds to **CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation)** and **CWE-297 (Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch)**. The retriever results also list these CWEs as top candidates. CWE-295 is a base level CWE, and CWE-297 is a variant that is more specific.
