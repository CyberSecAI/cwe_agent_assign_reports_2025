# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2025-47888

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-295 | Improper Certificate Validation | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The plugin **unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation**. |
| CWE-297 | Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch | 1.0 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The plugin **unconditionally disables hostname validation**. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **improper certificate validation (CWE-295)**, as the plugin completely disables SSL/TLS certificate validation. A more specific variant of this is **improper validation of certificate with host mismatch (CWE-297)**, as the plugin also disables hostname validation. CWE-297 is a child of CWE-295.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is: **Improper Certificate Validation** (CWE-295) and **Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch** (CWE-297) lead to potential Man-in-the-Middle attacks and exposure of sensitive information.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which states that the Jenkins DingTalk Plugin **unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate and hostname validation**. This directly corresponds to **CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation)** and **CWE-297 (Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch)**. The retriever results also list these CWEs as top candidates. CWE-295 is a base level CWE, and CWE-297 is a variant that is more specific. The high confidence score is due to the clear and direct evidence in the vulnerability description.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product communicates with a host that provides a certificate, but the product does not properly ensure that the certificate is actually associated with that host.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-862: Missing Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature

## CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 637.25
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
A protocol or its implementation supports interaction between multiple actors and allows those actors to negotiate which algorithm should be used as a protection mechanism such as encryption or authentication, but it does not select the strongest algorithm that is available to both parties.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
