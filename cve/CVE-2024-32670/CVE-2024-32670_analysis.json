While this is discouraged as a primary mapping, the limited information available doesn't allow for a more specific root cause. CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission) is considered as a secondary CWE because the BLE advertising is being scanned, which implies the information is being transmitted in cleartext. Both CWE-200 and CWE-319 are at different levels of abstraction, with CWE-200 being a Class and CWE-319 being a Base.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 transmitting sensitive information (location) via BLE advertising. This information is then exposed to unauthorized actors by simply scanning the BLE signals.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary analysis identifies **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** (CWE-200) as the primary weakness, as the core issue is the ability for unauthorized actors to identify the tag's location. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions this exposure. The evidence strength is low because the provided CVE Reference Links Content Summary returned `NOINFO`. The selection of CWE-200 is influenced by the vulnerability description key phrase \"**impact:** Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor and identify the tags location\".\n\nCWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is considered as a secondary weakness because BLE advertising is susceptible to sniffing and interception by unauthorized actors. If the BLE advertising wasn't in cleartext, it would be harder to identify the location.\n\nI considered other CWEs, especially those related to access control and authorization (CWE-284, CWE-285), but there's no clear indication of an **improper** authorization or access control mechanism. Instead, the issue is more related to the nature of the data being broadcast and how it can be intercepted and interpreted. Also, considered CWE-497, however, the information being exposed is not specifically system-level, but rather the tag's location, thus, CWE-200 is more appropriate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
