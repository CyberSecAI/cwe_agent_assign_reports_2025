  "description": "The OpenTelemetry Collector module AWS firehose receiver is for ingesting AWS Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream messages and parsing the records received based on the configured record type. `awsfirehosereceiver` allows unauthenticated remote requests, even when configured to require a key. OpenTelemetry Collector can be configured to receive CloudWatch metrics via an AWS Firehose Stream. Firehose sets the header `X-Amz-Firehose-Access-Key` with an arbitrary configured string. The OpenTelemetry Collector awsfirehosereceiver can optionally be configured to require this key on incoming requests. However, when this is configured it **still accepts incoming requests with no key**. Only OpenTelemetry Collector users configured with the alpha `awsfirehosereceiver` module are affected. This module was added in version v0.49.0 of the Contrib distribution (or may be included in custom builds). There is a risk of unauthorized users writing metrics. Carefully crafted metrics could hide other malicious activity. There is no risk of exfiltrating data. Its likely these endpoints will be exposed to the public internet, as Firehose does not support private HTTP endpoints. A fix was introduced in PR #34847 and released with v0.108.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45043:\n\n**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**\n\nThe provided content directly relates to CVE-2024-45043. Specifically, the vulnerability is in the `awsfirehosereceiver` module of the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib project, which is designed to receive data from AWS Firehose. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated requests, even when an access key is configured, as described in the github security advisory.\n\n**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause of the vulnerability lies in the flawed logic within the `awsfirehosereceiver`'s request validation. The code incorrectly treated the presence of the `X-Amz-Firehose-Access-Key` header as optional, regardless of whether an access key was configured in the receiver's settings. This allowed requests without the header, and thus without authentication, to be accepted.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the bypass of the access key authentication mechanism. Despite configuring an access key, the receiver accepted requests that did not include the `X-Amz-Firehose-Access-Key` header, effectively disabling authentication.\n*  **Incorrect Logic:** The core vulnerability stems from an `if` statement in the code that incorrectly made the access key header optional.\n\n**4. Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized Metric Ingestion:** Attackers could send arbitrary metrics to the OpenTelemetry Collector, potentially hiding malicious activity through crafted metrics.\n*   **Integrity Risk:** The injection of malicious data could impact the integrity of collected metrics.\n*   **No Data Exfiltration Risk:** The vulnerability did not allow data exfiltration.\n\n**5. Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attack vector is network-based, as the vulnerable receiver listens on a network port for HTTP requests.\n*   **Public Exposure:** The advisory states that these endpoints are likely exposed to the public internet because Firehose does not support private HTTP endpoints.\n\n**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the OpenTelemetry Collector's `awsfirehosereceiver` endpoint.\n*   **No Authentication Required:** No specific authentication credentials or access are needed, as the vulnerability allows bypassing the configured access key.\n\n**7. Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was present in versions >= 0.49.0 and < 0.108.0 of the `opentelemetry-collector-contrib` project.\n*   The fix was introduced in PR #34847 and released in v0.108.0\n*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) script was provided to demonstrate the vulnerability, highlighting the unauthorized metrics being printed to the console.\n*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 5.3, classified as \"Moderate.\"\n*   The patch changes the logic to ensure an access key is required if one is configured.\n*   The vulnerability is related to the `awsfirehosereceiver`, which is an alpha component of OpenTelemetry Collector.\n\nIn summary, CVE-2024-45043 is a moderate severity vulnerability caused by an authentication bypass in the `awsfirehosereceiver` component of the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib project, allowing unauthenticated attackers to inject metrics data. The fix involves correctly implementing access key validation to reject requests that don't have the proper key when it is configured.",
