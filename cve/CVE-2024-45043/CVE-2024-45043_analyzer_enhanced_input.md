## Vulnerability Description
The OpenTelemetry Collector module AWS firehose receiver is for ingesting AWS Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream messages and parsing the records received based on the configured record type. `awsfirehosereceiver` allows unauthenticated remote requests, even when configured to require a key. OpenTelemetry Collector can be configured to receive CloudWatch metrics via an AWS Firehose Stream. Firehose sets the header `X-Amz-Firehose-Access-Key` with an arbitrary configured string. The OpenTelemetry Collector awsfirehosereceiver can optionally be configured to require this key on incoming requests. However, when this is configured it **still accepts incoming requests with no key**. Only OpenTelemetry Collector users configured with the alpha `awsfirehosereceiver` module are affected. This module was added in version v0.49.0 of the Contrib distribution (or may be included in custom builds). There is a risk of unauthorized users writing metrics. Carefully crafted metrics could hide other malicious activity. There is no risk of exfiltrating data. Its likely these endpoints will be exposed to the public internet, as Firehose does not support private HTTP endpoints. A fix was introduced in PR #34847 and released with v0.108.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper authentication**

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45043:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2024-45043. Specifically, the vulnerability is in the `awsfirehosereceiver` module of the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib project, which is designed to receive data from AWS Firehose. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated requests, even when an access key is configured, as described in the github security advisory.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the flawed logic within the `awsfirehosereceiver`'s request validation. The code incorrectly treated the presence of the `X-Amz-Firehose-Access-Key` header as optional, regardless of whether an access key was configured in the receiver's settings. This allowed requests without the header, and thus without authentication, to be accepted.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the bypass of the access key authentication mechanism. Despite configuring an access key, the receiver accepted requests that did not include the `X-Amz-Firehose-Access-Key` header, effectively disabling authentication.
*  **Incorrect Logic:** The core vulnerability stems from an `if` statement in the code that incorrectly made the access key header optional.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Metric Ingestion:** Attackers could send arbitrary metrics to the OpenTelemetry Collector, potentially hiding malicious activity through crafted metrics.
*   **Integrity Risk:** The injection of malicious data could impact the integrity of collected metrics.
*   **No Data Exfiltration Risk:** The vulnerability did not allow data exfiltration.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack vector is network-based, as the vulnerable receiver listens on a network port for HTTP requests.
*   **Public Exposure:** The advisory states that these endpoints are likely exposed to the public internet because Firehose does not support private HTTP endpoints.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the OpenTelemetry Collector's `awsfirehosereceiver` endpoint.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No specific authentication credentials or access are needed, as the vulnerability allows bypassing the configured access key.

**7. Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in versions >= 0.49.0 and < 0.108.0 of the `opentelemetry-collector-contrib` project.
*   The fix was introduced in PR #34847 and released in v0.108.0
*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) script was provided to demonstrate the vulnerability, highlighting the unauthorized metrics being printed to the console.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 5.3, classified as "Moderate."
*   The patch changes the logic to ensure an access key is required if one is configured.
*   The vulnerability is related to the `awsfirehosereceiver`, which is an alpha component of OpenTelemetry Collector.

In summary, CVE-2024-45043 is a moderate severity vulnerability caused by an authentication bypass in the `awsfirehosereceiver` component of the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib project, allowing unauthenticated attackers to inject metrics data. The fix involves correctly implementing access key validation to reject requests that don't have the proper key when it is configured.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
