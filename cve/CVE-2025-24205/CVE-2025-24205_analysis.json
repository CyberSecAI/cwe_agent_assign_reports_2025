CWE-285 is a child of CWE-284, making it more specific. Given that the vulnerability description indicates an **authorization issue**, CWE-285 is a more appropriate choice. While CWE-284 could broadly apply, the presence of an authorization flaw suggests a more targeted classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **authorization issue**, leading to the impact of an app gaining access to user-sensitive data.\n\nAuthorization Issue -> Access to User-Sensitive Data\n\nHere, the **authorization issue** is the root cause.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered both CWE-284 and CWE-285.
