  "description": "Stardust is a platform for streaming isolated desktop containers. With this exploit, **inter container communication** (ICC) is not disabled. This would allow users within a container to access another containers agent, therefore compromising access.The problem has been patched in any Stardust build past 12/20/24. Users are advised to upgrade. Users may also manually disable ICC if they are unable to upgrade.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n- The root cause is the lack of disabled inter-container communication (ICC) within the Stardust container network. This means containers on the same network can communicate with each other without proper isolation.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Missing Inter-Container Communication (ICC) Restriction:** The primary weakness is the failure to disable ICC on the Stardust network. Docker networks, by default, allow containers on the same network to communicate. This lack of restriction allows unauthorized access between containers.\n- **Insufficient Isolation:**  The containers within the Stardust network are not sufficiently isolated from each other.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Compromised Access:** An attacker within one container can potentially access the agent of another container.\n- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The CVSS v4 metrics indicate high impact to Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of the vulnerable system.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network, meaning an attacker within any container connected to the vulnerable network could initiate the attack.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Access to a Container on the Same Network:** The attacker must have access to at least one container within the vulnerable Stardust network.\n- **No Special Privileges Required:** The attacker does not require any specific privileges on the target system to exploit the vulnerability.\n- **No User Interaction:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing any interaction from other users.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The provided content includes suggested workarounds, which involve recreating the Docker network with the `--opt \"com.docker.network.bridge.enable_icc\"=\"false\"` option and reconnecting the containers.\n- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v4 score of 9.3, which is considered critical.\n- The CVE ID associated with this vulnerability is CVE-2024-56330.\n- The weakness is categorized as CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)\n\nThis analysis provides detailed information about the vulnerability, including its causes, impacts, attack vectors, and mitigations.",

CWE-923 is a peer that could be considered to better capture the **improper restriction of the communication channel**. The decision to include CWE-923 as a secondary is based on the analysis that the root cause is **missing inter-container communication restriction** and the impact of access to another container agent.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe923[\"CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\"]\n\n    cwe923 -->|PEER_OF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe923 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing inter-container communication restriction**, which leads to **improper access control** and ultimately allows an attacker to **access another container's agent**, compromising access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment based on the provided evidence points towards CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). The vulnerability description highlights the **lack of disabled inter-container communication** (ICC), leading to unauthorized access between containers. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly categorizes the weakness as CWE-284. However, the Retriever Results also suggest CWE-923 (Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints).\n\nThe relationship analysis shows that CWE-923 could be a more specific classification focusing on the communication aspect of the vulnerability. Considering the root cause is the **missing ICC restriction**, CWE-923 is added as a secondary candidate to better capture the communication channel aspect, while CWE-284 remains the primary due to its explicit mention in the CVE summary and broader applicability to the access control issue.\n\nThe final decision to include both CWE-284 and CWE-923 is based on a comprehensive analysis of the vulnerability description, supporting evidence, and the relationships between candidate CWEs.
