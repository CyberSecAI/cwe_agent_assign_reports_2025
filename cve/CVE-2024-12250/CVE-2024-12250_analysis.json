  "description": "The Accept Authorize.NET Payments Using Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Information Exposure** in all versions up to, and including, 2.2 via the cf7adn-info.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract configuration data which can be used to aid in other attacks.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-12250:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the plugin's use of the `cf7adn-info.php` file, which exposes sensitive configuration data. This file was accessible without any authentication.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Information Exposure:** The core issue is the exposure of sensitive plugin configuration details to unauthorized users. This is a direct violation of security best practices and could reveal information useful in further attacks.\n*   **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerable file `cf7adn-info.php` did not require any form of authentication to access, making it trivial for attackers to retrieve its content.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract configuration data. This information could include API keys, database credentials or other configuration settings, potentially leading to further attacks.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Direct Access:** The primary attack vector is direct access to the vulnerable `cf7adn-info.php` file via a web browser request. No special tools or techniques are needed.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need any credentials or prior access to the WordPress site.\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network connectivity to the target server hosting the vulnerable WordPress site.\n\n**Summary of Changes in Version 2.3:**\nThe provided changeset shows that version 2.3 addresses the security issue by:\n*   Incrementing the plugin's version to 2.3\n*   Removing the vulnerable `cf7adn-info.php` template file from the plugin\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The Wordfence description of the vulnerability provides a clear and concise explanation of the issue.\n*   The changeset from the WordPress plugin directory confirms that a fix has been implemented by removing the vulnerable file and updating the version.\n*   The CVSS score of 5.3 indicates a medium-severity vulnerability, based on the potential impact of data exposure.",

While more specific CWEs related to information exposure exist, CWE-200 accurately captures the core issue: the **exposure** of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is a contributing factor, as the lack of authentication on the `cf7adn-info.php` file directly enabled the information exposure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing authentication** on a critical file (`cf7adn-info.php`). This **lack of authentication** allows unauthorized access, leading to the **exposure of sensitive configuration data**. The final impact is potential further attacks aided by the disclosed information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **information exposure** aspect of the vulnerability. The provided evidence strongly supports this, as the `cf7adn-info.php` file directly exposed sensitive configuration data without any authentication. The relationship analysis highlighted the importance of considering contributing factors, such as the **missing authentication**, which directly enabled the **information exposure**. While CWE-200 is generally discouraged as a root cause, in this specific scenario, it accurately captures the core problem, as the sensitive data was directly exposed due to the file's accessibility. The addition of CWE-306 clarifies the underlying reason for this **exposure**.
