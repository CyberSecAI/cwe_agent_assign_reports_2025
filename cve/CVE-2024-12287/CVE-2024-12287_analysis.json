This is due to the **plugin not properly verifying a users identity prior to authenticating them**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as other users, such as administrators, granted they have access to an email.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12287\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe Biagiotti Membership plugin for WordPress fails to properly verify a user's identity before authenticating them. This flaw stems from inadequate implementation of authentication procedures.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- Improper Authentication: The plugin does not adequately validate user identity prior to authentication. This weakness allows attackers to bypass normal login procedures.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Authentication Bypass: Unauthenticated attackers can log in as other users, including administrators.\n- Full Control: Once logged in, attackers have the same privileges as the compromised user, potentially leading to complete site takeover.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Network Access: The vulnerability is accessible over the network.\n- No User Interaction: The attack requires no user interaction, making it more easily exploitable.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- Unauthenticated access: Attackers do not need any existing accounts or credentials.\n- Email Address: Attackers only need access to an email address associated with an account on the vulnerable system.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The vulnerability is present in Biagiotti Membership plugin versions up to and including 1.0.2.\n- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS score of 9.8 (Critical)\n- The vulnerability was discovered by Tonn.\n- The plugin has been patched in version 1.1.",

Since the description explicitly states that the plugin doesn't properly verify users' identities *before* authenticating them, it indicates a lack of authentication rather than an incorrect authentication process. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was considered, but the issue precedes authorization, making CWE-306 a better fit.
