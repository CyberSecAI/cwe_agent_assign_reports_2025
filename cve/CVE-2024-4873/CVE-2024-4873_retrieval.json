  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-4873', description='The Replace Image plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Insecure Direct Object Reference** in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.10 via the image replacement functionality due to **missing validation on a user controlled key**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to replace images uploaded by higher level users such as admins.', key_phrases={'rootcause': ['Insecure Direct Object Reference', 'missing validation on a user controlled key'], 'weakness': '', 'impact': 'replace images uploaded by higher level users', 'vector': '', 'attacker': 'authenticated attackers with Author-level access and above', 'product': 'Replace Image plugin for WordPress', 'version': 'all versions up to and including 1.1.10', 'component': 'image replacement functionality'}, reference_content='Based on the provided content, here\\'s a breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**Root Cause:**\\n\\n*   The vulnerability lies in the \"Replace Image\" plugin for WordPress, specifically in how it handles image replacement. The plugin fails to validate a user-controlled key during the image replacement process.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\\n\\n*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The core vulnerability is an IDOR. The plugin does not properly verify if the user initiating the replace action has the required permission to modify the target image. It relies on a user-controlled key, which can be manipulated to target images not owned by the current user.\\n*   **Authorization Bypass:** The lack of proper validation allows an attacker to bypass authorization checks.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n\\n*   **Unauthorized Image Replacement:** Authenticated users with Author-level access or higher can replace images uploaded by higher-level users (e.g., administrators). This can lead to:\\n    *   **Defacement:** Replacing images with malicious or inappropriate content.\\n    *   **Loss of Data Integrity:** Tampering with images, potentially breaking website functionality.\\n    *   **Content Manipulation:** Altering the visual presentation of a site.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n\\n*   **Network:** The attack is conducted over the network via the WordPress web interface.\\n*   **User-Controlled Key:** The attacker manipulates the user-controlled key during the image replacement process.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n\\n*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account on the target WordPress site with at least Author-level privileges.\\n*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to understand how the image replacement process works and how the user-controlled key can be manipulated.\\n\\n**Additional Details:**\\n\\n*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the Replace Image plugin up to and including version 1.1.10.\\n*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.1.11 by adding a permission check on the image to be replaced and preventing the display of the \"Replace Image\" button on images that the user isn\\'t allowed to replace.\\n*   The provided changelog from the wordpress.org page confirms the fix in version 1.1.11: \"* Add permissions check on image to be replaced * Don\u2019t show Replace Image button on images that the user isn\u2019t allowed to replace\"', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [],
