Affected by this vulnerability is the function upload of the file src/main/java/com/itheima/reggie/controller/CommonController.java. The manipulation of the argument file leads to **unrestricted upload**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-0402 Content\n\nThe provided content **IS RELATED** to a vulnerability. It details a file upload vulnerability in the \"reggie\" application. Here's a breakdown of the information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe upload method in `src/main/java/com/itheima/reggie/controller/CommonController.java` only performs front-end validation on file suffixes. This means an attacker can bypass the intended file type restrictions.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** Lack of robust server-side validation on uploaded files.\n*   **File Upload Vulnerability:**  Allows arbitrary file uploads due to weak validation.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nThe vulnerability allows attackers to upload any file, potentially leading to:\n\n*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Uploading a malicious file (e.g., a JSP file containing code) and executing it on the server.\n*   **Server Compromise:**  Gaining control of the server by uploading and executing malicious code.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **HTTP POST Request:**  The attacker sends a crafted `POST` request to the `/common/upload` endpoint with a malicious file. The provided example shows a `POST` request with a `test.jsp` file containing code (`<% out.println(\"test\"); %>`).\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application's `/common/upload` endpoint.\n*   **No Authentication Required:** The provided example shows that no login is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not explicitly state a fix, but the implication is that server-side validation of file types and content is required. This should include:\n\n*   **Whitelisting allowed file types:** Only allow specific, safe file extensions.\n*   **Content inspection:** Verify the file content to ensure it matches the expected type.\n*   **Secure storage:** Store uploaded files in a secure location with restricted access.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\nThe content provides more detail than a typical CVE description by including:\n\n*   Specific file path of the vulnerable code (`src/main/java/com/itheima/reggie/controller/CommonController.java`).\n*   A complete example of a malicious `POST` request.\n*   Screenshots of the vulnerability report.",

The vulnerability allows unrestricted file uploads, making this the most direct match. |\n| CWE-646 | Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE. Since the vulnerability description mentions that only front-end validation is performed on the file suffixes, it suggests a reliance on the file name or extension, making this a relevant secondary CWE. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship is between the **unrestricted upload** and the **reliance on filename extension**. The file upload vulnerability (CWE-434) can often be caused by relying on the file extension (CWE-646) provided by the user, which can be easily spoofed.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    cwe646[\"CWE-646: Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File\"]\n    \n    cwe646 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe434\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe434 primary\n    class cwe646 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **improper input validation** on the uploaded file, which leads to **unrestricted upload**, and finally to potential **remote code execution**.\n\nRoot Cause: **Insufficient Input Validation** -> **CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type** -> Impact: Remote Code Execution/Server Compromise\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type)** as the primary weakness due to the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning \"**unrestricted upload**\". The CVE reference link content summary confirmed this by stating that the root cause of the vulnerability is the upload method performing only front-end validation on file suffixes, indicating **insufficient input validation** on uploaded files.\n\nAdditionally, **CWE-646 (Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File)** was considered as a secondary weakness. The vulnerability description mentioned only front-end validation on file suffixes, which directly correlates with relying on the file name or extension provided by the user.\n\nThe graph relationship shows how reliance on the file name or extension can precede an unrestricted upload vulnerability.\n\nI am confident in this assessment because it's based on the explicit vulnerability description and supporting evidence from the CVE reference link content summary.
