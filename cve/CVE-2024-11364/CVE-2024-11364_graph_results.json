  "query": "Another uninitialized variable code execution vulnerability exists in the Rockwell Automation Arena that could allow a threat actor to craft a DOE file and force the software to access a variable prior to it being initialized. If exploited, a threat actor could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code. To exploit this vulnerability, a legitimate user must execute the malicious code crafted by the threat actor.",
