  "description": "A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in Weitong Mall 1.0.0. This affects an unknown part of the file /historyList of the component Product History Handler. The manipulation of the argument isDelete with the input 1 leads to **improper access controls**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

CWE-425 is related, as it describes a situation where direct requests bypass intended access controls. CWE-425 is a child of CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), suggesting a lack of authorization checks could be a contributing factor.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe266 primary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability begins with **improper access controls** (CWE-266), allowing direct access to resources (CWE-425). This leads to the exposure of sensitive data, which is the impact of the vulnerability.\n  - The chain starts with an incorrect privilege assignment.\n  - This leads to direct requests bypassing security mechanisms.\n  - Resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability based on the description and CVE reference. The description clearly states \"**improper access controls**,\" pointing towards authorization or privilege management issues. The CVE reference strengthens this, mentioning that the `/historyList` endpoint **does not enforce authentication or role-based access control** and that the vulnerability is a Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA).\n\nBased on this evidence, CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) is the most appropriate primary CWE, representing the root cause. CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) could be a secondary CWE, since the endpoint can be directly accessed.\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that the vulnerability could be viewed as a chain of weaknesses.\n\nCWE-266 is selected as the primary CWE due to its direct relation to the \"**improper access controls**\" and the root cause of the vulnerability. It is at the base level of abstraction, making it specific enough to describe the weakness accurately.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n### CWE Selection:\n\n*   **CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment**\n    *   **Explanation:** The vulnerability description and the CVE reference indicate that the application **does not properly restrict access** to the `/historyList` endpoint, allowing unauthorized users to access sensitive data. This aligns with CWE-266, which describes a scenario where a privilege is used to perform unsafe actions. The fact that the endpoint lacks role-based access control and authentication suggests that privileges are not being assigned or checked correctly.\n    *   **Security Implications:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential data breaches, and abuse of internal data.\n    *   **Relationship:** This is the primary CWE because it represents the root cause of the vulnerability.\n    *   **Mapping Guidance:** The usage is \"Allowed,\" and the rationale states that it is at the Base level of abstraction.\n    *   **Confidence:** 0.9\n*   **CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')**\n    *   **Explanation:** CWE-425 describes a scenario where the web application **does not adequately enforce authorization** on restricted URLs.
