## Vulnerability Description
There exists a security vulnerability in Jettys DosFilter which can be exploited by unauthorized users to cause remote denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the server using DosFilter. By repeatedly sending crafted requests, attackers can trigger OutofMemory errors and exhaust the servers memory finally.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** remote denial-of-service (DoS)
- **vector:** crafted requests
- **attacker:** unauthorized users
- **product:** Jettys DosFilter

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `DoSFilter` in Jetty was designed to track client request patterns using various methods, including sessions. However, the internal tracking mechanism, particularly the session-based tracking, was flawed. The filter did not properly remove `USER_AUTH` entries leading to a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Memory Leak:** The `DoSFilter` does not properly remove `RateTracker` entries associated with `USER_AUTH` type, leading to a memory leak. This can be exploited by repeatedly sending crafted requests.
- **Improper Resource Management:** The filter's session-based tracking was vulnerable to abuse. Attackers could exhaust server memory by sending numerous requests, causing the server to store excessive session information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability to cause a remote denial-of-service attack. By sending crafted requests, attackers can trigger `OutOfMemory` errors, leading to server memory exhaustion.
- **Server Unavailability:**  The memory exhaustion can render the server unresponsive and unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack is performed remotely over the network.
- **Crafted Requests:** Attackers need to send specifically crafted requests to the vulnerable server to trigger the memory exhaustion.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any authentication or privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Ability to Send Requests:**  The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is present in Jetty versions 9.x, 10.x, 11.x and 12.x
- The vulnerability has been fixed by removing the session tracking mode in the `DoSFilter`.
- A workaround exists by configuring the `DoSFilter` to only track requests by IP address (`trackSessions` init parameter set to `false`).
