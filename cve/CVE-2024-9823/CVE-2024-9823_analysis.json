  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n- The `DoSFilter` in Jetty was designed to track client request patterns using various methods, including sessions. However, the internal tracking mechanism, particularly the session-based tracking, was flawed. The filter did not properly remove `USER_AUTH` entries leading to a memory leak.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Memory Leak:** The `DoSFilter` does not properly remove `RateTracker` entries associated with `USER_AUTH` type, leading to a memory leak. This can be exploited by repeatedly sending crafted requests.\n- **Improper Resource Management:** The filter's session-based tracking was vulnerable to abuse. Attackers could exhaust server memory by sending numerous requests, causing the server to store excessive session information.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability to cause a remote denial-of-service attack. By sending crafted requests, attackers can trigger `OutOfMemory` errors, leading to server memory exhaustion.\n- **Server Unavailability:**  The memory exhaustion can render the server unresponsive and unavailable to legitimate users.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Network:** The attack is performed remotely over the network.\n- **Crafted Requests:** Attackers need to send specifically crafted requests to the vulnerable server to trigger the memory exhaustion.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any authentication or privileges to exploit this vulnerability.\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server.\n- **Ability to Send Requests:**  The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server.\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n- The vulnerability is present in Jetty versions 9.x, 10.x, 11.x and 12.x\n- The vulnerability has been fixed by removing the session tracking mode in the `DoSFilter`.\n- A workaround exists by configuring the `DoSFilter` to only track requests by IP address (`trackSessions` init parameter set to `false`).\n\nThe provided content provides more detail than the CVE description, which is just a placeholder.",

This is a base-level CWE that accurately reflects the root cause of the vulnerability, where the `DoSFilter` allocates resources without proper limits. CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption is a parent Class of CWE-770, representing the broader category of resource exhaustion issues but is discouraged for this specific case. CWE-789 Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value is also related, as the unlimited allocation leads to excessive memory usage, but CWE-770 better captures the initial allocation flaw.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe789 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper allocation of resources without limits or throttling** (CWE-770). This leads to excessive memory allocation, which can be seen as contributing to CWE-789. The ultimate impact is **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400), resulting in a denial-of-service condition.\n\nCWE-770 (Root Cause) -> CWE-789 (Excessive Memory Allocation) -> CWE-400 (Resource Exhaustion) -> Denial of Service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which highlights the root cause as a **memory leak** due to the `DoSFilter` **not properly removing `RateTracker` entries** associated with `USER_AUTH`. This directly indicates **improper resource management** and **unlimited allocation of resources**, aligning well with CWE-770.\n\nThe selection of CWE-770 is further supported by the Retriever Results, which lists it as a top candidate with a \"Base\" abstraction level, preferred for root cause mappings. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-770 is a more specific and appropriate choice than its parent class, CWE-400, which is discouraged for low-information reports. While CWE-789 is also relevant, it represents the consequence of the initial allocation issue rather than the root cause itself.\n\nTherefore, CWE-770 is the optimal choice for representing the vulnerability's root cause, providing the most accurate and detailed classification based on the available evidence and mapping guidance.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs.
