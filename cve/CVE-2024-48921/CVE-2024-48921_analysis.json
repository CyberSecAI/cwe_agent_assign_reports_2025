  "description": "Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes. A kyverno ClusterPolicy, ie. disallow-privileged-containers, can be overridden by the creation of a PolicyException in a random namespace. By design, **PolicyExceptions are consumed from any namespace**. Administrators may not recognize that this allows users with privileges to non-kyverno namespaces to create exceptions. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.13.0.",

    "rootcause": "PolicyExceptions are consumed from any namespace",
    "weakness": "",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n- Kyverno's `PolicyException` objects, designed to override `ClusterPolicy` enforcement, can be created in any namespace by default. This allows users with privileges in non-kyverno namespaces to bypass policies, even if those policies are meant to apply to resources in other namespaces.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n- **Incorrect Access Control:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control regarding the creation of `PolicyException` objects. Specifically, any user with resource creation privileges in any namespace can create a `PolicyException` object that affects policies defined for other namespaces.\n- **Bypass of Intended Policy Enforcement:** The vulnerability allows users to circumvent intended security policies set by administrators using `ClusterPolicy`, which are designed to enforce rules across the entire cluster.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker, by creating a `PolicyException`, can bypass a security policy, for example `disallow-privileged-containers` policy. This allows the attacker to create resources such as privileged containers which can then be used to escalate privileges to root on the node and potentially further compromise the cluster.\n- **Compromised Security Posture:** The vulnerability weakens the overall security posture of the cluster by enabling bypass of security controls.\n- **Undermining Policy Intent:**  Administrators may believe they are enforcing security across the cluster, but their policies can be overridden by less privileged users in unexpected ways.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- The attack vector is adjacent, meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network as the Kubernetes cluster where Kyverno is running.\n- The attacker must have the ability to create resources in a Kubernetes namespace.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Kubernetes User with Resource Creation Privileges:** An attacker needs to be a user who has permissions to create Kubernetes resources, specifically the `PolicyException` object, in any namespace of the cluster.\n- **Knowledge of Kyverno Policies:** An attacker needs knowledge of the Kyverno `ClusterPolicy` they want to bypass, and how to configure a corresponding PolicyException to achieve this bypass.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The provided CVSS v4 metrics (AV:A/AC:H/AT:P/PR:H/UI:A/VC:H/VI:L/VA:L/SC:L/SI:H/SA:L) give a detailed view of the complexity and impact of this vulnerability.\n-  The GitHub Security Advisory (GHSA-qjvc-p88j-j9rm) identifies the issue and indicates that versions of Kyverno prior to 1.13.0 are affected. Version 1.13.0 includes the fix.",

This leads to **Incorrect Authorization** (CWE-863), where users in non-kyverno namespaces can create exceptions, overriding intended policies. The impact is the ability to bypass security policies.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) because the **PolicyExceptions are consumed from any namespace**, which allows users to bypass intended security policies. This indicates an authorization issue, where the check to determine if a user can create a `PolicyException` is flawed. The evidence for this is the vulnerability description itself: \"**PolicyExceptions are consumed from any namespace**\". This means that the authorization logic is not correctly restricting the creation of these exceptions to only authorized users or namespaces.\n\nCWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) was considered because the vulnerability involves users in non-kyverno namespaces being able to create exceptions. However, the core issue is not that the users are assigned the wrong privileges, but rather that the authorization check for creating `PolicyException` objects is flawed. Therefore, CWE-863 is a more accurate fit.\n\nCWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) was also considered because the vulnerability involves `PolicyException` objects being accessible from any namespace, but it is a high-level Class CWE and is less specific than CWE-863.\n\nMy assessment is based on the provided evidence, and the graph relationships influenced my selection by highlighting the hierarchical relationships between the candidate CWEs. CWE-863 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately describes the authorization flaw, where the check to determine if a user can create a `PolicyException` is flawed.",
