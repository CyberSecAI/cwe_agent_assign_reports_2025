# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-32849

## Vulnerability Description
Trend Micro Security 17.x (Consumer) is vulnerable to a **Privilege Escalation vulnerability** that could allow a local attacker to unintentionally delete privileged Trend Micro files including its own.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **Privilege Escalation vulnerability**
- **impact:** Privilege Escalation and delete privileged Trend Micro files
- **attacker:** local attacker
- **product:** Trend Micro Security
- **version:** 17.x

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `coreServiceShell` component of Trend Micro Maximum Security, specifically how it handles symbolic links. By creating a symbolic link, an attacker can trick the service into deleting arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Link Following/Symbolic Link Vulnerability:** The core issue lies in the service's improper handling of symbolic links, leading to unintended file deletion.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The ability to delete files via the service, allows a low privileged user to manipulate privileged system files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** A local attacker can leverage this vulnerability to delete any file, including critical Trend Micro files.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating the file system, an attacker can escalate their privileges to SYSTEM level.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The ultimate impact is the potential execution of arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the target system.
- **Symbolic Link Creation:** The attacker must be able to create symbolic links on the system.
- **Abuse of coreServiceShell:** The exploit involves manipulating the service using the created symbolic links.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- The attacker needs to create symbolic links, which generally requires some degree of file system access, even as a low privileged user.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Trend Micro Maximum Security version 17.7 for Windows.
- Trend Micro has released an update (version 17.7 or higher) to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by Nicholas Zubrisky and Michael DePlante of Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
- The CVSSv3 score is 7.8, indicating high severity, with vectors AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
