# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-51567

## Vulnerability Description
upgrademysqlstatus in databases/views.py in CyberPanel (aka Cyber Panel) before 5b08cd6 allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary commands via /dataBases/upgrademysqlstatus by bypassing secMiddleware (which is only for a POST request) and using shell metacharacters in the statusfile property, as exploited in the wild in October 2024 by PSAUX. Versions through 2.3.6 and (unpatched) 2.3.7 are affected.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** bypass authentication and execute arbitrary commands
- **vector:** shell metacharacters in statusfile property
- **attacker:** remote attackers
- **product:** CyberPanel
- **version:** before 5b08cd6
- **component:** upgrademysqlstatus in databases/views.py

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-51567:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a combination of factors:

1.  **Lack of Centralized Authentication:** CyberPanel implements authentication checks on a per-route basis instead of using a central authentication system/middleware. This leads to inconsistencies and missed checks on some API routes.
2.  **Command Injection:** User-supplied inputs are not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject and execute arbitrary system commands via the `ProcessUtilities.outputExecutioner()` function.
3.  **Middleware Bypass:** The implemented security middleware only filters POST requests. It can be bypassed by sending requests using other HTTP methods like `OPTIONS` or `PUT`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The `upgrademysqlstatus` route in `/dataBases/views.py` lacks authentication checks, allowing unauthenticated users to access it.
*   **Command Injection:** The `upgrademysqlstatus` function takes a `statusfile` parameter directly from the user and uses it in a command that's executed with root privileges using `sudo`. This enables command injection.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** Input sanitization is not applied to the statusfile parameter used in the `upgrademysqlstatus` function.
*   **Security Middleware Bypass:** The security middleware is bypassed by using HTTP methods other than `POST`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server as root.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation grants an attacker complete control of the affected server, potentially leading to data theft, data encryption, malware deployment, and denial of service.
*   **Mass Ransomware Deployment**: As seen in the content, threat actors mass-exploited the vulnerability to deploy PSAUX ransomware.
*  **Mass Cryptominer deployment**: In some cases, the same vulnerability was used to deploy cryptominers.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** Attackers can send a specially crafted HTTP request to the `/dataBases/upgrademysqlstatus` endpoint, using a method other than `POST` (e.g., `PUT`, `OPTIONS`).
*   **JSON Payload:** The request body contains a JSON payload with the `statusfile` parameter containing the command injection payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable CyberPanel instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is pre-authentication, meaning the attacker does not need any valid user credentials.
*   **HTTP Skills:** The attacker must be able to craft and send HTTP requests with specific methods (e.g., PUT) and JSON payloads.

**Additional details from the provided content**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by security researcher DreyAnd and reported to the CyberPanel developers.
*   The developers released a patch in version 2.3.8.
*  A proof of concept exploit was created and shared which demonstrated root-level remote command execution.
*   The vulnerability was mass-exploited by the PSAUX ransomware group, causing significant disruption to CyberPanel users.
*   Other threat actors also used the flaw to deploy other ransomware and cryptominers
*   A decryptor was made available by LeakIX due to a flaw in the way that the PSAUX ransomware encrypted the files.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
