The vulnerability description clearly states a **prompt injection** vulnerability, which aligns directly with CWE-1427's description of **improper neutralization of input used for LLM prompting**. The impact, which is the access and exfiltration of chat data, is represented by CWE-200, **exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor**.\n\nThe evidence for CWE-1427 is derived from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section, which explicitly mentions \"**rootcause: prompt injection**\".
