It has hierarchical relationships, being a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), and chain relationships, being able to precede CWE-822 (Untrusted Pointer Dereference), CWE-823 (Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset), CWE-824 (Access of Uninitialized Pointer), and CWE-825 (Expired Pointer Dereference).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the camera driver setting an offset variable that leads to **memory corruption** when taking a snapshot. The root cause of this **memory corruption** is identified as CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a high confidence in assigning CWE-787 as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **memory corruption** due to an offset variable from the camera driver.\n\nThe retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-787 as the most relevant CWE, with a score of 1.0. The relationship analysis further supports this choice, placing CWE-787 as a base level weakness that can lead to other memory-related issues.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity (Base), providing a clear and accurate representation of the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially
