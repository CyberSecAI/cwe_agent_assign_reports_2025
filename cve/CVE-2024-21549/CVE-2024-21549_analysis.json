An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by utilizing view-sourcefile//, which allows for arbitrary file reading on a local file. **Note** This is a bypass of the fix for [CVE-2024-21544](https//security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PHP-SPATIEBROWSERSHOT-8496745).",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-21549:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation within the `setUrl` method of the `spatie/browsershot` library. Specifically, the library attempts to block file access by checking for the presence of protocols like `file://`, `file:/`, `file:\\\\`, and `file:\\\\\\`. However, it fails to account for the `view-source:` protocol which, combined with the `file://` scheme, can be used to bypass the checks and read arbitrary local files.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core weakness is the incomplete sanitization of the URL provided to the `setUrl` method. While some file protocols were blocked, `view-source:` was overlooked. This allows attackers to bypass the intended restrictions.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary File Read:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read any file on the local system accessible to the process running the vulnerable code. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information such as configuration files, credentials, or source code.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be triggered through network requests that influence the URL passed to the vulnerable function.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to control the URL passed to the `Browsershot::url()` method. This could occur in a web application or any other context where user-supplied or attacker-controlled input is used to generate screenshots or PDFs with the library.\n*   No special privileges are required. The vulnerability is exploitable without requiring any user interaction.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\nThe vulnerable code snippet is present in the `setUrl` function of `src/Browsershot.php`.\n\n```php\npublic function setUrl(string $url): static\n{\n    $url = trim($url);\n\n    $unsupportedProtocols = ['file://', 'file:/', 'file:\\\\', 'file:\\\\\\\\'];\n\n    foreach ($unsupportedProtocols as $unsupportedProtocol) {\n        if (str_starts_with(strtolower($url), $unsupportedProtocol)) {\n            throw FileUrlNotAllowed::make();\n        }\n    }\n\n    $this->url = $url;\n    $this->html = '';\n\n    return $this;\n}\n```\n\nThe vulnerability is triggered by providing a URL such as `view-source:file:///etc/passwd` which bypasses the checks.\n\n**Patch:**\n\nThe fix was implemented in commit `f791ce0ae8dd99367dbfa30588ee31e1196e1728` which added `view-source` to the list of unsupported protocols. The fixed code looks like this:\n\n```php\n    $unsupportedProtocols = [\n        'file://',\n        'file:/',\n        'file:\\\\',\n        'file:\\\\\\\\',\n        'view-source',\n    ];\n```\nAnd a new test case was added to check this fix.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   This vulnerability is a bypass for a previous fix for CVE-2024-21544, demonstrating that initial fix was insufficient.\n*   The Snyk vulnerability report assigned a severity score of 8.7 (High) using CVSS v3.1.\n*   The fix was included in `spatie/browsershot` version 5.0.3.",

The vulnerability description and CVE details clearly point to this as the root cause. CWE-22 is a possible related weakness as the **Improper Input Validation** led to a path traversal, but it is not the primary issue.

This leads to arbitrary file reading, effectively creating a path traversal vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and CVE details. The **rootcause** is clearly **Improper Input Validation** (CWE-20). The `setUrl` method fails to adequately sanitize the URL, which allows an attacker to bypass intended restrictions and read arbitrary local files.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the connection to potential path traversal issues (CWE-22). However, the primary focus remains on the initial input validation failure.\n\nCWE-20 is at the optimal level of specificity, representing the core issue.
