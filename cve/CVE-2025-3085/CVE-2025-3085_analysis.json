CWE-296 (Improper Following of a Certificate's Chain of Trust) is a peer of CWE-299 and could also be considered since the vulnerability involves the certificate chain, but CWE-299 is more specific since the **failure to check revocation status** is the core issue. CWE-295 is a parent of both CWE-299 and CWE-296, representing a higher-level abstraction of certificate validation issues. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is related to the impact of improper authentication, but it is not the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe299[\"CWE-299: Improper Check for Certificate Revocation\"]\n    cwe296[\"CWE-296: Improper Following of a Certificate's Chain of Trust\"]\n    cwe295[\"CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe299 -->|CHILDOF| cwe295\n    cwe296 -->|CHILDOF| cwe295\n    cwe296 --|PEEROF| cwe299\n    cwe306 -->|RELATED_TO| cwe299\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe299 primary\n    class cwe296,cwe295,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **fails to check the revocation status of the intermediate certificates in the peers certificate chain** (CWE-299). This leads to potential **improper authentication**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **failure to check the revocation status of intermediate certificates**, which directly aligns with CWE-299 (Improper Check for Certificate Revocation). The vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary provide strong evidence for this classification. The relationship analysis highlights the connection between CWE-299 and its parent, CWE-295, and its peer, CWE-296, but CWE-299 is the most specific and accurate representation of the **root cause**.\n\nThe description explicitly states that the MongoDB server \"**fails to check the revocation status of the intermediate certificates in the peers certificate chain**\". This statement directly corresponds to the definition of CWE-299, which is \"The product does not properly check for certificate revocation.\"\n\nThe impact of this weakness is **improper authentication**, but the root cause is the **missing revocation check**, making CWE-299 the primary CWE.\n\nI considered the other CWEs from the Retriever Results, but they do not accurately represent the specific vulnerability. For example, CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is related to the impact of improper authentication but does not capture the **root cause** of the vulnerability. CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) is a broader category and less specific than CWE-299.\nBased on the provided information, CWE-299 is the most appropriate and specific CWE to classify this vulnerability, and it is at the optimal level of specificity (Base).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product communicates with a host that provides a certificate, but the product does not properly ensure that the certificate is actually associated with that host.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
