There are no direct parent-child, chain, or peer relationships that significantly influence the selection in this specific case. The abstraction level of CWE-203 is Base, which is the preferred level for root cause analysis.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe203[\"CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe203 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** The goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin **does not inject extra characters into broadcasted frames to obfuscate the length of messages**.\n2.  **Impact:** An attacker can determine the length of the payload, regardless of encryption.\n\nThe chain is direct, and there are no missing links based on the provided information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE identified is CWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy). This assessment is strongly supported by the vulnerability description, which explicitly states that the goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin **does not inject extra characters into broadcasted frames to obfuscate the length of messages**, leading to the ability to determine the length of the payload.\n\nThe selection of CWE-203 is based on the vulnerability description and the retriever results, which identify CWE-203 as the primary CWE match for similar vulnerability descriptions. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also supports this classification, mentioning \"Observable Response Discrepancy (CWE-204)\" as a weakness, which is closely related to CWE-203.\n\nThe graph relationships didn't influence the final selection, since the vulnerability is fairly self-contained. The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as it directly represents the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected:* This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability isn't about incorrect destination specification but rather the **lack of message length obfuscation**.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected:* This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not about transmitting data in cleartext, but about revealing the length of the encrypted payload.\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not selected:* This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not about improper filtering of special elements.\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected:* This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not related to format string vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Selected:* This CWE is highly relevant because the vulnerability allows an attacker to observe the length of the payload, regardless of the encryption used. This is a clear case of an observable discrepancy that exposes security-relevant information. The key phrase \"**does not inject extra characters into broadcasted frames to obfuscate the length of messages**\" directly supports this.\n\n## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected:* This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not about authentication bypass.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not selected:* This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not about the use of random values.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not selected:* This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not about weak credentials.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not selected:* This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not about improper encoding or escaping of output.\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not selected:* This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not about origin validation.\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 686.00\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping",
