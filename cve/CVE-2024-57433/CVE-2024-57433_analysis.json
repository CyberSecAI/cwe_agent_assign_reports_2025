CWE-613 is a child of CWE-672 (Operation on Resource After Expiry), indicating a broader category of issues related to resource management after their intended lifespan. While CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a parent and a more general case, the specific nature of the vulnerability points more directly to session expiration. I have considered the chain relationship of CANPRECEDE for CWE-613 to CWE-287, and chose CWE-613 due to the details matching to the description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe613[\"CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on Resource After Expiry\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe613 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe613 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe287\n    cwe613 -->|PEEROF| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe613 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe287,cwe672 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the user logging out, but the session not being properly invalidated (**CWE-613**). This leads to the token remaining active, which then allows an attacker to fetch information as if the user were still logged in, which could be considered **CWE-863** if the application is incorrectly authorizing requests based on the still-valid token.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **Incorrect Access Control** as the root cause. Based on the evidence provided, the logout function **fails to properly invalidate the user's session**, leading to the token remaining active even after logout. This allows an attacker to use the token to fetch information as if the user were still logged in.\n\nThe primary CWE selected is **CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration**. This is because the **root cause** of the vulnerability is the **failure to properly invalidate the session upon logout**. The vulnerability description states \"After a user logs out, their token is still available and fetches information in the logged-in state.\"\n\nThe secondary CWE selected is **CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization**. This is because the token remains active and the system is allowing the attacker to use the token to fetch information as if the user were still logged in.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection. The relationship of CANPRECEDE for CWE-613 to CWE-287 indicates that insufficient session expiration can lead to improper authentication. The relationship of PEEROF for CWE-613 to CWE-863 indicates that insufficient session expiration can be related to incorrect authorization.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-613 is a Base CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-287 (Improper Authentication): While related, this is a more general class of weakness.
