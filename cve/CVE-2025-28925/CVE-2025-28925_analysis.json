The description indicates that CSRF allows for Stored XSS, suggesting a chain where a successful CSRF attack results in the injection of malicious scripts. CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] is thus a secondary weakness resulting from the primary CSRF vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe352 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**, which is then exploited to inject malicious scripts, leading to Stored XSS.\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] - A **weakness** that allows an attacker to force a user to execute unwanted actions.\n2.  **Impact:** CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] - The **impact** of the CSRF vulnerability is the injection of malicious scripts, leading to Stored XSS.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is clearly a **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**, as indicated by the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The description states: \"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Hieu Nguyen WATI Chat and Notification allows Stored XSS.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\". This aligns with CWE-352. The resulting Stored XSS is a consequence of the CSRF, making CWE-79 a secondary weakness. The relationship graph shows that CWE-352 can precede CWE-79.
