  "description": "NetIMAP implements Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) client functionality in Ruby. Prior to versions 0.5.7, 0.4.20, 0.3.9, and 0.2.5, there is a possibility for denial of service by **memory exhaustion** when net-imap reads server responses. At any time while the client is connected, a malicious server can send can send a literal byte count, which is automatically read by the clients receiver thread. The response reader immediately allocates memory for the number of bytes indicated by the server response. This should not be an issue when securely connecting to trusted IMAP servers that are well-behaved. It can affect insecure connections and buggy, untrusted, or compromised servers (for example, connecting to a user supplied hostname). This issue has been patched in versions 0.5.7, 0.4.20, 0.3.9, and 0.2.5.",

  "reference_content": "```text\nRoot cause of vulnerability:\nThe vulnerability is caused by the `net-imap` library's handling of \"literal\" strings in server responses. Specifically, when `Net::IMAP` receives a response containing a literal string, it calls `IO#read` with the size specified in the response.  `IO#read` immediately allocates memory to buffer the entire string before processing continues. There is no limit on the size of literals that will be accepted.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n- Denial of Service (DoS) due to memory exhaustion. An attacker can send a malicious server response with a large literal size, causing the client to allocate excessive memory, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition.\n- The IMAP protocol allows \"literal\" strings to be sent in responses, prefixed with their size in curly braces (e.g. `{1234567890}\\r\\n`).\n- The server does not need to send any more data.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\n- Denial of Service (DoS): The client can exhaust memory resources and become unavailable.\n\nAttack vectors:\n- A malicious or compromised IMAP server can send a crafted response with a large literal string size.\n- Connecting to a user-supplied hostname could be a risk.\n- Insecure connections\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\n- The attacker needs to control or compromise an IMAP server or be able to send crafted responses to an IMAP client.\n\nMitigation or fix:\n- Upgrade to `net-imap` 0.5.7 or later. A configurable `max_response_size` limit has been added.\n- Backports to `net-imap` 0.2.5, 0.3.9, and 0.4.20 are available.\n- Set a `max_response_size` when connecting to untrusted servers or using insecure connections.\n- Users are responsible for adding response handlers to prune excessive unhandled responses.\n```",

A malicious server can send a crafted response with a large literal string size, causing the client to allocate excessive memory.\n\nThe evidence for CWE-770 includes:\n- The vulnerability description states there is a possibility for denial of service by **memory exhaustion** when net-imap reads server responses.\n- The CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicates that `IO#read` immediately allocates memory to buffer the entire string before processing continues.

CWE-400 is too high-level (Class), while CWE-789 is a specific consequence (Variant) of the **unlimited allocation**. The selection of CWE-770 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) because it directly addresses the **lack of limits on resource allocation**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed -
