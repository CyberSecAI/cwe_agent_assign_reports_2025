The root cause is the **improper authorization**, and the impact is arbitrary file access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that there is **improper access control** in Samsung Gallery. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the **root cause of vulnerability** is **improper access control**.\n\nThe guidance provided emphasizes the distinction between authentication and authorization. Since the vulnerability involves controlling access to files *after* the user has been identified, it is an authorization issue.
