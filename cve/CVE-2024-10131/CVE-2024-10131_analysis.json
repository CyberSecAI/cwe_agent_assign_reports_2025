  "description": "The `add_llm` function in `llm_app.py` in infiniflow/ragflow version 0.11.0 contains a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability. The function uses user-supplied input `req[llm_factory]` and `req[llm_name]` to dynamically instantiate classes from various model dictionaries. This approach allows an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code due to the **lack of comprehensive input validation or sanitization**. An attacker could provide a malicious value for llm_factory that, when used as an index to these model dictionaries, results in the execution of arbitrary code.",
