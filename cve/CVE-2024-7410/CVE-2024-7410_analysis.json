  "description": "The My Custom CSS PHP & ADS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 3.3. This is due the plugin not preventing direct access to the /my-custom-css/vendor/mobiledetect/mobiledetectlib/export/exportToJSON.php file and and the file displaying/generating the full path. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7410:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of access control on the `exportToJSON.php` file within the My Custom CSS PHP & ADS WordPress plugin. This file is directly accessible via a web request.\n*   The `exportToJSON.php` script, when accessed, outputs the full server path where the WordPress installation resides.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Full Path Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the full server path due to the lack of access control on `exportToJSON.php`. The script is designed to export data and in doing so, discloses the file path.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Information Leakage:** An attacker can obtain the full server path of the WordPress installation.\n*   **Aid for Further Attacks:** The full path information can be used to assist attackers in crafting more specific and targeted attacks. It reveals the directory structure, which can help them locate vulnerable files, configuration details, and other sensitive information on the server.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Direct HTTP Request:** An attacker can simply make an HTTP request to the vulnerable file (`/my-custom-css/vendor/mobiledetect/mobiledetectlib/export/exportToJSON.php`).\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **No authentication needed:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to the WordPress site or have any prior access.\n*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be external and access the vulnerable file remotely.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the \"My Custom CSS PHP & ADS\" plugin up to and including version 3.3.\n*   The disclosed path information, on its own, is not directly exploitable but serves as an important piece of information for planning other attacks.\n*   The Wordfence article states there is no patch available and suggests removing the plugin as a solution.",

While other CWEs like CWE-425 Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') were considered due to the direct access of the file, the primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive information, specifically the full path. CWE-200 is a direct result of **missing** access control, leading to the information disclosure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Sent Data\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|PEEROF| cwe201\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing** access control on the `exportToJSON.php` file, leading to the direct request being possible, and ultimately resulting in the exposure of the full path.\n\nMissing Access Control -> Direct Request -> Information Exposure (Full Path Disclosure)\n\n*   **Root Cause:** Missing access control on the file\n*   **Weakness:** Exposure of sensitive information\n*   **Impact:** Full Path Disclosure, aiding further attacks\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting impact. The primary weakness is clearly the exposure of sensitive information (full path). The evidence is strong, directly stating that the file displays/generates the full path, making it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve it. The graph relationships helped confirm that CWE-200 is a suitable choice, especially considering its peer relationship with CWE-201, which involves inserting sensitive information into sent data, which is very similar.
