While CWE-285 is a broader category, its presence indicates an authorization problem that leads to the exposure of sensitive information. Additionally, CWE-200 is often a consequence of authorization flaws. CWE-200 is a Class level and is discouraged, however, it is used as the final impact, while CWE-285 is the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe200 <--|CANFOLLOW| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Authorization** (CWE-285), which then leads to the **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting impact of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description mentions \"Accessing Functionality Not Properly Constrained by ACLs\" and \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states that the vulnerability allows a malicious actor to view sensitive information normally unavailable.\n\nThe primary CWE, CWE-200, was initially considered due to the explicit mention of \"Exposure of Sensitive Information.\" However, the root cause is the **\"Accessing Functionality Not Properly Constrained by ACLs.\"** This points to an authorization issue.\n\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization) was then considered as the root cause, leading to CWE-200 as the impact.
