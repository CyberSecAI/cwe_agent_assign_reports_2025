  "description": "A vulnerability was found in cjbi wetech-cms 1.0/1.1/1.2 and classified as critical. This issue affects the function searchTopicByKeyword of the file wetech-cms-master\\wetech-core\\src\\main\\java\\tech\\wetech\\cms\\dao\\TopicDao.java. The manipulation of the argument keyword leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or parameterization of user-supplied input within the `TopicDao.java` file of the `wetech-cms` project. Specifically, the `keyword` parameter in the `/keyword/{id}` route is directly incorporated into an SQL query without adequate escaping or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the direct inclusion of user-controlled data into an SQL query, which enables an attacker to manipulate the query's structure and logic.\n*  **Lack of Input Validation:** The system fails to validate or sanitize the input received for the keyword parameter.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive database information, including database names, table names, and stored data. As shown in the example, the attacker was able to extract the database name.\n*   **Potential for Data Modification or Deletion:** Depending on the database user privileges, an attacker could potentially modify or delete data. This is not demonstrated in the provided content, but is a typical risk of SQL injection.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted GET request to the `/keyword/{id}` endpoint.\n*   **Malicious Input:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `keyword` parameter of the URL.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the target application to send HTTP requests.\n*   **Understanding of SQL Syntax:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft the injection payloads.\n*   **Knowledge of the Application's API:** Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and its parameter is required.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is demonstrated through a crafted SQL payload injected into the `keyword` parameter.\n*   The provided python script automates the extraction of database name using blind SQL injection techniques by measuring the response lengths.\n*   The vulnerable code resides in `wetech-cms-master\\wetech-core\\src\\main\\java\\tech\\wetech\\cms\\dao\\TopicDao.java`\n\nIn summary, the provided content demonstrates a classic SQL injection vulnerability in `wetech-cms` due to unsanitized user input in SQL queries. It provides details on the attack vector, payload construction, and a python script to automate exploitation and data extraction.",

The vulnerability description clearly states that the manipulation of the argument keyword leads to **sql injection**, which aligns precisely with CWE-89's description of **improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command**. Other CWEs, while potentially related in broader contexts (e.g., CWE-79 for Cross-site Scripting as a potential impact), do not accurately represent the root cause. Therefore, a direct mapping to CWE-89 is the most appropriate and specific classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe78 -->|PEEROF| cwe89\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe78 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization of special elements** in the SQL command (CWE-89). The user-supplied input `keyword` is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization. This leads to the execution of malicious SQL code, potentially resulting in information disclosure, data modification, or deletion.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on clear evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The vulnerability description explicitly states the presence of an **SQL injection** vulnerability due to the manipulation of the `keyword` argument, which directly corresponds to CWE-89. The evidence also includes technical details about the vulnerable function, the attack vector, and the potential impact, all reinforcing the identification of CWE-89 as the most appropriate classification. The Retriever Results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the primary weakness. The selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
