# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-37317

## Vulnerability Description
The Nextcloud Notes app is a distraction free notes taking app for Nextcloud. If an attacker managed to share a folder called `Notes/` with a newly created user before they logged in, the Notes app would use that folder store the personal notes. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Notes app is upgraded to 4.9.3.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-37317:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Nextcloud Notes app incorrectly handles the creation of the notes folder when a user has a pre-existing shared folder with the name "Notes/". Specifically, if an attacker shares a folder named `Notes/` with a newly created user before that user logs in for the first time, the Notes app will incorrectly use that pre-existing shared folder as the designated storage location for the user's personal notes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Folder Handling:** The core weakness lies in the Notes app not properly verifying or handling pre-existing shared folders with the same name as the default notes folder. It lacks proper checks to ensure it creates a new folder for notes rather than using a shared folder
*   **Missing Access Control:** The application fails to enforce proper access controls and implicitly trusts a shared folder when it should create a new directory within the user's storage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker who can create a shared folder before a new user logs in can potentially access the victim's notes as they are stored in a location controlled by the attacker.
*   **Integrity Violation:** The attacker could also manipulate the victim's notes, as they would have write access to the shared folder.
*   **Availability Impact:** The attacker may cause issues with the expected behavior of the notes application, depending on how they choose to exploit the access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network by sharing the specifically named folder with a targeted newly created user.
*   **Shared folder:** The attack vector involves exploiting the shared folder mechanism of nextcloud.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Nextcloud User:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the same Nextcloud instance.
*   **Share Permissions:** The attacker must have the permission to share folders within the Nextcloud instance.
*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to share the "Notes/" folder with the victim before the victim logs in for the first time and the Notes app attempts to create the folder, exploiting a race condition of sorts.
*  **Low Privilege:** The attacker requires only low privileges to exploit this.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability is rated as moderate.
*   The issue was fixed in version 4.9.3 of the Nextcloud Notes app.
*   The provided github content references a pull request that was intended to fix issues related to folder creation, but didn't fully fix the issue related to pre-existing shared folders.
