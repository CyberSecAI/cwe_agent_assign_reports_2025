  "description": "Backstage is an open framework for building developer portals. An attacker with control of the contents of the TechDocs storage buckets is able to inject executable scripts in the TechDocs content that will be executed in the victims browser when browsing documentation or navigating to an attacker provided link. This has been fixed in the 1.10.13 release of the `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-backend` package. users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization or escaping of user-controlled content within the `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-backend` package when rendering documentation. This allows an attacker to inject executable scripts into TechDocs content.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is a form of stored XSS.  The system fails to adequately sanitize user-controlled input that's stored in the TechDocs storage buckets.\n*   **Inadequate Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize or escape content before rendering it, resulting in the execution of malicious scripts.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.\n*   **Data Theft:** The attacker could potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.\n*   **Account Compromise:** If the attacker steals a session token, they can impersonate the victim and perform actions within the application on their behalf.\n*   **Malware Delivery:** It's possible to redirect the user to malicious sites, or to inject malicious code leading to malware delivery.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **TechDocs Storage Bucket Control:** The attacker needs to have control over the contents of the TechDocs storage buckets (where the documentation is stored) to inject malicious content. This could occur if an attacker has gained access to the storage, or has found an alternative way to alter content.\n*   **Victim Browsing Documentation:** The malicious script is executed when a victim views the compromised documentation within the TechDocs interface, or navigates to a specially crafted link controlled by the attacker.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Access to TechDocs Storage:**  The attacker needs to be able to modify content in the storage location that contains the TechDocs data. This would require some form of access to the storage bucket, and the ability to manipulate data within.\n*   **Knowledge of the Target System:** The attacker needs to be aware of how TechDocs processes data in order to inject exploitable code.\n*   **Victim Interaction:** The attack requires the victim to browse the malicious documentation or navigate to a malicious link.\n\n**Additional Details from the Content:**\n\n*   **Affected Package:** `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-backend`\n*   **Affected Versions:**  Versions prior to 1.10.13\n*   **Patched Version:** 1.10.13\n*   **CVSS Score:** 6.5 (Moderate)\n*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L\n*   **CWE:** CWE-693",

CWE-79 has several parent and child relationships, but none seem to fit the vulnerability description better. CWE-116 is a Class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-79, but CWE-79 is more specific, making it a better fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe116\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe116 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the attacker gaining control of TechDocs storage buckets. This leads to the injection of malicious scripts into the TechDocs content. When a victim browses the documentation, the script is executed, resulting in a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which indicates a stored XSS vulnerability. The **root cause** is the **lack of proper sanitization or escaping of user-controlled content**. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts, which are then executed when a user views the documentation. The selection of CWE-79 is optimal because it directly addresses the improper neutralization of input during web page generation, leading to XSS.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**CWE-79** is selected as the primary CWE because the **root cause** of this vulnerability is the **improper neutralization of user-controllable input** before it is placed in the output used as a web page, which leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).\n*   **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**: impact: execute scripts\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization or escaping of user-controlled content within the `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-backend` package when rendering documentation. This allows an attacker to inject executable scripts into TechDocs content.\n*   **Retriever Results**: High similarity score and Allowed usage.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**CWE-116** is considered as a secondary CWE because the **lack of proper sanitization or escaping** is a form of improper encoding or escaping of output. However, CWE-79 is more specific to XSS.\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**: The vulnerability stems from a **lack of proper sanitization or escaping** of user-controlled content within the `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-backend` package when rendering documentation. This allows an attacker to inject executable scripts into TechDocs content.\n*   **Retriever Results**: High similarity score but Allowed-with-Review usage, suggesting a more specific CWE might be appropriate.\n\n### Other CWEs Considered but Not Used\n\n*   CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection'): While injection is a broad category, XSS (CWE-79) is a more specific type of injection that directly applies to this vulnerability.\n*   CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'): This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not related to path manipulation.\n*   CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'): Code Injection is too broad; the specific issue is XSS.\n*   CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine: Potentially relevant if a template engine was involved, but the description doesn't explicitly state this.\n*   CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check: This is not relevant as the vulnerability is not related to downloading code.\n*   CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'): This is not relevant as there is no OS command injection.\n*   CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path: This is not relevant as the vulnerability is not related to file names or paths.\n*   CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection'): Not relevant because there is no evidence of expression language injection.",
