## Vulnerability Description
Backstage is an open framework for building developer portals. An attacker with control of the contents of the TechDocs storage buckets is able to inject executable scripts in the TechDocs content that will be executed in the victims browser when browsing documentation or navigating to an attacker provided link. This has been fixed in the 1.10.13 release of the `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-backend` package. users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** execute scripts
- **vector:** control of TechDocs storage buckets
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** @backstage/plugin-techdocs-backend
- **version:** before 1.10.13

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization or escaping of user-controlled content within the `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-backend` package when rendering documentation. This allows an attacker to inject executable scripts into TechDocs content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is a form of stored XSS.  The system fails to adequately sanitize user-controlled input that's stored in the TechDocs storage buckets.
*   **Inadequate Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize or escape content before rendering it, resulting in the execution of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
*   **Data Theft:** The attacker could potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
*   **Account Compromise:** If the attacker steals a session token, they can impersonate the victim and perform actions within the application on their behalf.
*   **Malware Delivery:** It's possible to redirect the user to malicious sites, or to inject malicious code leading to malware delivery.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **TechDocs Storage Bucket Control:** The attacker needs to have control over the contents of the TechDocs storage buckets (where the documentation is stored) to inject malicious content. This could occur if an attacker has gained access to the storage, or has found an alternative way to alter content.
*   **Victim Browsing Documentation:** The malicious script is executed when a victim views the compromised documentation within the TechDocs interface, or navigates to a specially crafted link controlled by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to TechDocs Storage:**  The attacker needs to be able to modify content in the storage location that contains the TechDocs data. This would require some form of access to the storage bucket, and the ability to manipulate data within.
*   **Knowledge of the Target System:** The attacker needs to be aware of how TechDocs processes data in order to inject exploitable code.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The attack requires the victim to browse the malicious documentation or navigate to a malicious link.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Affected Package:** `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-backend`
*   **Affected Versions:**  Versions prior to 1.10.13
*   **Patched Version:** 1.10.13
*   **CVSS Score:** 6.5 (Moderate)
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L
*   **CWE:** CWE-693
