# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-35230

## Vulnerability Description
GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that allows users to share and edit geospatial data. In affected versions the welcome and about page includes version and revision information about the software in use (including library and components used). This information is sensitive from a security point of view because it allows software used by the server to be easily identified. This issue has been patched in version 2.26.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper access control**
- **impact:** information disclosure
- **product:** GeoServer
- **version:** before 2.26.0
- **component:** welcome and about page

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to CVE-2024-35230.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The welcome and about pages of GeoServer display version and revision information, including details about the software and libraries used. This information disclosure can be used by attackers to identify vulnerable software components and plan targeted attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: The software exposes sensitive version information in its welcome page footer and about page, which can be accessed by unauthenticated users. This violates the principle of least privilege and makes it easier to identify potentially vulnerable software.
- Lack of Access Control: The version and build information is visible to all users, regardless of their authentication status or privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can identify the exact version of GeoServer and its components running on the server.
- This allows attackers to target known vulnerabilities specific to the identified versions.
- This makes it easier for attackers to plan and execute more effective attacks by exploiting known weaknesses in the components.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network Access: An attacker can access the vulnerable information through HTTP requests.
- Specifically, the welcome page footer and the about page (accessible to anyone) expose the information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No special privileges or authentication is required.
- Attacker needs network access to the GeoServer instance

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| No identity check (no login)                               | CWE-306        |
| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
