  "description": "An issue was discovered on the Forvia Hella HELLA Driving Recorder DR 820. Managing Settings and Obtaining Sensitive Data and Sabotaging the Car Battery can be performed by unauthorized parties. After bypassing the device pairing, an attacker can obtain sensitive user and vehicle information through the settings interface. Remote attackers can modify power management settings, disable recording, delete stored footage, and turn off battery protection, leading to potential denial-of-service conditions and vehicle battery drainage.",

Attackers can lower the dashcam volume while executing remote commands to avoid detection. Additionally, they can turn off battery protection, causing the dashcam to drain the vehicle\u2019s battery when parked overnight. Remote attackers can also delete recorded footage that may serve as evidence, disable recording discreetly, or even perform a factory reset, leading to a complete loss of stored data.\nAttack vectors: The attack requires a connection to the dashcam.\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to connect to the dashcam.\nMitigation or fix: NOINFO\n```",
