  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-45801', description='DOMPurify is a DOM-only, super-fast, uber-tolerant **XSS** sanitizer for HTML, MathML and SVG. It has been discovered that malicious HTML using special nesting techniques can bypass the depth checking added to DOMPurify in recent releases. It was also possible to use Prototype Pollution to weaken the depth check. This renders dompurify unable to avoid cross site scripting (**XSS**) attacks. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.5.4 and 3.1.3 of DOMPurify. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.', key_phrases={'rootcause': '', 'weakness': ['XSS', 'cross-site scripting'], 'impact': 'bypass depth check', 'vector': 'malicious HTML', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'DOMPurify', 'version': 'before 2.5.4 and 3.1.3', 'component': ''}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-45801\\n\\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\\n- The vulnerability stems from a combination of two weaknesses:\\n    1.  Malicious HTML using special nesting techniques can bypass the depth checking mechanism implemented in DOMPurify.\\n    2.  Prototype pollution could be used to weaken the depth check, making it ineffective.\\n- This combination could allow attackers to bypass DOMPurify's sanitization and execute Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n- **Bypass of Depth Checking:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the depth-checking mechanism implemented to prevent excessive nesting, which can lead to mXSS.\\n- **Prototype Pollution:** The vulnerability is further exacerbated by the ability to use prototype pollution to weaken the depth check.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n- **XSS Attack:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows attackers to inject and execute malicious scripts in the context of the vulnerable application, leading to XSS.\\n- **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability**: Specifically, this can result in a low impact to confidentiality, high impact to integrity and low impact to availability.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- **Network:** The attack vector is via the network, meaning the attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability.\\n- **Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is considered high.\\n- The attacker needs to craft specific malicious HTML with special nesting techniques and possibly use prototype pollution to weaken the depth check\\n\\n**Additional Information:**\\n- **Affected Versions:** Versions of `dompurify` prior to 2.5.4 and 3.1.3 are affected.\\n- **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in versions 2.5.4 and 3.1.3 of `dompurify`.\\n- **Fix Commit:** The fix was implemented in commit [1e52026](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/commit/1e520262bf4c66b5efda49e2316d6d1246ca7b21) (3.x branch) and [26e1d69](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/commit/26e1d69ca7f769f5c558619d644d90dd8bf26ebc) (2.x branch).\\n- **CWE:** CWE-1321\\n\\nThis analysis provides a detailed understanding of the vulnerability, its causes, impact, and how it can be exploited, which aligns with the information provided in the GitHub Security Advisory.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '79', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:bypass depth check', 'keyphrase': 'bypass depth check', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'vector:malicious HTML', 'keyphrase': 'malicious HTML', 'type': 'vector'}, {'id': 'product:DOMPurify', 'keyphrase': 'DOMPurify', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:before 2.5.4 and 3.1.3', 'keyphrase': 'before 2.5.4 and 3.1.3', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(492.6172649604515)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '1321', 'name': \"Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product receives input from an upstream component that specifies attributes that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control modifications of attributes of the object prototype.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:bypass depth check', 'keyphrase': 'bypass depth check', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'vector:malicious HTML', 'keyphrase': 'malicious HTML', 'type': 'vector'}, {'id': 'product:DOMPurify', 'keyphrase': 'DOMPurify', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:before 2.5.4 and 3.1.3', 'keyphrase': 'before 2.5.4 and 3.1.3', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(471.6514820876299)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    DOMPurify is a DOM-only, super-fast, uber-tolerant **XSS** sanitizer for HTML, MathML and SVG. It has been discovered that malicious HTML using special nesting techniques can bypass the depth checking added to DOMPurify in recent releases. It was also possible to use Prototype Pollution to weaken the depth check. This renders dompurify unable to avoid cross site scripting (**XSS**) attacks. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.5.4 and 3.1.3 of DOMPurify. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## WEAKNESS: 'XSS'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1.
