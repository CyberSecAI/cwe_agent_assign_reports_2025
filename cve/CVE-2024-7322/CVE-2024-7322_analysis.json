The vulnerability description indicates a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, which aligns with the impact of uncontrolled resource consumption. CWE-799 **Improper Control of Interaction Frequency** is also considered, as the vulnerability involves an unsolicited encrypted rejoin response.

This change in node ID results in a denial-of-service (DoS). The root cause is the **improper handling** or validation of the unsolicited rejoin response, leading to **uncontrolled resource consumption**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness identified is CWE-400 **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**, as the vulnerability results in a denial-of-service condition due to a change in node ID upon receiving an unsolicited encrypted rejoin response. This DoS condition directly relates to the consumption of resources, rendering the ZigBee device unusable until the network is re-established. While CWE-799 **Improper Control of Interaction Frequency** is a plausible secondary candidate, CWE-400 aligns more directly with the described impact.
