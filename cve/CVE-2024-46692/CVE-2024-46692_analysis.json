  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved firmware qcom scm Mark get_wq_ctx() as atomic call Currently get_wq_ctx() is wrongly configured as a standard call. When two SMC calls are in sleep and one SMC wakes up, it calls get_wq_ctx() to resume the corresponding sleeping thread. But if get_wq_ctx() is interrupted, goes to sleep and another SMC call is waiting to be allocated a waitq context, it leads to a deadlock. To avoid this get_wq_ctx() must be an atomic call and cant be a standard SMC call. Hence mark get_wq_ctx() as a fast call.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe `get_wq_ctx()` function, used for resuming sleeping threads after an SMC (Secure Monitor Call), was incorrectly configured as a standard call instead of an atomic (fast) call.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Non-atomic operation:** The `get_wq_ctx()` function was vulnerable to interruption. If it was interrupted and went to sleep, another SMC call could potentially attempt to allocate a wait queue context, leading to a deadlock.\n- **Incorrect call configuration:** The function was set up as a standard SMC call when it required the properties of a fast/atomic call.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Deadlock:** The primary consequence of this vulnerability is a deadlock situation, where multiple SMC calls are blocked indefinitely, halting the system or specific processes that rely on SMC calls.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Multiple concurrent SMC calls:** The vulnerability can be triggered by having multiple simultaneous SMC calls that involve sleeping and resuming threads using wait queues. Specifically, the scenario involves one SMC call waking up and calling `get_wq_ctx()`, while another SMC call is waiting to allocate a wait queue context.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs the capability to trigger multiple concurrent SMC calls that involve sleeping and resuming threads. This would typically require some level of access to the system and the ability to execute code that performs SMC calls.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The fix involves changing the `get_wq_ctx()` function to use `ARM_SMCCC_FAST_CALL` instead of `ARM_SMCCC_STD_CALL`. This ensures that the call is atomic and cannot be interrupted, thus preventing the deadlock.\n- The vulnerability is in the Qualcomm System Control Manager (SCM) driver within the Linux kernel.\n- The patch addresses the issue by marking the function as a fast call. This change prevents the described scenario from causing a deadlock.\n- The fix was backported to stable kernel branches.",

CWE-667 (Improper Locking) and CWE-362 (Race Condition) are related as potential root causes that could lead to a deadlock. CWE-667 is a class-level CWE, suggesting that more specific base-level CWEs related to locking might exist. CWE-362 is also a class-level CWE, pointing to a potential race condition that contributes to the deadlock. The relationship analysis highlights the chain of events: improper synchronization (CWE-362) or locking (CWE-667) leads to a deadlock (CWE-833).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe833[\"CWE-833: Deadlock\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n\n    cwe667 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe833\n    cwe362 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe833\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe833 primary\n    class cwe667,cwe362 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect configuration of `get_wq_ctx()` as a standard call**, leading to potential race conditions or improper locking. This ultimately results in a deadlock.\n- **Root Cause:** Incorrect configuration of `get_wq_ctx()`\n- **Weakness:** Potential Race Condition (CWE-362) or Improper Locking (CWE-667)\n- **Impact:** Deadlock (CWE-833)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the deadlock as the most direct impact of the vulnerability. The analysis was then refined to incorporate the potential root causes, namely the improper locking or race condition resulting from the **incorrect configuration of the function**. The evidence for this is explicitly stated in the vulnerability description: \"**wrong configuration of get_wq_ctx() as a standard call**\" which \"leads to a deadlock.\" The Retriever results also suggest considering CWE-667 and CWE-362, further supporting the analysis.\nThe selection of CWE-833 as the primary CWE is justified because the vulnerability description directly states that the issue leads to a deadlock. While CWE-667 and CWE-362 are plausible contributing factors, they are less directly stated in the description and are at a higher level of abstraction. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-833 being a Base CWE and CWE-667 and CWE-362 being Class CWEs that represent potential contributing factors.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-833: Deadlock\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
