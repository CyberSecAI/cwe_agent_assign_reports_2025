  "query": "A vulnerability in the logging subsystem of Cisco Meeting Management could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive information in clear text on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to improper storage of sensitive information within the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive data that is stored on the affected device.",
