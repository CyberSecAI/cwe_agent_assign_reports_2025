  "description": "Navidrome is an open source web-based music collection server and streamer. Starting in version 0.52.0 and prior to version 0.54.5, in certain Subsonic API endpoints, a flaw in the authentication check process allows an attacker to specify any arbitrary username that does not exist on the system, along with a salted hash of an empty password. Under these conditions, Navidrome treats the request as authenticated, granting access to various Subsonic endpoints without requiring valid credentials. An attacker can use any non-existent username to bypass the authentication system and gain access to various read-only data in Navidrome, such as user playlists. However, any attempt to modify data fails with a permission denied error due to insufficient permissions, limiting the impact to unauthorized viewing of information. Version 0.54.5 contains a patch for this issue.",

Any attempt to modify data fails due to insufficient permissions, limiting the impact to unauthorized viewing of information.\n- Attack vectors: The attacker sends a request to a Subsonic API endpoint, specifying a non-existent username, the MD5 hash of an empty password, and the salt used to generate that hash.\n- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the Navidrome server.\n- Mitigation or fix: Upgrade to version 0.54.5 or later.

Given that the vulnerability involves a **flaw in the authentication check process** that allows an attacker to bypass authentication, CWE-287 is the most appropriate. CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) was considered as a secondary weakness, since the attacker gets access to read-only data.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **flaw in the authentication check process** (CWE-287). This allows an attacker to bypass the authentication system. As a result of this bypass, the attacker gains unauthorized access to read-only data, indicating a potential missing authorization check (CWE-862), even though the primary issue lies in authentication.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nMy assessment is strongly based on the provided evidence, which includes the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The key phrase \"flaw in authentication check process\" directly points to an authentication issue, making CWE-287 the primary candidate. The retriever results also support this, with CWE-287 being among the top-ranked CWEs.\n\nThe hierarchical relationship between CWE-287 and CWE-306 was carefully considered. While CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) could be applicable if there was absolutely no authentication, the description specifies a **flaw in the authentication check process**, which aligns better with the broader scope of CWE-287.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-287 is a Class-level CWE, which is appropriate given the information available. A more specific Base-level CWE could be considered if more details about the exact nature of the authentication flaw were available.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
