## Vulnerability Description
IrfanView DXF File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Read Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24619.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of DXF files in IrfanView. This leads to a read operation past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The software reads data beyond the allocated buffer.
- Improper input validation: The application fails to validate user-supplied data within DXF files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current IrfanView process.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious file: An attacker can craft a malicious DXF file.
- Malicious page: An attacker can lure the victim to a malicious page hosting the malicious DXF file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious DXF file to a user of IrfanView.
- User interaction is required for exploitation as the user has to open the malicious DXF file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in IrfanView version 4.70 with plugins version 4.70.
