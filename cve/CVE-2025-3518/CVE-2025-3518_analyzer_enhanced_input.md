## Vulnerability Description
It technically possible for a user to upload a file to a conversation despite the file upload functionality being disabled. The file upload functionality can be enabled or disabled for specific use cases through configuration. In case the functionality is disabled for at least one use case, the system nevertheless allows files to be uploaded through direct API requests. During the upload file, interception and allowed file type rules are still applied correctly. If file sharing is generally enabled, this issue is not of concern.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-3518 based on provided content:

**1. Verification:**

The content directly references CVE-2025-3518 and provides details related to a vulnerability. Therefore, the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The file upload functionality can be bypassed even when disabled due to improper configuration handling. Specifically, the API accepts file upload requests even when the functionality is disabled in certain use cases.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper configuration management, insufficient input validation, and potential bypass of security controls.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Users can upload files to a conversation even when the file upload functionality is intended to be disabled. While file interceptors and allowed file type checks are still in place, this bypass allows for potential unauthorized file uploads.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker can exploit the API to upload files directly, bypassing the intended UI restrictions.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send API requests to the Unblu server.  Low privilege level is sufficient.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** Upgrade to Unblu Spark (v8) 8.13.1 or later, or Unblu Spark (v7) 7.54.1 or later.
*   **Severity:** 5.3 Medium (CVSS v4.0)
*   **Credits:** Andrei Dabrakou, Citadelo
