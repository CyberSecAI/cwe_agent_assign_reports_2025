# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-52590

## Description

Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. In affected versions **missing validation in `ApRequestService.signedGet`** allows an attacker to create fake user profiles that appear to be from a different instance than the one where they actually exist. These profiles can be used to impersonate existing users from the target instance. Vulnerable Misskey instances will accept spoofed users as valid, allowing an attacker to impersonate users on another instance. Attackers have full control of the spoofed user and can post, renote, or otherwise interact like a real account. This issue has been addressed in version 2024.11.0-alpha.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship considered was the parent-child relationship between CWE-285 and its potential children. While CWE-285 is a high-level class, the information provided doesn't give enough information to go to a more specific child. CWE-290 and CWE-639 were also considered, but deemed secondary because they are more specific types of authorization bypasses.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing validation** in `ApRequestService.signedGet`, leading to **improper authorization**. This allows an attacker to create fake user profiles, impersonate users, and interact as a real account.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on the **missing validation** aspect as the root cause. The primary CWE selected is CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**), because there is **missing validation** in `ApRequestService.signedGet`. From the vulnerability description: "In affected versions **missing validation in `ApRequestService.signedGet`** allows an attacker to create fake user profiles that appear to be from a different instance than the one where they actually exist. These profiles can be used to impersonate existing users from the target instance."

CWE-290 (**Authentication Bypass by Spoofing**) was considered because the attacker is creating fake profiles and impersonating users, which is a form of spoofing. However, the root cause is the **missing validation**, not necessarily a flaw in the authentication scheme itself.

CWE-639 (**Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key**) was considered because the attacker is essentially modifying user profiles to gain access. However, this is a consequence of the **missing validation**, not the primary weakness.

CWE-285 is a Class-level CWE, and the guidance discourages its use if more specific CWEs are available. However, based on the available evidence, a more specific CWE cannot be selected.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
This attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
