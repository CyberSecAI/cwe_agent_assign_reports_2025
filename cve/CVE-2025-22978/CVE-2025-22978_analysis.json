  "reference_content": "CVE-2025-22978: PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval\n\nThe provided content **relates** to a vulnerability.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability is due to the lack of filtering formulas when inserting logs, specifically in the exception log download module (eladmin-2.7\\eladmin-2.7\\eladmin-logging\\src\\main\\java\\me\\zhengjie\\rest\\SysLogController.java).\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nCSV/XLSX injection.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nMay lead to information leakage and other issues arising from formula parsing.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nClicking on a crafted formula within a downloaded log file. The attacker can inject formulas into the log, which are then parsed when the log is viewed, potentially leading to information disclosure.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nThe attacker needs to be able to trigger the creation of an exception log containing a malicious formula.  The issue description implies the attacker can influence the log content.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\nFilter out formulas when inserting the logs. The issue references [https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/CSV_Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/CSV_Injection) as a resource for understanding the vulnerability and potential mitigations.\n\n**Additional details (more than official CVE description):**\n- Affected version: <= 2.7\n- The vulnerability is reproducible by logging in with a specific username.\n- The vulnerability allows reading the first two lines of a column when the formula is parsed.\n- The issue is demonstrated with screenshots showing the injected formula and the resulting data retrieval.",

The vulnerability is due to the lack of filtering formulas when inserting logs. |\n| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. While not the primary issue, XSS could arise if the CSV content is later displayed on a web page without proper neutralization. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influences the selection is the direct match of the vulnerability description to **CWE-1236** Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File. The vulnerability involves a **weakness** where user-provided information is saved into a CSV file without proper neutralization of special elements that could be interpreted as commands. This aligns perfectly with the description of **CWE-1236**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1236[\"CWE-1236: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -->|PEEROF| cwe1236\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1236 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of formula elements when writing to a CSV file (**CWE-1236**). This leads to the potential for the execution of arbitrary commands or information leakage when the CSV file is opened in a spreadsheet application. A secondary impact could involve cross-site scripting (**CWE-79**) if the CSV data is later displayed on a web page without proper encoding.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly supports the selection of **CWE-1236** Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File as the primary CWE. The evidence from the vulnerability description, including the \"Root cause of vulnerability\" section, clearly indicates that the lack of filtering formulas when inserting logs is the root cause. The retriever results also show a high similarity score for **CWE-1236**.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-1236** is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **weakness** of **improper neutralization** of formula elements in CSV files. While other CWEs like **CWE-79** Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') could be considered as secondary issues if the CSV data were to be displayed on a web page, the primary **weakness** lies in the **improper handling** of CSV data. The evidence states \"The vulnerability is due to the lack of filtering formulas when inserting logs\".\n\n**CWE-79** was considered as a secondary potential issue, but it's not the primary root cause. It could be relevant if the CSV data is later displayed on a web page without proper encoding, leading to XSS.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1236: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product saves user-provided information into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as a command when the file is opened by a spreadsheet product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
