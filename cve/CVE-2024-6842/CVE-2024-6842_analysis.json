This leads to CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) as a secondary consequence. While CWE-200 is discouraged as a primary mapping, it accurately describes the impact of the **missing authentication**. The relationship is hierarchical in that CWE-306 is the root cause that *allows* the information exposure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|CAUSED_BY| cwe306\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing authentication** (CWE-306) at the `/setup-complete` API endpoint. This **allows unauthorized access** to the `currentSettings` function, which then **results in the exposure of sensitive information**, such as API keys (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identifies CWE-306 as the primary weakness due to the **missing authentication** on the `/setup-complete` endpoint. This directly allows unauthorized users to access sensitive information. The secondary weakness is CWE-200, which describes the impact of this **missing authentication**. The evidence supports this classification, as the vulnerability description explicitly states that unauthorized users can access sensitive system settings because of the **lack of authentication**.\n\nI am overriding the general mapping guidance that discourages using CWE-200 as a primary mapping because, in this instance, it is a direct consequence of the **missing authentication**. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-306 is a Base level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
