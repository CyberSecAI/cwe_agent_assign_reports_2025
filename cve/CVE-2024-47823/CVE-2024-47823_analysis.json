  "description": "Livewire is a full-stack framework for Laravel that allows for dynamic UI components without leaving PHP. In livewire/livewire prior to `2.12.7` and `v3.5.2`, the **file extension of an uploaded file is guessed based on the MIME type**. As a result, the actual file extension from the file name is not validated. An attacker can therefore bypass the validation by uploading a file with a valid MIME type (e.g., `image/png`) and a .php file extension. If the following criteria are met, the attacker can carry out an RCE attack 1. Filename is composed of the original file name using `$file->getClientOriginalName()`. 2. Files stored directly on your server in a public storage disk. 3. Webserver is configured to execute .php files. This issue has been addressed in release versions `2.12.7` and `3.5.2`. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

CWE-646 provides a more specific Variant related to the reliance on filename or extension. The weakness is rooted in **guessing the file extension based on MIME type**, highlighting the reliance issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    cwe646[\"CWE-646: Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File\"]\n    \n    cwe646 -->|PEEROF| cwe434\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe434 primary\n    class cwe646 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **guessing of the file extension based on the MIME type (CWE-434)**. This leads to a bypass of validation because the actual file extension is not checked. An attacker then uploads a file with a manipulated extension (e.g., .php) and a valid MIME type (e.g., image/png). If the server is configured to execute PHP files and the application uses the original filename when storing the file, the attacker can achieve remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points to CWE-434 because the **root cause** involves the unrestricted upload of a file with a dangerous type. The vulnerability description clearly states that the **file extension is guessed based on the MIME type**, which allows an attacker to upload a file with a `.php` extension. This bypasses the validation process and can lead to remote code execution. CWE-646 is a closely related weakness because the vulnerability relies on the file name and extension.\n\nThe evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section supports this analysis: \"The file extension of an uploaded file was being guessed based on the MIME type instead of using the actual file extension from the file name.\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-434 is a Base level weakness that directly addresses the vulnerability, while CWE-646 provides additional context.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')): While RCE is an impact, the root cause is not XSS, so it's not the right fit.\n*   CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')): Path traversal isn't directly involved.\n*   CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')): Code injection is a potential impact, but the root cause is the unrestricted upload.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-646: Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows a file to be uploaded, but it relies on the file name or extension of the file to determine the appropriate behaviors.
