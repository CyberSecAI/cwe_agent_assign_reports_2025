While CWE-522 was a candidate, the vulnerability description specifically mentions \"cleartext password,\" making CWE-256 a more precise and appropriate choice. CWE-200 is also considered as a potential impact, but it's a high-level class and discouraged as a root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe256 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n    class cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Plaintext Storage of a Password (CWE-256)**. This leads to **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200)**, as the stored password can be easily retrieved and misused. The cleartext storage is the root cause, and the information disclosure is the direct impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis considered several CWEs related to information exposure and credential protection. However, the explicit mention of \"cleartext password\" in the vulnerability description and the CVE summary strongly suggests that **CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password)** is the most appropriate primary CWE. This is because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability. While **CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor)** is a valid concern as a consequence of the vulnerability, it is discouraged as a root cause. The relationship graph also supports the selection of CWE-256 as it is more specific than its parent, CWE-522, and can precede CWE-200.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
