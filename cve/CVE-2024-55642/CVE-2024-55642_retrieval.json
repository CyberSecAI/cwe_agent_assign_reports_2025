  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-55642', description='In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved block Prevent **potential deadlocks** in zone write plug error recovery Zone write plugging for handling writes to zones of a zoned block device always execute a zone report whenever a write BIO to a zone fails. The intent of this is to ensure that the tracking of a zone write pointer is always correct to ensure that the alignment to a zone write pointer of write BIOs can be checked on submission and that we can always correctly emulate zone append operations using regular write BIOs. However, this error recovery scheme introduces a potential deadlock if a device queue freeze is initiated while BIOs are still plugged in a zone write plug and one of these write operation fails. In such case, the disk zone write plug error recovery work is scheduled and executes a report zone. This in turn can result in a request allocation in the underlying driver to issue the report zones command to the device. But with the device queue freeze already started, this allocation will block, preventing the report zone execution and the continuation of the processing of the plugged BIOs. As plugged BIOs hold a queue usage reference, the queue freeze itself will never complete, resulting in a deadlock. Avoid this problem by completely removing from the zone write plugging code the use of report zones operations after a failed write operation, instead relying on the device user to either execute a report zones, reset the zone, finish the zone, or give up writing to the device (which is a fairly common pattern for file systems which degrade to read-only after write failures). This is not an unreasonnable requirement as all well-behaved applications, FSes and device mapper already use report zones to recover from write errors whenever possible by comparing the current position of a zone write pointer with what their assumption about the position is. The changes to remove the automatic error recovery are as follows - Completely remove the error recovery work and its associated resources (zone write plug list head, disk error list, and disk zone_wplugs_work work struct). This also removes the functions disk_zone_wplug_set_error() and disk_zone_wplug_clear_error(). - Change the BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_ERROR zone write plug flag into BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE. This new flag is set for a zone write plug whenever a write opration targetting the zone of the zone write plug fails. This flag indicates that the zone write pointer offset is not reliable and that it must be updated when the next report zone, reset zone, finish zone or disk revalidation is executed. - Modify blk_zone_write_plug_bio_endio() to set the BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE flag for the target zone of a failed write BIO. - Modify the function disk_zone_wplug_set_wp_offset() to clear this new flag, thus implementing recovery of a correct write pointer offset with the reset (all) zone and finish zone operations. - Modify blkdev_report_zones() to always use the disk_report_zones_cb() callback so that disk_zone_wplug_sync_wp_offset() can be called for any zone marked with the BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE flag. This implements recovery of a correct write pointer offset for zone write plugs marked with BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE and within the range of the report zones operation executed by the user. - Modify blk_revalidate_seq_zone() to call disk_zone_wplug_sync_wp_offset() for all sequential write required zones when a zoned block device is revalidated, thus always resolving any inconsistency between the write pointer offset of zone write plugs and the actual write pointer position of sequential zones.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'potential deadlocks', 'weakness': '', 'impact': '', 'vector': '', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'Linux kernel', 'version': '', 'component': 'zone write plug error recovery'}, reference_content=None, similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '639', 'name': 'Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(2767.506776150852)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '367', 'name': 'Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(2728.2550592152256)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '667', 'name': 'Improper Locking', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(2635.88308943435)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '1285', 'name': 'Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(2611.698735951615)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '119', 'name': 'Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(2605.466806151505)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '833', 'name': 'Deadlock', 'type': 'Base', 'original_content': 'The product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.', 'keyphrase_source': 'rootcause:potential deadlocks', 'source': 'dense', 'mapping_notes': {'usage': 'Allowed', 'rationale': 'This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.', 'comments': \"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.\nBroken Object Level Authorization / BOLA - BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.\nHorizontal Authorization - \"Horizontal Authorization\" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nRetrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.\n\n\nFor example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.\n\n\nOne manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-36539: An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-26679: vFairs 3.3 is affected by Insecure Permissions.

Several APIs on the web system display, without authorization, sensitive information such as health statements, previous bills in a specific restaurant, alcohol consumption and smoking habits. Each of the described API\u2019s, has in its URL one or more MongoDB ID which is not so simple to enumerate. However, they each receive a \u2018tiny URL\u2019 in Tabit\u2019s domain, in the form of https://tbit.be/{suffix} with suffix being a 5 characters long string containing numbers, lower- and upper-case letters. It is not so simple to enumerate them all, but really easy to find some that work and lead to a personal endpoint. This is both an example of OWASP: API4 - rate limiting and OWASP: API1 - Broken object level authorization. Furthermore, the redirect URL disclosed the MongoDB IDs discussed above, and we could use them to query other endpoints disclosing more personal information. For example: The URL https://tabitisrael.co.il/online-reservations/health-statement?orgId={org_id}&healthStatementId={health_statement_id} is used to invite friends to fill a health statement before attending the restaurant. We can use the health_statement_id to access the https://tgm-api.tabit.cloud/health-statement/{health_statement_id} API which disclose medical information as well as id number.\n\n- CVE-2022-36202: Doctor's Appointment System1.0 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control via edoc/patient/settings.php.

A sync token is used in Seafile file syncing protocol to authorize access to library data. To improve performance, the token is cached in memory in seaf-server. Upon receiving a token from sync client or SeaDrive client, the server checks whether the token exist in the cache. However, if the token exists in cache, the server doesn't check whether it's associated with the specific library in the URL. This vulnerability makes it possible to use any valid sync token to access data from any **known** library. Note that the attacker has to first find out the ID of a library which it has no access to. The library ID is a random UUID, which is not possible to be guessed. There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-1949: An access control bypass vulnerability found in 389-ds-base.

A local unprivileged user could use this flaw to bypass the checks that were introduced in response to CVE-2017-7500 and CVE-2017-7501, potentially gaining root privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-0280: A race condition vulnerability exists in the QuickClean feature of McAfee Total Protection for Windows prior to 16.0.43 that allows a local user to gain privilege elevation and perform an arbitrary file delete. This could lead to sensitive files being deleted and potentially cause denial of service. This attack exploits the way symlinks are created and how the product works with them.\n\n- CVE-2022-0915: There is a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition Vulnerability in Logitech Sync for Windows prior to 2.4.574. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may escalate the permission to the system user.\n\n- CVE-2022-21198: Time-of-check time-of-use race condition in the BIOS firmware for some Intel(R) Processors may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\n\n- CVE-2022-23651: b2-sdk-python is a python library to access cloud storage provided by backblaze. Linux and Mac releases of the SDK version 1.14.0 and below contain a key disclosure vulnerability that, in certain conditions, can be exploited by local attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. SDK users of the SqliteAccountInfo format are vulnerable while users of the InMemoryAccountInfo format are safe. The SqliteAccountInfo saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping) in a local database file ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info, ~/.b2_account_info or a user-defined path). When first created, the file is world readable and is (typically a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the user. If the directory containing the file is readable by a local attacker then during the brief period between file creation and permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file and maintain a handle to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents after the file after the sensitive information has been saved to it. Consumers of this SDK who rely on it to save data using SqliteAccountInfo class should upgrade to the latest version of the SDK. Those who believe a local user might have opened a handle using this race condition, should remove the affected database files and regenerate all application keys. Users should upgrade to b2-sdk-python 1.14.1 or later.\n\n- CVE-2022-23653: B2 Command Line Tool is the official command line tool for the backblaze cloud storage service. Linux and Mac releases of the B2 command-line tool version 3.2.0 and below contain a key disclosure vulnerability that, in certain conditions, can be exploited by local attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. The command line tool saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping) in a local database file (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info`, `~/.b2_account_info` or a user-defined path) when `b2 authorize-account` is first run. This happens regardless of whether a valid key is provided or not. When first created, the file is world readable and is (typically a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the user. If the directory is readable by a local attacker and the user did not yet run `b2 authorize-account` then during the brief period between file creation and permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file and maintain a handle to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents after the file after the sensitive information has been saved to it. Users that have not yet run `b2 authorize-account` should upgrade to B2 Command-Line Tool v3.2.1 before running it. Users that have run `b2 authorize-account` are safe if at the time of the file creation no other local users had read access to the local configuration file. Users that have run `b2 authorize-account` where the designated path could be opened by another local user should upgrade to B2 Command-Line Tool v3.2.1 and remove the database and regenerate all application keys. Note that `b2 clear-account` does not remove the database file and it should not be used to ensure that all open handles to the file are invalidated. If B2 Command-Line Tool cannot be upgraded to v3.2.1 due to a dependency conflict, a binary release can be used instead. Alternatively a new version could be installed within a virtualenv, or the permissions can be changed to prevent local users from opening the database file.\n\n- CVE-2022-25165: An issue was discovered in Amazon AWS VPN Client 2.0.0. A TOCTOU race condition exists during the validation of VPN configuration files. This allows parameters outside of the AWS VPN Client allow list to be injected into the configuration file prior to the AWS VPN Client service (running as SYSTEM) processing the file. Dangerous arguments can be injected by a low-level user such as log, which allows an arbitrary destination to be specified for writing log files. This leads to an arbitrary file write as SYSTEM with partial control over the files content. This can be abused to cause an elevation of privilege or denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2022-26859: Dell BIOS contains a race condition vulnerability. A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious input via SMI in order to bypass security checks during SMM.\n\n- CVE-2022-28743: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulerability in Foscam R2C IP camera running System FW <= 1.13.1.6, and Application FW <= 2.91.2.66, allows an authenticated remote attacker with administrator permissions to execute arbitrary remote code via a malicious firmware patch. The impact of this vulnerability is that the remote attacker could gain full remote access to the IP camera and the underlying Linux system with root permissions. With root access to the camera's Linux OS, an attacker could effectively change the code that is running, add backdoor access, or invade the privacy of the user by accessing the live camera stream.\n\n- CVE-2022-29800: A time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition vulnerability was found in networkd-dispatcher. This flaw exists because there is a certain time between the scripts being discovered and them being run. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to replace scripts that networkd-dispatcher believes to be owned by root with ones that are not.\n\n- CVE-2022-31466: Time of Check - Time of Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability in Quick Heal Total Security prior to 12.1.1.27 allows a local attacker to achieve privilege escalation, potentially leading to deletion of system files. This is achieved through exploiting the time between detecting a file as malicious and when the action of quarantining or cleaning is performed, and using the time to replace the malicious file by a symlink.\n\n- CVE-2022-33691: A possible race condition vulnerability in score driver prior to SMR Jul-2022 Release 1 can allow local attackers to interleave malicious operations.\n\n- CVE-2022-34830: An Arm product family through 2022-06-29 has a TOCTOU Race Condition that allows non-privileged user to make improper GPU processing operations to gain access to already freed memory.\n\n- CVE-2022-34899: This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Parallels Access 6.5.4 (39316) Agent. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target host system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the Parallels service. By creating a symbolic link, an attacker can abuse the service to execute a file. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-16134.\n\n- CVE-2022-3590: WordPress is affected by an unauthenticated blind SSRF in the pingback feature. Because of a TOCTOU race condition between the validation checks and the HTTP request, attackers can reach internal hosts that are explicitly forbidden.\n\n- CVE-2022-45842: Unauth. Race Condition vulnerability in WP ULike Plugin <= 4.6.4 on WordPress allows attackers to increase/decrease rating scores. \n\n- CVE-2022-1537: file.copy operations in GruntJS are vulnerable to a TOCTOU race condition leading to arbitrary file write in GitHub repository gruntjs/grunt prior to 1.5.3. This vulnerability is capable of arbitrary file writes which can lead to local privilege escalation to the GruntJS user if a lower-privileged user has write access to both source and destination directories as the lower-privileged user can create a symlink to the GruntJS user's .bashrc file or replace /etc/shadow file if the GruntJS user is root.\n\n- CVE-2022-21658: Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the `std::fs::remove_dir_all` standard library function is vulnerable a race condition enabling symlink following (CWE-363). An attacker could use this security issue to trick a privileged program into deleting files and directories the attacker couldn't otherwise access or delete. Rust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.58.0 is affected by this vulnerability with 1.58.1 containing a patch. Note that the following build targets don't have usable APIs to properly mitigate the attack, and are thus still vulnerable even with a patched toolchain: macOS before version 10.10 (Yosemite) and REDOX. We recommend everyone to update to Rust 1.58.1 as soon as possible, especially people developing programs expected to run in privileged contexts (including system daemons and setuid binaries), as those have the highest risk of being affected by this. Note that adding checks in your codebase before calling remove_dir_all will not mitigate the vulnerability, as they would also be vulnerable to race conditions like remove_dir_all itself. The existing mitigation is working as intended outside of race conditions.\n\n- CVE-2022-23563: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. In multiple places, TensorFlow uses `tempfile.mktemp` to create temporary files. While this is acceptable in testing, in utilities and libraries it is dangerous as a different process can create the file between the check for the filename in `mktemp` and the actual creation of the file by a subsequent operation (a TOC/TOU type of weakness). In several instances, TensorFlow was supposed to actually create a temporary directory instead of a file. This logic bug is hidden away by the `mktemp` function usage. We have patched the issue in several commits, replacing `mktemp` with the safer `mkstemp`/`mkdtemp` functions, according to the usage pattern. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-4098: Insufficient data validation in Mojo in Google Chrome prior to 96.0.4664.110 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to potentially perform a sandbox escape via a crafted HTML page.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-362 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-362 (ChildOf)",

All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2009-0935: Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice\n\n- CVE-2010-4210: function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.\n\n- CVE-2008-4302: Chain: OS kernel does not properly handle a failure of a function call (CWE-755), leading to an unlock of a resource that was not locked (CWE-832), with resultant crash.\n\n- CVE-2009-1243: OS kernel performs an unlock in some incorrect circumstances, leading to panic.\n\n- CVE-2009-2857: OS deadlock\n\n- CVE-2009-1961: OS deadlock involving 3 separate functions\n\n- CVE-2009-2699: deadlock in library\n\n- CVE-2009-4272: deadlock triggered by packets that force collisions in a routing table\n\n- CVE-2002-1850: read/write deadlock between web server and script\n\n- CVE-2004-0174: web server deadlock involving multiple listening connections\n\n- CVE-2009-1388: multiple simultaneous calls to the same function trigger deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2006-5158: chain: other weakness leads to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) or deadlock (CWE-833).\n\n- CVE-2006-4342: deadlock when an operation is performed on a resource while it is being removed.\n\n- CVE-2006-2374: Deadlock in device driver triggered by using file handle of a related device.\n\n- CVE-2006-2275: Deadlock when large number of small messages cannot be processed quickly enough.\n\n- CVE-2005-3847: OS kernel has deadlock triggered by a signal during a core dump.\n\n- CVE-2005-3106: Race condition leads to deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2005-2456: Chain: array index error (CWE-129) leads to deadlock (CWE-833)\n\n- CVE-2001-0682: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a mutex.\n\n- CVE-2002-1914: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.\n\n- CVE-2002-1915: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.\n\n- CVE-2002-0051: Critical file can be opened with exclusive read access by user, preventing application of security policy.

This issue is fixed in macOS Big Sur 11.2, Security Update 2021-001 Catalina, Security Update 2021-001 Mojave, watchOS 7.3, tvOS 14.4, iOS 14.4 and iPadOS 14.4. A malicious application may be able to elevate privileges. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited..\n\n- CVE-2021-31961: Windows InstallService Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26708: A local privilege escalation was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.10.13. Multiple race conditions in the AF_VSOCK implementation are caused by wrong locking in net/vmw_vsock/af_vsock.c. The race conditions were implicitly introduced in the commits that added VSOCK multi-transport support.\n\n- CVE-2021-0330: In add_user_ce and remove_user_ce of storaged.cpp, there is a possible use-after-free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in storaged with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-9 Android-10 Android-11Android ID: A-170732441\n\n- CVE-2021-0940: In TBD of TBD, there is a possible out of bounds write due to improper locking.

The fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris). The fix is very small and a git patch is available for those using unsupported versions of Puma.\n\n- CVE-2021-4001: A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's ebpf verifier between bpf_map_update_elem and bpf_map_freeze due to a missing lock in kernel/bpf/syscall.c. In this flaw, a local user with a special privilege (cap_sys_admin or cap_bpf) can modify the frozen mapped address space. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.16 rc2.\n\n- CVE-2021-41141: PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in the C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In various parts of PJSIP, when error/failure occurs, it is found that the function returns without releasing the currently held locks. This could result in a system deadlock, which cause a denial of service for the users. No release has yet been made which contains the linked fix commit. All versions up to an including 2.11.1 are affected. Users may need to manually apply the patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-4149: A vulnerability was found in btrfs_alloc_tree_b in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c in the Linux kernel due to an improper lock operation in btrfs. In this flaw, a user with a local privilege may cause a denial of service (DOS) due to a deadlock problem.\n\n- CVE-2022-20016: In vow driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking.

This could lead to local denial of service in kernel.\n\n- CVE-2022-42775: In camera driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local denial of service in kernel.\n\n- CVE-2022-26356: Racy interactions between dirty vram tracking and paging log dirty hypercalls Activation of log dirty mode done by XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram (was named HVMOP_track_dirty_vram before Xen 4.9) is racy with ongoing log dirty hypercalls. A suitably timed call to XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram can enable log dirty while another CPU is still in the process of tearing down the structures related to a previously enabled log dirty mode (XEN_DOMCTL_SHADOW_OP_OFF). This is due to lack of mutually exclusive locking between both operations and can lead to entries being added in already freed slots, resulting in a memory leak.\n\n- CVE-2021-0147: Improper locking in the Power Management Controller (PMC) for some Intel Chipset firmware before versions pmc_fw_lbg_c1-21ww02a and pmc_fw_lbg_b0-21ww02a may allow a privileged user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-39640: In __dwc3_gadget_ep0_queue of ep0.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to improper locking.

The `fixed_length` argument is also used to determine the size needed for the output tensor(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L63-L79). This is followed by reencoding code(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L85-L94). The erroneous code is the last line above: it is moving the `out_data` pointer by `fixed_length * sizeof(T)` bytes whereas it only copied at most `fixed_length` bytes from the input. This results in parts of the input not being decoded into the output. Furthermore, because the pointer advance is far wider than desired, this quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data. This OOB write leads to interpreter crash in the reproducer mentioned here, but more severe attacks can be mounted too, given that this gadget allows writing to periodically placed locations in memory. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29947: Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 87.

In a configuration which uses BIND's default settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credential configuration options. Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers. For servers that meet these conditions, the ISC SPNEGO implementation is vulnerable to various attacks, depending on the CPU architecture for which BIND was built: For named binaries compiled for 64-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a buffer over-read, leading to a server crash. For named binaries compiled for 32-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a server crash due to a buffer overflow and possibly also to achieve remote code execution. We have determined that standard SPNEGO implementations are available in the MIT and Heimdal Kerberos libraries, which support a broad range of operating systems, rendering the ISC implementation unnecessary and obsolete. Therefore, to reduce the attack surface for BIND users, we will be removing the ISC SPNEGO implementation in the April releases of BIND 9.11 and 9.16 (it had already been dropped from BIND 9.17).

Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.\n\n\nA race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:\n\n\n  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.\n\n  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.\n\nA race condition exists when an \"interfering code sequence\" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.\n\nThe interfering code sequence could be \"trusted\" or \"untrusted.\" A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-29527: Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2021-0920: Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-6819: Chain: race condition (CWE-362) leads to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2019-18827: chain: JTAG interface is not disabled (CWE-1191) during ROM code execution, introducing a race condition (CWE-362) to extract encryption keys\n\n- CVE-2019-1161: Chain: race condition (CWE-362) in anti-malware product allows deletion of files by creating a junction (CWE-1386) and using hard links during the time window in which a temporary file is created and deleted.\n\n- CVE-2015-1743: TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed\n\n- CVE-2014-8273: Chain: chipset has a race condition (CWE-362) between when an interrupt handler detects an attempt to write-enable the BIOS (in violation of the lock bit), and when the handler resets the write-enable bit back to 0, allowing attackers to issue BIOS writes during the timing window [REF-1237].\n\n- CVE-2008-5044: Race condition leading to a crash by calling a hook removal procedure while other activities are occurring at the same time.\n\n- CVE-2008-2958: chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.\n\n- CVE-2008-1570: chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.\n\n- CVE-2008-0058: Unsynchronized caching operation enables a race condition that causes messages to be sent to a deallocated object.\n\n- CVE-2008-0379: Race condition during initialization triggers a buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2007-6599: Daemon crash by quickly performing operations and undoing them, which eventually leads to an operation that does not acquire a lock.\n\n- CVE-2007-6180: chain: race condition triggers NULL pointer dereference\n\n- CVE-2007-5794: Race condition in library function could cause data to be sent to the wrong process.\n\n- CVE-2007-3970: Race condition in file parser leads to heap corruption.\n\n- CVE-2008-5021: chain: race condition allows attacker to access an object while it is still being initialized, causing software to access uninitialized memory.\n\n- CVE-2009-4895: chain: race condition for an argument value, possibly resulting in NULL dereference\n\n- CVE-2009-3547: chain: race condition might allow resource to be released before operating on it, leading to NULL dereference\n\n- CVE-2006-5051: Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-6388: Out of bounds access in WebAudio in Google Chrome prior to 80.0.3987.87 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-0366: In vpu, there is a possible memory corruption due to a race condition.

The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, get de-allocated when a guest switched (back) from v2 to v1. The freeing of such pages requires that the hypervisor know where in the guest these pages were mapped. The hypervisor tracks only one use within guest space, but racing requests from the guest to insert mappings of these pages may result in any of them to become mapped in multiple locations. Upon switching back from v2 to v1, the guest would then retain access to a page that was freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes.\n\n- CVE-2021-28701: Another race in XENMAPSPACE_grant_table handling Guests are permitted access to certain Xen-owned pages of memory. The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, are de-allocated when a guest switches (back) from v2 to v1. Freeing such pages requires that the hypervisor enforce that no parallel request can result in the addition of a mapping of such a page to a guest. That enforcement was missing, allowing guests to retain access to pages that were freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes. Unfortunately, when XSA-379 was being prepared, this similar issue was not noticed.\n\n- CVE-2020-11492: An issue was discovered in Docker Desktop through 2.2.0.5 on Windows.

CVE-2022-23042\n\n- CVE-2022-23041: Linux PV device frontends vulnerable to attacks by backends T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Several Linux PV device frontends are using the grant table interfaces for removing access rights of the backends in ways being subject to race conditions, resulting in potential data leaks, data corruption by malicious backends, and denial of service triggered by malicious backends: blkfront, netfront, scsifront and the gntalloc driver are testing whether a grant reference is still in use. If this is not the case, they assume that a following removal of the granted access will always succeed, which is not true in case the backend has mapped the granted page between those two operations. As a result the backend can keep access to the memory page of the guest no matter how the page will be used after the frontend I/O has finished.

When a BGP flow route with redirect IP extended community is received, and the reachability to the next-hop of the corresponding redirect IP is flapping, the rpd process might crash. Whether the crash occurs depends on the timing of the internally processing of these two events and is outside the attackers control. Please note that this issue also affects Route-Reflectors unless 'routing-options flow firewall-install-disable' is configured. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS: 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S10, 18.4R3-S10; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S7; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S8, 19.2R3-S4; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S8; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S3; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S2; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2.

During viewing of a malicious request, it can be manipulated into issuing a request that does not respect its upstream proxy configuration. This could leak NetNTLM hashes on Windows systems that fail to block outbound SMB.\n\n- CVE-2021-30127: TerraMaster F2-210 devices through 2021-04-03 use UPnP to make the admin web server accessible over the Internet on TCP port 8181, which is arguably inconsistent with the \"It is only available on the local network\" documentation. NOTE: manually editing /etc/upnp.json provides a partial but undocumented workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31810: An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.6.7, 2.7.x through 2.7.3, and 3.x through 3.0.1. A malicious FTP server can use the PASV response to trick Net::FTP into connecting back to a given IP address and port. This potentially makes curl extract information about services that are otherwise private and not disclosed (e.g., the attacker can conduct port scans and service banner extractions).\n\n- CVE-2021-20999: In Weidm\u00fcller u-controls and IoT-Gateways in versions up to 1.12.1 a network port intended only for device-internal usage is accidentally accessible via external network interfaces. By exploiting this vulnerability the device may be manipulated or the operation may be stopped.\n\n- CVE-2021-21210: Inappropriate implementation in Network in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.72 allowed a remote attacker to potentially access local UDP ports via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-42343: An issue was discovered in the Dask distributed package before 2021.10.0 for Python. Single machine Dask clusters started with dask.distributed.LocalCluster or dask.distributed.Client (which defaults to using LocalCluster) would mistakenly configure their respective Dask workers to listen on external interfaces (typically with a randomly selected high port) rather than only on localhost. A Dask cluster created using this method (when running on a machine that has an applicable port exposed) could be used by a sophisticated attacker to achieve remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2021-22916: In Brave Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.26.60, when adblocking is enabled and a proxy browser extension is installed, the CNAME adblocking feature issues DNS requests that used the system DNS settings instead of the extension's proxy settings, resulting in possible information disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2021-22917: Brave Browser Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.20 is vulnerable to information disclosure by way of DNS requests in Tor windows not flowing through Tor if adblocking was enabled.\n\n- CVE-2020-4062: In Conjur OSS Helm Chart before 2.0.0, a recently identified critical vulnerability resulted in the installation of the Conjur Postgres database with an open port. This allows an attacker to gain full read & write access to the Conjur Postgres database, including escalating the attacker's privileges to assume full control. A malicious actor who knows the IP address and port number of the Postgres database and has access into the Kubernetes cluster where Conjur runs can gain full read & write access to the Postgres database. This enables the attacker to write a policy that allows full access to retrieve any secret. This Helm chart is a method to install Conjur OSS into a Kubernetes environment. Hence, the systems impacted are only Conjur OSS systems that were deployed using this chart. Other deployments including Docker and the CyberArk Dynamic Access Provider (DAP) are not affected. To remediate this vulnerability, clone the latest Helm Chart and follow the upgrade instructions. If you are not able to fully remediate this vulnerability immediately, you can mitigate some of the risk by making sure Conjur OSS is deployed on an isolated Kubernetes cluster or namespace. The term \"isolated\" refers to: - No other workloads besides Conjur OSS and its backend database are running in that Kubernetes cluster/namespace. - Kubernetes and helm access to the cluster/namespace is limited to security administrators via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).\n\n- CVE-2020-10087: GitLab before 12.8.2 allows Information Disclosure. Badge images were not being proxied, causing mixed content warnings as well as leaking the IP address of the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-32690: Helm is a tool for managing Charts (packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources). In versions of helm prior to 3.6.1, a vulnerability exists where the username and password credentials associated with a Helm repository could be passed on to another domain referenced by that Helm repository. This issue has been resolved in 3.6.1. There is a workaround through which one may check for improperly passed credentials. One may use a username and password for a Helm repository and may audit the Helm repository in order to check for another domain being used that could have received the credentials. In the `index.yaml` file for that repository, one may look for another domain in the `urls` list for the chart versions. If there is another domain found and that chart version was pulled or installed, the credentials would be passed on.\n\n- CVE-2021-32707: Nextcloud Mail is a mail app for Nextcloud. In versions prior to 1.9.6, the Nextcloud Mail application does not, by default, render images in emails to not leak the read state. The privacy filter failed to filter images with a `background-image` CSS attribute. Note that the images were still passed through the Nextcloud image proxy, and thus there was no IP leakage. The issue was patched in version 1.9.6 and 1.10.0. No workarounds are known to exist.\n\n- CVE-2020-14312: A flaw was found in the default configuration of dnsmasq, as shipped with Fedora versions prior to 31 and in all versions Red Hat Enterprise Linux, where it listens on any interface and accepts queries from addresses outside of its local subnet. In particular, the option `local-service` is not enabled. Running dnsmasq in this manner may inadvertently make it an open resolver accessible from any address on the internet. This flaw allows an attacker to conduct a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against other systems.\n\n- CVE-2021-20149: Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 does not have sufficient access controls for the WAN interface. The default iptables ruleset for governing access to services on the device only apply to IPv4. All services running on the devices are accessible via the WAN interface via IPv6 by default.\n\n- CVE-2020-1938: When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations.\n\n- CVE-2022-22547: Simple Diagnostics Agent - versions 1.0 (up to version 1.57.), allows an attacker to access information which would otherwise be restricted via a random port 9000-65535. This allows information gathering which could be used exploit future open-source security exploits.\n\n- CVE-2022-44784: An issue was discovered in Appalti & Contratti 9.12.2. The target web applications LFS and DL229 expose a set of services provided by the Axis 1.4 instance, embedded directly into the applications, as hinted by the WEB-INF/web.xml file leaked through Local File Inclusion. Among the exposed services, there is the Axis AdminService, which, through the default configuration, should normally be accessible only by the localhost. Nevertheless, by trying to access the mentioned service, both in LFS and DL229, the service can actually be reached even by remote users, allowing creation of arbitrary services on the server side. When an attacker can reach the AdminService, they can use it to instantiate arbitrary services on the server. The exploit procedure is well known and described in Generic AXIS-SSRF exploitation. Basically, the attack consists of writing a JSP page inside the root directory of the web application, through the org.apache.axis.handlers.LogHandler class.\n\n- CVE-2022-26834: Improper access control vulnerability in Rakuten Casa version AP_F_V1_4_1 or AP_F_V2_0_0 allows a remote attacker to obtain the information stored in the product because the product is set to accept HTTP connections from the WAN side by default.\n\n- CVE-2022-4390: A network misconfiguration is present in versions prior to 1.0.9.90 of the NETGEAR RAX30 AX2400 series of routers. IPv6 is enabled for the WAN interface by default on these devices. While there are firewall restrictions in place that define access restrictions for IPv4 traffic, these restrictions do not appear to be applied to the WAN interface for IPv6. This allows arbitrary access to any services running on the device that may be inadvertently listening via IPv6, such as the SSH and Telnet servers spawned on ports 22 and 23 by default. This misconfiguration could allow an attacker to interact with services only intended to be accessible by clients on the local network.\n\n- CVE-2022-45414: If a Thunderbird user quoted from an HTML email, for example by replying to the email, and the email contained either a VIDEO tag with the POSTER attribute or an OBJECT tag with a DATA attribute, a network request to the referenced remote URL was performed, regardless of a configuration to block remote content. An image loaded from the POSTER attribute was shown in the composer window. These issues could have given an attacker additional capabilities when targetting releases that did not yet have a fix for CVE-2022-3033 which was reported around three months ago. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.5.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-47717: Last Yard 22.09.8-1 is vulnerable to Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).\n\n- CVE-2022-3057: Inappropriate implementation in iframe Sandbox in Google Chrome prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-31055: kCTF is a Kubernetes-based infrastructure for capture the flag (CTF) competitions. Prior to version 1.6.0, the kctf cluster set-src-ip-ranges was broken and allowed traffic from any IP. The problem has been patched in v1.6.0. As a workaround, those who want to test challenges privately can mark them as `public: false` and use `kctf chal debug port-forward` to connect.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",

This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nRetrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.\n\n\nFor example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.\n\n\nOne manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-36539: An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-26679: vFairs 3.3 is affected by Insecure Permissions. Any user logged in to a vFairs virtual conference or event can modify any other users profile information or profile picture. After receiving any user's unique identification number and their own, an HTTP POST request can be made update their profile description or supply a new profile image. This can lead to potential cross-site scripting attacks on any user, or upload malicious PHP webshells as \"profile pictures.\" The user IDs can be easily determined by other responses from the API for an event or chat room.\n\n- CVE-2021-41847: An issue was discovered in 3xLogic Infinias Access Control through 6.7.10708.0, affecting physical security. Users with login credentials assigned to a specific zone can send modified HTTP GET and POST requests, allowing them to view user data such as personal information and Prox card credentials. Also, an authorized user of one zone can send API requests to unlock electronic locks associated with zones they are unauthorized to have access to. They can also create new user logins for zones they were not authorized to access, including the root zone of the software.\n\n- CVE-2021-22906: Nextcloud End-to-End Encryption before 1.5.3, 1.6.3 and 1.7.1 suffers from a denial of service vulnerability due to permitting any authenticated users to lock files of other users.\n\n- CVE-2021-21012: Magento versions 2.4.1 (and earlier), 2.4.0-p1 (and earlier) and 2.3.6 (and earlier) are vulnerable to an insecure direct object vulnerability (IDOR) in the checkout module.

Several APIs on the web system display, without authorization, sensitive information such as health statements, previous bills in a specific restaurant, alcohol consumption and smoking habits. Each of the described API\u2019s, has in its URL one or more MongoDB ID which is not so simple to enumerate. However, they each receive a \u2018tiny URL\u2019 in Tabit\u2019s domain, in the form of https://tbit.be/{suffix} with suffix being a 5 characters long string containing numbers, lower- and upper-case letters. It is not so simple to enumerate them all, but really easy to find some that work and lead to a personal endpoint. This is both an example of OWASP: API4 - rate limiting and OWASP: API1 - Broken object level authorization. Furthermore, the redirect URL disclosed the MongoDB IDs discussed above, and we could use them to query other endpoints disclosing more personal information. For example: The URL https://tabitisrael.co.il/online-reservations/health-statement?orgId={org_id}&healthStatementId={health_statement_id} is used to invite friends to fill a health statement before attending the restaurant.

A sync token is used in Seafile file syncing protocol to authorize access to library data. To improve performance, the token is cached in memory in seaf-server. Upon receiving a token from sync client or SeaDrive client, the server checks whether the token exist in the cache. However, if the token exists in cache, the server doesn't check whether it's associated with the specific library in the URL. This vulnerability makes it possible to use any valid sync token to access data from any **known** library. Note that the attacker has to first find out the ID of a library which it has no access to. The library ID is a random UUID, which is not possible to be guessed. There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-1949: An access control bypass vulnerability found in 389-ds-base.

A local unprivileged user could use this flaw to bypass the checks that were introduced in response to CVE-2017-7500 and CVE-2017-7501, potentially gaining root privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-0280: A race condition vulnerability exists in the QuickClean feature of McAfee Total Protection for Windows prior to 16.0.43 that allows a local user to gain privilege elevation and perform an arbitrary file delete. This could lead to sensitive files being deleted and potentially cause denial of service. This attack exploits the way symlinks are created and how the product works with them.\n\n- CVE-2022-0915: There is a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition Vulnerability in Logitech Sync for Windows prior to 2.4.574. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may escalate the permission to the system user.\n\n- CVE-2022-21198: Time-of-check time-of-use race condition in the BIOS firmware for some Intel(R) Processors may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\n\n- CVE-2022-23651: b2-sdk-python is a python library to access cloud storage provided by backblaze. Linux and Mac releases of the SDK version 1.14.0 and below contain a key disclosure vulnerability that, in certain conditions, can be exploited by local attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. SDK users of the SqliteAccountInfo format are vulnerable while users of the InMemoryAccountInfo format are safe. The SqliteAccountInfo saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping) in a local database file ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info, ~/.b2_account_info or a user-defined path). When first created, the file is world readable and is (typically a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the user. If the directory containing the file is readable by a local attacker then during the brief period between file creation and permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file and maintain a handle to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents after the file after the sensitive information has been saved to it. Consumers of this SDK who rely on it to save data using SqliteAccountInfo class should upgrade to the latest version of the SDK. Those who believe a local user might have opened a handle using this race condition, should remove the affected database files and regenerate all application keys. Users should upgrade to b2-sdk-python 1.14.1 or later.\n\n- CVE-2022-23653: B2 Command Line Tool is the official command line tool for the backblaze cloud storage service. Linux and Mac releases of the B2 command-line tool version 3.2.0 and below contain a key disclosure vulnerability that, in certain conditions, can be exploited by local attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. The command line tool saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping) in a local database file (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info`, `~/.b2_account_info` or a user-defined path) when `b2 authorize-account` is first run. This happens regardless of whether a valid key is provided or not. When first created, the file is world readable and is (typically a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the user. If the directory is readable by a local attacker and the user did not yet run `b2 authorize-account` then during the brief period between file creation and permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file and maintain a handle to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents after the file after the sensitive information has been saved to it. Users that have not yet run `b2 authorize-account` should upgrade to B2 Command-Line Tool v3.2.1 before running it. Users that have run `b2 authorize-account` are safe if at the time of the file creation no other local users had read access to the local configuration file. Users that have run `b2 authorize-account` where the designated path could be opened by another local user should upgrade to B2 Command-Line Tool v3.2.1 and remove the database and regenerate all application keys. Note that `b2 clear-account` does not remove the database file and it should not be used to ensure that all open handles to the file are invalidated. If B2 Command-Line Tool cannot be upgraded to v3.2.1 due to a dependency conflict, a binary release can be used instead. Alternatively a new version could be installed within a virtualenv, or the permissions can be changed to prevent local users from opening the database file.\n\n- CVE-2022-25165: An issue was discovered in Amazon AWS VPN Client 2.0.0. A TOCTOU race condition exists during the validation of VPN configuration files. This allows parameters outside of the AWS VPN Client allow list to be injected into the configuration file prior to the AWS VPN Client service (running as SYSTEM) processing the file. Dangerous arguments can be injected by a low-level user such as log, which allows an arbitrary destination to be specified for writing log files. This leads to an arbitrary file write as SYSTEM with partial control over the files content. This can be abused to cause an elevation of privilege or denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2022-26859: Dell BIOS contains a race condition vulnerability. A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious input via SMI in order to bypass security checks during SMM.\n\n- CVE-2022-28743: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulerability in Foscam R2C IP camera running System FW <= 1.13.1.6, and Application FW <= 2.91.2.66, allows an authenticated remote attacker with administrator permissions to execute arbitrary remote code via a malicious firmware patch. The impact of this vulnerability is that the remote attacker could gain full remote access to the IP camera and the underlying Linux system with root permissions. With root access to the camera's Linux OS, an attacker could effectively change the code that is running, add backdoor access, or invade the privacy of the user by accessing the live camera stream.\n\n- CVE-2022-29800: A time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition vulnerability was found in networkd-dispatcher. This flaw exists because there is a certain time between the scripts being discovered and them being run. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to replace scripts that networkd-dispatcher believes to be owned by root with ones that are not.\n\n- CVE-2022-31466: Time of Check - Time of Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability in Quick Heal Total Security prior to 12.1.1.27 allows a local attacker to achieve privilege escalation, potentially leading to deletion of system files. This is achieved through exploiting the time between detecting a file as malicious and when the action of quarantining or cleaning is performed, and using the time to replace the malicious file by a symlink.\n\n- CVE-2022-33691: A possible race condition vulnerability in score driver prior to SMR Jul-2022 Release 1 can allow local attackers to interleave malicious operations.\n\n- CVE-2022-34830: An Arm product family through 2022-06-29 has a TOCTOU Race Condition that allows non-privileged user to make improper GPU processing operations to gain access to already freed memory.\n\n- CVE-2022-34899: This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Parallels Access 6.5.4 (39316) Agent. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target host system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the Parallels service. By creating a symbolic link, an attacker can abuse the service to execute a file. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-16134.\n\n- CVE-2022-3590: WordPress is affected by an unauthenticated blind SSRF in the pingback feature. Because of a TOCTOU race condition between the validation checks and the HTTP request, attackers can reach internal hosts that are explicitly forbidden.\n\n- CVE-2022-45842: Unauth. Race Condition vulnerability in WP ULike Plugin <= 4.6.4 on WordPress allows attackers to increase/decrease rating scores. \n\n- CVE-2022-1537: file.copy operations in GruntJS are vulnerable to a TOCTOU race condition leading to arbitrary file write in GitHub repository gruntjs/grunt prior to 1.5.3. This vulnerability is capable of arbitrary file writes which can lead to local privilege escalation to the GruntJS user if a lower-privileged user has write access to both source and destination directories as the lower-privileged user can create a symlink to the GruntJS user's .bashrc file or replace /etc/shadow file if the GruntJS user is root.\n\n- CVE-2022-21658: Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the `std::fs::remove_dir_all` standard library function is vulnerable a race condition enabling symlink following (CWE-363). An attacker could use this security issue to trick a privileged program into deleting files and directories the attacker couldn't otherwise access or delete. Rust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.58.0 is affected by this vulnerability with 1.58.1 containing a patch. Note that the following build targets don't have usable APIs to properly mitigate the attack, and are thus still vulnerable even with a patched toolchain: macOS before version 10.10 (Yosemite) and REDOX. We recommend everyone to update to Rust 1.58.1 as soon as possible, especially people developing programs expected to run in privileged contexts (including system daemons and setuid binaries), as those have the highest risk of being affected by this. Note that adding checks in your codebase before calling remove_dir_all will not mitigate the vulnerability, as they would also be vulnerable to race conditions like remove_dir_all itself. The existing mitigation is working as intended outside of race conditions.\n\n- CVE-2022-23563: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. In multiple places, TensorFlow uses `tempfile.mktemp` to create temporary files. While this is acceptable in testing, in utilities and libraries it is dangerous as a different process can create the file between the check for the filename in `mktemp` and the actual creation of the file by a subsequent operation (a TOC/TOU type of weakness). In several instances, TensorFlow was supposed to actually create a temporary directory instead of a file. This logic bug is hidden away by the `mktemp` function usage. We have patched the issue in several commits, replacing `mktemp` with the safer `mkstemp`/`mkdtemp` functions, according to the usage pattern. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-4098: Insufficient data validation in Mojo in Google Chrome prior to 96.0.4664.110 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to potentially perform a sandbox escape via a crafted HTML page.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-362 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-362 (ChildOf)",

All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2009-0935: Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice\n\n- CVE-2010-4210: function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.\n\n- CVE-2008-4302: Chain: OS kernel does not properly handle a failure of a function call (CWE-755), leading to an unlock of a resource that was not locked (CWE-832), with resultant crash.\n\n- CVE-2009-1243: OS kernel performs an unlock in some incorrect circumstances, leading to panic.\n\n- CVE-2009-2857: OS deadlock\n\n- CVE-2009-1961: OS deadlock involving 3 separate functions\n\n- CVE-2009-2699: deadlock in library\n\n- CVE-2009-4272: deadlock triggered by packets that force collisions in a routing table\n\n- CVE-2002-1850: read/write deadlock between web server and script\n\n- CVE-2004-0174: web server deadlock involving multiple listening connections\n\n- CVE-2009-1388: multiple simultaneous calls to the same function trigger deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2006-5158: chain: other weakness leads to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) or deadlock (CWE-833).\n\n- CVE-2006-4342: deadlock when an operation is performed on a resource while it is being removed.\n\n- CVE-2006-2374: Deadlock in device driver triggered by using file handle of a related device.\n\n- CVE-2006-2275: Deadlock when large number of small messages cannot be processed quickly enough.\n\n- CVE-2005-3847: OS kernel has deadlock triggered by a signal during a core dump.\n\n- CVE-2005-3106: Race condition leads to deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2005-2456: Chain: array index error (CWE-129) leads to deadlock (CWE-833)\n\n- CVE-2001-0682: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a mutex.\n\n- CVE-2002-1914: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.\n\n- CVE-2002-1915: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.\n\n- CVE-2002-0051: Critical file can be opened with exclusive read access by user, preventing application of security policy.

However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris). The fix is very small and a git patch is available for those using unsupported versions of Puma.\n\n- CVE-2021-4001: A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's ebpf verifier between bpf_map_update_elem and bpf_map_freeze due to a missing lock in kernel/bpf/syscall.c.

The implementation of `tf.io.decode_raw` produces incorrect results and crashes the Python interpreter when combining `fixed_length` and wider datatypes. The implementation of the padded version(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc) is buggy due to a confusion about pointer arithmetic rules. First, the code computes(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L61) the width of each output element by dividing the `fixed_length` value to the size of the type argument. The `fixed_length` argument is also used to determine the size needed for the output tensor(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L63-L79). This is followed by reencoding code(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L85-L94). The erroneous code is the last line above: it is moving the `out_data` pointer by `fixed_length * sizeof(T)` bytes whereas it only copied at most `fixed_length` bytes from the input. This results in parts of the input not being decoded into the output. Furthermore, because the pointer advance is far wider than desired, this quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data. This OOB write leads to interpreter crash in the reproducer mentioned here, but more severe attacks can be mounted too, given that this gadget allows writing to periodically placed locations in memory. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29947: Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 87.

In a configuration which uses BIND's default settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credential configuration options. Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers. For servers that meet these conditions, the ISC SPNEGO implementation is vulnerable to various attacks, depending on the CPU architecture for which BIND was built: For named binaries compiled for 64-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a buffer over-read, leading to a server crash. For named binaries compiled for 32-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a server crash due to a buffer overflow and possibly also to achieve remote code execution. We have determined that standard SPNEGO implementations are available in the MIT and Heimdal Kerberos libraries, which support a broad range of operating systems, rendering the ISC implementation unnecessary and obsolete. Therefore, to reduce the attack surface for BIND users, we will be removing the ISC SPNEGO implementation in the April releases of BIND 9.11 and 9.16 (it had already been dropped from BIND 9.17). We would not normally remove something from a stable ESV (Extended Support Version) of BIND, but since system libraries can replace the ISC SPNEGO implementation, we have made an exception in this case for reasons of stability and security.\n\n- CVE-2021-33590: GattLib 0.3-rc1 has a stack-based buffer over-read in get_device_path_from_mac in dbus/gattlib.c.\n\n- CVE-2021-1648: Microsoft splwow64 Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2020-11159: Buffer over-read can happen while processing WPA,RSN IE of beacon and response frames if IE length is less than length of frame pointer being accessed in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer Electronics Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon IoT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wired Infrastructure and Networking\n\n- CVE-2020-11285: Buffer over-read while unpacking the RTCP packet we may read extra byte if wrong length is provided in RTCP packets in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon IoT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2020-18771: Exiv2 0.27.99.0 has a global buffer over-read in Exiv2::Internal::Nikon1MakerNote::print0x0088 in nikonmn_int.cpp which can result in an information leak.\n\n- CVE-2020-19750: An issue was discovered in gpac 0.8.0.

Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.\n\n\nA race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:\n\n\n  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.\n\n  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.\n\nA race condition exists when an \"interfering code sequence\" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.\n\nThe interfering code sequence could be \"trusted\" or \"untrusted.\" A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-29527: Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2021-0920: Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-6819: Chain: race condition (CWE-362) leads to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2019-18827: chain: JTAG interface is not disabled (CWE-1191) during ROM code execution, introducing a race condition (CWE-362) to extract encryption keys\n\n- CVE-2019-1161: Chain: race condition (CWE-362) in anti-malware product allows deletion of files by creating a junction (CWE-1386) and using hard links during the time window in which a temporary file is created and deleted.\n\n- CVE-2015-1743: TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed\n\n- CVE-2014-8273: Chain: chipset has a race condition (CWE-362) between when an interrupt handler detects an attempt to write-enable the BIOS (in violation of the lock bit), and when the handler resets the write-enable bit back to 0, allowing attackers to issue BIOS writes during the timing window [REF-1237].\n\n- CVE-2008-5044: Race condition leading to a crash by calling a hook removal procedure while other activities are occurring at the same time.\n\n- CVE-2008-2958: chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.\n\n- CVE-2008-1570: chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.\n\n- CVE-2008-0058: Unsynchronized caching operation enables a race condition that causes messages to be sent to a deallocated object.\n\n- CVE-2008-0379: Race condition during initialization triggers a buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2007-6599: Daemon crash by quickly performing operations and undoing them, which eventually leads to an operation that does not acquire a lock.\n\n- CVE-2007-6180: chain: race condition triggers NULL pointer dereference\n\n- CVE-2007-5794: Race condition in library function could cause data to be sent to the wrong process.\n\n- CVE-2007-3970: Race condition in file parser leads to heap corruption.\n\n- CVE-2008-5021: chain: race condition allows attacker to access an object while it is still being initialized, causing software to access uninitialized memory.\n\n- CVE-2009-4895: chain: race condition for an argument value, possibly resulting in NULL dereference\n\n- CVE-2009-3547: chain: race condition might allow resource to be released before operating on it, leading to NULL dereference\n\n- CVE-2006-5051: Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-6388: Out of bounds access in WebAudio in Google Chrome prior to 80.0.3987.87 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-0366: In vpu, there is a possible memory corruption due to a race condition.

The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, get de-allocated when a guest switched (back) from v2 to v1. The freeing of such pages requires that the hypervisor know where in the guest these pages were mapped. The hypervisor tracks only one use within guest space, but racing requests from the guest to insert mappings of these pages may result in any of them to become mapped in multiple locations. Upon switching back from v2 to v1, the guest would then retain access to a page that was freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes.\n\n- CVE-2021-28701: Another race in XENMAPSPACE_grant_table handling Guests are permitted access to certain Xen-owned pages of memory. The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, are de-allocated when a guest switches (back) from v2 to v1. Freeing such pages requires that the hypervisor enforce that no parallel request can result in the addition of a mapping of such a page to a guest. That enforcement was missing, allowing guests to retain access to pages that were freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes. Unfortunately, when XSA-379 was being prepared, this similar issue was not noticed.\n\n- CVE-2020-11492: An issue was discovered in Docker Desktop through 2.2.0.5 on Windows.

As this crash depends on whether a route is a contributing route, and on the internal timing of the events triggered by the flap this vulnerability is outside the direct control of a potential attacker. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3-S6; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S4; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S4; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R2; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R2. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved All versions prior to 20.4R3-S4-EVO; 21.1-EVO version 21.1R1-EVO and later versions; 21.2-EVO versions prior to 21.2R2-EVO; 21.3-EVO versions prior to 21.3R2-EVO. This issue does not affect: Juniper Networks Junos OS versions 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R2, 19.3R1 and above prior to 20.2R1. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 20.2R1-EVO.\n\n- CVE-2022-32844: A race condition was addressed with improved state handling. This issue is fixed in tvOS 15.6, watchOS 8.7, iOS 15.6 and iPadOS 15.6. An app with arbitrary kernel read and write capability may be able to bypass Pointer Authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-24000: A race condition with requestPointerLock() and setTimeout() could have resulted in a user interacting with one tab when they believed they were on a separate tab. In conjunction with certain elements (such as &lt;input type=\"file\"&gt;) this could have led to an attack where a user was confused about the origin of the webpage and potentially disclosed information they did not intend to. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 88.\n\n- CVE-2022-2160: Insufficient policy enforcement in DevTools in Google Chrome on Windows prior to 103.0.5060.53 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to obtain potentially sensitive information from a user's local files via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-21881: Windows Kernel Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2022-21896: Windows DWM Core Library Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2022-24986: KDE KCron through 21.12.2 uses a temporary file in /tmp when saving, but reuses the filename during an editing session.

During viewing of a malicious request, it can be manipulated into issuing a request that does not respect its upstream proxy configuration. This could leak NetNTLM hashes on Windows systems that fail to block outbound SMB.\n\n- CVE-2021-30127: TerraMaster F2-210 devices through 2021-04-03 use UPnP to make the admin web server accessible over the Internet on TCP port 8181, which is arguably inconsistent with the \"It is only available on the local network\" documentation. NOTE: manually editing /etc/upnp.json provides a partial but undocumented workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31810: An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.6.7, 2.7.x through 2.7.3, and 3.x through 3.0.1. A malicious FTP server can use the PASV response to trick Net::FTP into connecting back to a given IP address and port. This potentially makes curl extract information about services that are otherwise private and not disclosed (e.g., the attacker can conduct port scans and service banner extractions).\n\n- CVE-2021-20999: In Weidm\u00fcller u-controls and IoT-Gateways in versions up to 1.12.1 a network port intended only for device-internal usage is accidentally accessible via external network interfaces. By exploiting this vulnerability the device may be manipulated or the operation may be stopped.\n\n- CVE-2021-21210: Inappropriate implementation in Network in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.72 allowed a remote attacker to potentially access local UDP ports via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-42343: An issue was discovered in the Dask distributed package before 2021.10.0 for Python. Single machine Dask clusters started with dask.distributed.LocalCluster or dask.distributed.Client (which defaults to using LocalCluster) would mistakenly configure their respective Dask workers to listen on external interfaces (typically with a randomly selected high port) rather than only on localhost. A Dask cluster created using this method (when running on a machine that has an applicable port exposed) could be used by a sophisticated attacker to achieve remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2021-22916: In Brave Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.26.60, when adblocking is enabled and a proxy browser extension is installed, the CNAME adblocking feature issues DNS requests that used the system DNS settings instead of the extension's proxy settings, resulting in possible information disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2021-22917: Brave Browser Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.20 is vulnerable to information disclosure by way of DNS requests in Tor windows not flowing through Tor if adblocking was enabled.\n\n- CVE-2020-4062: In Conjur OSS Helm Chart before 2.0.0, a recently identified critical vulnerability resulted in the installation of the Conjur Postgres database with an open port. This allows an attacker to gain full read & write access to the Conjur Postgres database, including escalating the attacker's privileges to assume full control. A malicious actor who knows the IP address and port number of the Postgres database and has access into the Kubernetes cluster where Conjur runs can gain full read & write access to the Postgres database. This enables the attacker to write a policy that allows full access to retrieve any secret. This Helm chart is a method to install Conjur OSS into a Kubernetes environment. Hence, the systems impacted are only Conjur OSS systems that were deployed using this chart. Other deployments including Docker and the CyberArk Dynamic Access Provider (DAP) are not affected. To remediate this vulnerability, clone the latest Helm Chart and follow the upgrade instructions. If you are not able to fully remediate this vulnerability immediately, you can mitigate some of the risk by making sure Conjur OSS is deployed on an isolated Kubernetes cluster or namespace. The term \"isolated\" refers to: - No other workloads besides Conjur OSS and its backend database are running in that Kubernetes cluster/namespace. - Kubernetes and helm access to the cluster/namespace is limited to security administrators via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).\n\n- CVE-2020-10087: GitLab before 12.8.2 allows Information Disclosure. Badge images were not being proxied, causing mixed content warnings as well as leaking the IP address of the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-32690: Helm is a tool for managing Charts (packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources). In versions of helm prior to 3.6.1, a vulnerability exists where the username and password credentials associated with a Helm repository could be passed on to another domain referenced by that Helm repository. This issue has been resolved in 3.6.1. There is a workaround through which one may check for improperly passed credentials. One may use a username and password for a Helm repository and may audit the Helm repository in order to check for another domain being used that could have received the credentials. In the `index.yaml` file for that repository, one may look for another domain in the `urls` list for the chart versions. If there is another domain found and that chart version was pulled or installed, the credentials would be passed on.\n\n- CVE-2021-32707: Nextcloud Mail is a mail app for Nextcloud. In versions prior to 1.9.6, the Nextcloud Mail application does not, by default, render images in emails to not leak the read state. The privacy filter failed to filter images with a `background-image` CSS attribute. Note that the images were still passed through the Nextcloud image proxy, and thus there was no IP leakage. The issue was patched in version 1.9.6 and 1.10.0. No workarounds are known to exist.\n\n- CVE-2020-14312: A flaw was found in the default configuration of dnsmasq, as shipped with Fedora versions prior to 31 and in all versions Red Hat Enterprise Linux, where it listens on any interface and accepts queries from addresses outside of its local subnet. In particular, the option `local-service` is not enabled. Running dnsmasq in this manner may inadvertently make it an open resolver accessible from any address on the internet. This flaw allows an attacker to conduct a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against other systems.\n\n- CVE-2021-20149: Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 does not have sufficient access controls for the WAN interface. The default iptables ruleset for governing access to services on the device only apply to IPv4. All services running on the devices are accessible via the WAN interface via IPv6 by default.\n\n- CVE-2020-1938: When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations.\n\n- CVE-2022-22547: Simple Diagnostics Agent - versions 1.0 (up to version 1.57.), allows an attacker to access information which would otherwise be restricted via a random port 9000-65535. This allows information gathering which could be used exploit future open-source security exploits.\n\n- CVE-2022-44784: An issue was discovered in Appalti & Contratti 9.12.2. The target web applications LFS and DL229 expose a set of services provided by the Axis 1.4 instance, embedded directly into the applications, as hinted by the WEB-INF/web.xml file leaked through Local File Inclusion. Among the exposed services, there is the Axis AdminService, which, through the default configuration, should normally be accessible only by the localhost. Nevertheless, by trying to access the mentioned service, both in LFS and DL229, the service can actually be reached even by remote users, allowing creation of arbitrary services on the server side. When an attacker can reach the AdminService, they can use it to instantiate arbitrary services on the server. The exploit procedure is well known and described in Generic AXIS-SSRF exploitation. Basically, the attack consists of writing a JSP page inside the root directory of the web application, through the org.apache.axis.handlers.LogHandler class.\n\n- CVE-2022-26834: Improper access control vulnerability in Rakuten Casa version AP_F_V1_4_1 or AP_F_V2_0_0 allows a remote attacker to obtain the information stored in the product because the product is set to accept HTTP connections from the WAN side by default.\n\n- CVE-2022-4390: A network misconfiguration is present in versions prior to 1.0.9.90 of the NETGEAR RAX30 AX2400 series of routers. IPv6 is enabled for the WAN interface by default on these devices. While there are firewall restrictions in place that define access restrictions for IPv4 traffic, these restrictions do not appear to be applied to the WAN interface for IPv6. This allows arbitrary access to any services running on the device that may be inadvertently listening via IPv6, such as the SSH and Telnet servers spawned on ports 22 and 23 by default. This misconfiguration could allow an attacker to interact with services only intended to be accessible by clients on the local network.\n\n- CVE-2022-45414: If a Thunderbird user quoted from an HTML email, for example by replying to the email, and the email contained either a VIDEO tag with the POSTER attribute or an OBJECT tag with a DATA attribute, a network request to the referenced remote URL was performed, regardless of a configuration to block remote content. An image loaded from the POSTER attribute was shown in the composer window. These issues could have given an attacker additional capabilities when targetting releases that did not yet have a fix for CVE-2022-3033 which was reported around three months ago. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.5.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-47717: Last Yard 22.09.8-1 is vulnerable to Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).\n\n- CVE-2022-3057: Inappropriate implementation in iframe Sandbox in Google Chrome prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-31055: kCTF is a Kubernetes-based infrastructure for capture the flag (CTF) competitions. Prior to version 1.6.0, the kctf cluster set-src-ip-ranges was broken and allowed traffic from any IP. The problem has been patched in v1.6.0. As a workaround, those who want to test challenges privately can mark them as `public: false` and use `kctf chal debug port-forward` to connect.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",

This vulnerability occurs because the default configuration is applied for console authentication and authorization. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the console port and authenticating as a read-only user. A successful exploit could allow a user with read-only permissions to access administrative privileges.\n\n- CVE-2021-1447: A vulnerability in the user account management system of Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate their privileges to root. This vulnerability is due to a procedural flaw in the password generation algorithm. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by enabling specific Administrator-only features and connecting to the appliance through the CLI with elevated privileges. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root and access the underlying operating system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid Administrator credentials.\n\n- CVE-2021-25362: An improper permission management in CertInstaller prior to SMR APR-2021 Release 1 allows untrusted applications to delete certain local files.\n\n- CVE-2021-34766: A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem (SSM On-Prem) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges and create, read, update, or delete records and settings in multiple functions. This vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization of the System User and System Operator role capabilities. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by directly accessing a web resource. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to create, read, update, or delete records and settings in multiple functions without the necessary permissions on the web UI.\n\n- CVE-2021-23893: Privilege Escalation vulnerability in a Windows system driver of McAfee Drive Encryption (DE) prior to 7.3.0 could allow a local non-admin user to gain elevated system privileges via exploiting an unutilized memory buffer.\n\n- CVE-2021-21567: Dell PowerScale OneFS 9.1.0.x contains an improper privilege management vulnerability.

        "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved block Prevent potential deadlocks in zone write plug error recovery Zone write plugging for handling writes to zones of a zoned block device always execute a zone report whenever a write BIO to a zone fails. The intent of this is to ensure that the tracking of a zone write pointer is always correct to ensure that the alignment to a zone write pointer of write BIOs can be checked on submission and that we can always correctly emulate zone append operations using regular write BIOs. However, this error recovery scheme introduces a potential deadlock if a device queue freeze is initiated while BIOs are still plugged in a zone write plug and one of these write operation fails. In such case, the disk zone write plug error recovery work is scheduled and executes a report zone. This in turn can result in a request allocation in the underlying driver to issue the report zones command to the device. But with the device queue freeze already started, this allocation will block, preventing the report zone execution and the continuation of the processing of the plugged BIOs. As plugged BIOs hold a queue usage reference, the queue freeze itself will never complete, resulting in a deadlock. Avoid this problem by completely removing from the zone write plugging code the use of report zones operations after a failed write operation, instead relying on the device user to either execute a report zones, reset the zone, finish the zone, or give up writing to the device (which is a fairly common pattern for file systems which degrade to read-only after write failures). This is not an unreasonnable requirement as all well-behaved applications, FSes and device mapper already use report zones to recover from write errors whenever possible by comparing the current position of a zone write pointer with what their assumption about the position is. The changes to remove the automatic error recovery are as follows - Completely remove the error recovery work and its associated resources (zone write plug list head, disk error list, and disk zone_wplugs_work work struct). This also removes the functions disk_zone_wplug_set_error() and disk_zone_wplug_clear_error(). - Change the BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_ERROR zone write plug flag into BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE. This new flag is set for a zone write plug whenever a write opration targetting the zone of the zone write plug fails. This flag indicates that the zone write pointer offset is not reliable and that it must be updated when the next report zone, reset zone, finish zone or disk revalidation is executed. - Modify blk_zone_write_plug_bio_endio() to set the BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE flag for the target zone of a failed write BIO. - Modify the function disk_zone_wplug_set_wp_offset() to clear this new flag, thus implementing recovery of a correct write pointer offset with the reset (all) zone and finish zone operations. - Modify blkdev_report_zones() to always use the disk_report_zones_cb() callback so that disk_zone_wplug_sync_wp_offset() can be called for any zone marked with the BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE flag. This implements recovery of a correct write pointer offset for zone write plugs marked with BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE and within the range of the report zones operation executed by the user. - Modify blk_revalidate_seq_zone() to call disk_zone_wplug_sync_wp_offset() for all sequential write required zones when a zoned block device is revalidated, thus always resolving any inconsistency between the write pointer offset of zone write plugs and the actual write pointer position of sequential zones.",

    "enhanced_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved block Prevent **potential deadlocks** in zone write plug error recovery Zone write plugging for handling writes to zones of a zoned block device always execute a zone report whenever a write BIO to a zone fails. The intent of this is to ensure that the tracking of a zone write pointer is always correct to ensure that the alignment to a zone write pointer of write BIOs can be checked on submission and that we can always correctly emulate zone append operations using regular write BIOs. However, this error recovery scheme introduces a potential deadlock if a device queue freeze is initiated while BIOs are still plugged in a zone write plug and one of these write operation fails. In such case, the disk zone write plug error recovery work is scheduled and executes a report zone. This in turn can result in a request allocation in the underlying driver to issue the report zones command to the device. But with the device queue freeze already started, this allocation will block, preventing the report zone execution and the continuation of the processing of the plugged BIOs. As plugged BIOs hold a queue usage reference, the queue freeze itself will never complete, resulting in a deadlock. Avoid this problem by completely removing from the zone write plugging code the use of report zones operations after a failed write operation, instead relying on the device user to either execute a report zones, reset the zone, finish the zone, or give up writing to the device (which is a fairly common pattern for file systems which degrade to read-only after write failures). This is not an unreasonnable requirement as all well-behaved applications, FSes and device mapper already use report zones to recover from write errors whenever possible by comparing the current position of a zone write pointer with what their assumption about the position is. The changes to remove the automatic error recovery are as follows - Completely remove the error recovery work and its associated resources (zone write plug list head, disk error list, and disk zone_wplugs_work work struct). This also removes the functions disk_zone_wplug_set_error() and disk_zone_wplug_clear_error(). - Change the BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_ERROR zone write plug flag into BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE. This new flag is set for a zone write plug whenever a write opration targetting the zone of the zone write plug fails. This flag indicates that the zone write pointer offset is not reliable and that it must be updated when the next report zone, reset zone, finish zone or disk revalidation is executed. - Modify blk_zone_write_plug_bio_endio() to set the BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE flag for the target zone of a failed write BIO. - Modify the function disk_zone_wplug_set_wp_offset() to clear this new flag, thus implementing recovery of a correct write pointer offset with the reset (all) zone and finish zone operations. - Modify blkdev_report_zones() to always use the disk_report_zones_cb() callback so that disk_zone_wplug_sync_wp_offset() can be called for any zone marked with the BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE flag. This implements recovery of a correct write pointer offset for zone write plugs marked with BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE and within the range of the report zones operation executed by the user. - Modify blk_revalidate_seq_zone() to call disk_zone_wplug_sync_wp_offset() for all sequential write required zones when a zoned block device is revalidated, thus always resolving any inconsistency between the write pointer offset of zone write plugs and the actual write pointer position of sequential zones.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **potential deadlocks**\n- **product:** Linux kernel\n- **component:** zone write plug error recovery\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | Base | Allowed | sparse | 2.768 |\n| 2 | 367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | Base | Allowed | sparse | 2.728 |\n| 3 | 667 | Improper Locking | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 2.636 |\n| 4 | 1285 | Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input | Base | Allowed | sparse | 2.612 |\n| 5 | 119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 2.605 |\n| 6 | 833 | Deadlock | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.496 |\n| 7 | 609 | Double-Checked Locking | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.003 |\n| 8 | 787 | Out-of-bounds Write | Base | Allowed | sparse | 2.603 |\n| 9 | 126 | Buffer Over-read | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 2.602 |\n| 10 | 362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 2.576 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nRetrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.\n\n\nFor example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.\n\n\nOne manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nInsecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The \"Insecure Direct Object Reference\" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.\nBroken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.\nHorizontal Authorization: \"Horizontal Authorization\" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-863\nChildOf -> CWE-863\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-36539:** An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nTOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to \"Time Of Check To Time Of Use\".\nTOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-362\nChildOf -> CWE-362\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed\n- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.\n- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nLocking is a type of synchronization behavior that ensures that multiple independently-operating processes or threads do not interfere with each other when accessing the same resource. All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms. Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency, race conditions, reentrant functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667, CWE-820, CWE-821, and others - may need to be modified significantly, along with their relationships.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2009-0935:** Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice\n- **CVE-2010-4210:** function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nOften, indexable resources such as memory buffers or files can be accessed using a specific position, index, or offset, such as an index for an array or a position for a file. When untrusted input is not properly validated before it is used as an index, attackers could access (or attempt to access) unauthorized portions of these resources. This could be used to cause buffer overflows, excessive resource allocation, or trigger unexpected failures. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-20\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2005-0369:** large ID in packet used as array index\n- **CVE-2001-1009:** negative array index as argument to POP LIST command\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nBuffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean \"write past the end of a buffer,\" whereas others use the same term to mean \"any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer.\" Others could mean \"any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write.\" Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.\nbuffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term \"buffer overrun,\" but most people use \"buffer overflow.\" See the alternate term for \"buffer overflow\" for context.\nmemory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the \"memory safety\" term.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-118\nChildOf -> CWE-20\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.\n**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Applicable Platform]** \n\nIt is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-833: Deadlock\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-667\nChildOf -> CWE-662\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1476:** A bug in some Intel Pentium processors allow DoS (hang) via an invalid \"CMPXCHG8B\" instruction, causing a deadlock\n- **CVE-2009-2857:** OS deadlock\n- **CVE-2009-1961:** OS deadlock involving 3 separate functions\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-609: Double-Checked Locking\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses double-checked locking to access a resource without the overhead of explicit synchronization, but the locking is insufficient.\n\n### Extended Description\nDouble-checked locking refers to the situation where a programmer checks to see if a resource has been initialized, grabs a lock, checks again to see if the resource has been initialized, and then performs the initialization if it has not occurred yet. This should not be done, as it is not guaranteed to work in all languages and on all architectures. In summary, other threads may not be operating inside the synchronous block and are not guaranteed to see the operations execute in the same order as they would appear inside the synchronous block.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-667\nCanPrecede -> CWE-367\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-1017:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to write 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.\n- **CVE-2021-21220:** Chain: insufficient input validation (CWE-20) in browser allows heap corruption (CWE-787), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-28664:** GPU kernel driver allows memory corruption because a user can obtain read/write access to read-only pages, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis typically occurs when the pointer or its index is incremented to a position beyond the bounds of the buffer or when pointer arithmetic results in a position outside of the valid memory location to name a few. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-125\nChildOf -> CWE-788\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** These problems may be resultant from missing sentinel values (CWE-463) or trusting a user-influenced input length variable.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-1733:** Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code\n- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: \"Heartbleed\" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.\n- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nA race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.\n\n\nA race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:\n\n\n  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.\n\n  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.\n\nA race condition exists when an \"interfering code sequence\" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.\n\nThe interfering code sequence could be \"trusted\" or \"untrusted.\" A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nRace Condition\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-691\nCanPrecede -> CWE-416\nCanPrecede -> CWE-476\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.\n\n**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n",

This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nRetrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.\n\n\nFor example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.\n\n\nOne manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-36539: An educational application does not appropriately restrict file IDs to a particular user. The attacker can brute-force guess IDs, indicating IDOR.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-26679: vFairs 3.3 is affected by Insecure Permissions.

Several APIs on the web system display, without authorization, sensitive information such as health statements, previous bills in a specific restaurant, alcohol consumption and smoking habits. Each of the described API\u2019s, has in its URL one or more MongoDB ID which is not so simple to enumerate. However, they each receive a \u2018tiny URL\u2019 in Tabit\u2019s domain, in the form of https://tbit.be/{suffix} with suffix being a 5 characters long string containing numbers, lower- and upper-case letters. It is not so simple to enumerate them all, but really easy to find some that work and lead to a personal endpoint. This is both an example of OWASP: API4 - rate limiting and OWASP: API1 - Broken object level authorization. Furthermore, the redirect URL disclosed the MongoDB IDs discussed above, and we could use them to query other endpoints disclosing more personal information. For example: The URL https://tabitisrael.co.il/online-reservations/health-statement?orgId={org_id}&healthStatementId={health_statement_id} is used to invite friends to fill a health statement before attending the restaurant. We can use the health_statement_id to access the https://tgm-api.tabit.cloud/health-statement/{health_statement_id} API which disclose medical information as well as id number.\n\n- CVE-2022-36202: Doctor's Appointment System1.0 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control via edoc/patient/settings.php.

A sync token is used in Seafile file syncing protocol to authorize access to library data. To improve performance, the token is cached in memory in seaf-server. Upon receiving a token from sync client or SeaDrive client, the server checks whether the token exist in the cache. However, if the token exists in cache, the server doesn't check whether it's associated with the specific library in the URL. This vulnerability makes it possible to use any valid sync token to access data from any **known** library. Note that the attacker has to first find out the ID of a library which it has no access to. The library ID is a random UUID, which is not possible to be guessed. There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-1949: An access control bypass vulnerability found in 389-ds-base.

A local unprivileged user could use this flaw to bypass the checks that were introduced in response to CVE-2017-7500 and CVE-2017-7501, potentially gaining root privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-0280: A race condition vulnerability exists in the QuickClean feature of McAfee Total Protection for Windows prior to 16.0.43 that allows a local user to gain privilege elevation and perform an arbitrary file delete. This could lead to sensitive files being deleted and potentially cause denial of service. This attack exploits the way symlinks are created and how the product works with them.\n\n- CVE-2022-0915: There is a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition Vulnerability in Logitech Sync for Windows prior to 2.4.574. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may escalate the permission to the system user.\n\n- CVE-2022-21198: Time-of-check time-of-use race condition in the BIOS firmware for some Intel(R) Processors may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\n\n- CVE-2022-23651: b2-sdk-python is a python library to access cloud storage provided by backblaze. Linux and Mac releases of the SDK version 1.14.0 and below contain a key disclosure vulnerability that, in certain conditions, can be exploited by local attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. SDK users of the SqliteAccountInfo format are vulnerable while users of the InMemoryAccountInfo format are safe. The SqliteAccountInfo saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping) in a local database file ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info, ~/.b2_account_info or a user-defined path). When first created, the file is world readable and is (typically a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the user. If the directory containing the file is readable by a local attacker then during the brief period between file creation and permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file and maintain a handle to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents after the file after the sensitive information has been saved to it. Consumers of this SDK who rely on it to save data using SqliteAccountInfo class should upgrade to the latest version of the SDK. Those who believe a local user might have opened a handle using this race condition, should remove the affected database files and regenerate all application keys. Users should upgrade to b2-sdk-python 1.14.1 or later.\n\n- CVE-2022-23653: B2 Command Line Tool is the official command line tool for the backblaze cloud storage service. Linux and Mac releases of the B2 command-line tool version 3.2.0 and below contain a key disclosure vulnerability that, in certain conditions, can be exploited by local attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. The command line tool saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping) in a local database file (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info`, `~/.b2_account_info` or a user-defined path) when `b2 authorize-account` is first run. This happens regardless of whether a valid key is provided or not. When first created, the file is world readable and is (typically a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the user. If the directory is readable by a local attacker and the user did not yet run `b2 authorize-account` then during the brief period between file creation and permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file and maintain a handle to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents after the file after the sensitive information has been saved to it. Users that have not yet run `b2 authorize-account` should upgrade to B2 Command-Line Tool v3.2.1 before running it. Users that have run `b2 authorize-account` are safe if at the time of the file creation no other local users had read access to the local configuration file. Users that have run `b2 authorize-account` where the designated path could be opened by another local user should upgrade to B2 Command-Line Tool v3.2.1 and remove the database and regenerate all application keys. Note that `b2 clear-account` does not remove the database file and it should not be used to ensure that all open handles to the file are invalidated. If B2 Command-Line Tool cannot be upgraded to v3.2.1 due to a dependency conflict, a binary release can be used instead. Alternatively a new version could be installed within a virtualenv, or the permissions can be changed to prevent local users from opening the database file.\n\n- CVE-2022-25165: An issue was discovered in Amazon AWS VPN Client 2.0.0. A TOCTOU race condition exists during the validation of VPN configuration files. This allows parameters outside of the AWS VPN Client allow list to be injected into the configuration file prior to the AWS VPN Client service (running as SYSTEM) processing the file. Dangerous arguments can be injected by a low-level user such as log, which allows an arbitrary destination to be specified for writing log files. This leads to an arbitrary file write as SYSTEM with partial control over the files content. This can be abused to cause an elevation of privilege or denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2022-26859: Dell BIOS contains a race condition vulnerability. A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious input via SMI in order to bypass security checks during SMM.\n\n- CVE-2022-28743: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulerability in Foscam R2C IP camera running System FW <= 1.13.1.6, and Application FW <= 2.91.2.66, allows an authenticated remote attacker with administrator permissions to execute arbitrary remote code via a malicious firmware patch. The impact of this vulnerability is that the remote attacker could gain full remote access to the IP camera and the underlying Linux system with root permissions. With root access to the camera's Linux OS, an attacker could effectively change the code that is running, add backdoor access, or invade the privacy of the user by accessing the live camera stream.\n\n- CVE-2022-29800: A time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition vulnerability was found in networkd-dispatcher. This flaw exists because there is a certain time between the scripts being discovered and them being run. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to replace scripts that networkd-dispatcher believes to be owned by root with ones that are not.\n\n- CVE-2022-31466: Time of Check - Time of Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability in Quick Heal Total Security prior to 12.1.1.27 allows a local attacker to achieve privilege escalation, potentially leading to deletion of system files. This is achieved through exploiting the time between detecting a file as malicious and when the action of quarantining or cleaning is performed, and using the time to replace the malicious file by a symlink.\n\n- CVE-2022-33691: A possible race condition vulnerability in score driver prior to SMR Jul-2022 Release 1 can allow local attackers to interleave malicious operations.\n\n- CVE-2022-34830: An Arm product family through 2022-06-29 has a TOCTOU Race Condition that allows non-privileged user to make improper GPU processing operations to gain access to already freed memory.\n\n- CVE-2022-34899: This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Parallels Access 6.5.4 (39316) Agent. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target host system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the Parallels service. By creating a symbolic link, an attacker can abuse the service to execute a file. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-16134.\n\n- CVE-2022-3590: WordPress is affected by an unauthenticated blind SSRF in the pingback feature. Because of a TOCTOU race condition between the validation checks and the HTTP request, attackers can reach internal hosts that are explicitly forbidden.\n\n- CVE-2022-45842: Unauth. Race Condition vulnerability in WP ULike Plugin <= 4.6.4 on WordPress allows attackers to increase/decrease rating scores. \n\n- CVE-2022-1537: file.copy operations in GruntJS are vulnerable to a TOCTOU race condition leading to arbitrary file write in GitHub repository gruntjs/grunt prior to 1.5.3. This vulnerability is capable of arbitrary file writes which can lead to local privilege escalation to the GruntJS user if a lower-privileged user has write access to both source and destination directories as the lower-privileged user can create a symlink to the GruntJS user's .bashrc file or replace /etc/shadow file if the GruntJS user is root.\n\n- CVE-2022-21658: Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the `std::fs::remove_dir_all` standard library function is vulnerable a race condition enabling symlink following (CWE-363). An attacker could use this security issue to trick a privileged program into deleting files and directories the attacker couldn't otherwise access or delete. Rust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.58.0 is affected by this vulnerability with 1.58.1 containing a patch. Note that the following build targets don't have usable APIs to properly mitigate the attack, and are thus still vulnerable even with a patched toolchain: macOS before version 10.10 (Yosemite) and REDOX. We recommend everyone to update to Rust 1.58.1 as soon as possible, especially people developing programs expected to run in privileged contexts (including system daemons and setuid binaries), as those have the highest risk of being affected by this. Note that adding checks in your codebase before calling remove_dir_all will not mitigate the vulnerability, as they would also be vulnerable to race conditions like remove_dir_all itself. The existing mitigation is working as intended outside of race conditions.\n\n- CVE-2022-23563: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. In multiple places, TensorFlow uses `tempfile.mktemp` to create temporary files. While this is acceptable in testing, in utilities and libraries it is dangerous as a different process can create the file between the check for the filename in `mktemp` and the actual creation of the file by a subsequent operation (a TOC/TOU type of weakness). In several instances, TensorFlow was supposed to actually create a temporary directory instead of a file. This logic bug is hidden away by the `mktemp` function usage. We have patched the issue in several commits, replacing `mktemp` with the safer `mkstemp`/`mkdtemp` functions, according to the usage pattern. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-4098: Insufficient data validation in Mojo in Google Chrome prior to 96.0.4664.110 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to potentially perform a sandbox escape via a crafted HTML page.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-362 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-362 (ChildOf)",

All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2009-0935: Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice\n\n- CVE-2010-4210: function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.\n\n- CVE-2008-4302: Chain: OS kernel does not properly handle a failure of a function call (CWE-755), leading to an unlock of a resource that was not locked (CWE-832), with resultant crash.\n\n- CVE-2009-1243: OS kernel performs an unlock in some incorrect circumstances, leading to panic.\n\n- CVE-2009-2857: OS deadlock\n\n- CVE-2009-1961: OS deadlock involving 3 separate functions\n\n- CVE-2009-2699: deadlock in library\n\n- CVE-2009-4272: deadlock triggered by packets that force collisions in a routing table\n\n- CVE-2002-1850: read/write deadlock between web server and script\n\n- CVE-2004-0174: web server deadlock involving multiple listening connections\n\n- CVE-2009-1388: multiple simultaneous calls to the same function trigger deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2006-5158: chain: other weakness leads to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) or deadlock (CWE-833).\n\n- CVE-2006-4342: deadlock when an operation is performed on a resource while it is being removed.\n\n- CVE-2006-2374: Deadlock in device driver triggered by using file handle of a related device.\n\n- CVE-2006-2275: Deadlock when large number of small messages cannot be processed quickly enough.\n\n- CVE-2005-3847: OS kernel has deadlock triggered by a signal during a core dump.\n\n- CVE-2005-3106: Race condition leads to deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2005-2456: Chain: array index error (CWE-129) leads to deadlock (CWE-833)\n\n- CVE-2001-0682: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a mutex.\n\n- CVE-2002-1914: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.\n\n- CVE-2002-1915: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.\n\n- CVE-2002-0051: Critical file can be opened with exclusive read access by user, preventing application of security policy.

A malicious application may be able to elevate privileges. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited..\n\n- CVE-2021-31961: Windows InstallService Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26708: A local privilege escalation was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.10.13. Multiple race conditions in the AF_VSOCK implementation are caused by wrong locking in net/vmw_vsock/af_vsock.c. The race conditions were implicitly introduced in the commits that added VSOCK multi-transport support.\n\n- CVE-2021-0330: In add_user_ce and remove_user_ce of storaged.cpp, there is a possible use-after-free due to improper locking.

The fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris). The fix is very small and a git patch is available for those using unsupported versions of Puma.\n\n- CVE-2021-4001: A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's ebpf verifier between bpf_map_update_elem and bpf_map_freeze due to a missing lock in kernel/bpf/syscall.c. In this flaw, a local user with a special privilege (cap_sys_admin or cap_bpf) can modify the frozen mapped address space. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.16 rc2.\n\n- CVE-2021-41141: PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in the C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In various parts of PJSIP, when error/failure occurs, it is found that the function returns without releasing the currently held locks. This could result in a system deadlock, which cause a denial of service for the users. No release has yet been made which contains the linked fix commit. All versions up to an including 2.11.1 are affected. Users may need to manually apply the patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-4149: A vulnerability was found in btrfs_alloc_tree_b in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c in the Linux kernel due to an improper lock operation in btrfs. In this flaw, a user with a local privilege may cause a denial of service (DOS) due to a deadlock problem.\n\n- CVE-2022-20016: In vow driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking.

This could lead to local denial of service in kernel.\n\n- CVE-2022-42775: In camera driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local denial of service in kernel.\n\n- CVE-2022-26356: Racy interactions between dirty vram tracking and paging log dirty hypercalls Activation of log dirty mode done by XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram (was named HVMOP_track_dirty_vram before Xen 4.9) is racy with ongoing log dirty hypercalls. A suitably timed call to XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram can enable log dirty while another CPU is still in the process of tearing down the structures related to a previously enabled log dirty mode (XEN_DOMCTL_SHADOW_OP_OFF). This is due to lack of mutually exclusive locking between both operations and can lead to entries being added in already freed slots, resulting in a memory leak.\n\n- CVE-2021-0147: Improper locking in the Power Management Controller (PMC) for some Intel Chipset firmware before versions pmc_fw_lbg_c1-21ww02a and pmc_fw_lbg_b0-21ww02a may allow a privileged user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-39640: In __dwc3_gadget_ep0_queue of ep0.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to improper locking.

The implementation of `tf.io.decode_raw` produces incorrect results and crashes the Python interpreter when combining `fixed_length` and wider datatypes. The implementation of the padded version(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc) is buggy due to a confusion about pointer arithmetic rules. First, the code computes(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L61) the width of each output element by dividing the `fixed_length` value to the size of the type argument. The `fixed_length` argument is also used to determine the size needed for the output tensor(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L63-L79). This is followed by reencoding code(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L85-L94). The erroneous code is the last line above: it is moving the `out_data` pointer by `fixed_length * sizeof(T)` bytes whereas it only copied at most `fixed_length` bytes from the input. This results in parts of the input not being decoded into the output. Furthermore, because the pointer advance is far wider than desired, this quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data. This OOB write leads to interpreter crash in the reproducer mentioned here, but more severe attacks can be mounted too, given that this gadget allows writing to periodically placed locations in memory. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29947: Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 87.

This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-1733: Text editor has out-of-bounds read past end of line while indenting C code\n\n- CVE-2014-0160: Chain: \"Heartbleed\" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.\n\n- CVE-2009-2523: Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated, leading to buffer over-read or heap-based buffer overflow.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-18775: In Libav 12.3, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in vc1_decode_b_mb_intfi in vc1_block.c that allows an attacker to cause denial-of-service via a crafted file.\n\n- CVE-2020-18778: In Libav 12.3, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in vc1_decode_p_mb_intfi in vc1_block.c that allows an attacker to cause denial-of-service via a crafted file.\n\n- CVE-2020-24119: A heap buffer overflow read was discovered in upx 4.0.0, because the check in p_lx_elf.cpp is not perfect.\n\n- CVE-2020-27824: A flaw was found in OpenJPEG\u2019s encoder in the opj_dwt_calc_explicit_stepsizes() function. This flaw allows an attacker who can supply crafted input to decomposition levels to cause a buffer overflow. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-1404: A vulnerability in the PDF parsing module in Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.103.0 and 0.103.1 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper buffer size tracking that may result in a heap buffer over-read. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PDF file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to crash, resulting in a denial of service condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-1952: Possible buffer over read occurs due to lack of length check of request buffer in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Voice & Music\n\n- CVE-2021-1977: Possible buffer over read due to improper validation of frame length while processing AEAD decryption during ASSOC response in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer Electronics Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon IoT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music\n\n- CVE-2021-25216: In BIND 9.5.0 -> 9.11.29, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.13, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -> 9.11.29-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.13-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition, as well as release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.1 of the BIND 9.17 development branch, BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and are configured to use GSS-TSIG features. In a configuration which uses BIND's default settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credential configuration options. Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers. For servers that meet these conditions, the ISC SPNEGO implementation is vulnerable to various attacks, depending on the CPU architecture for which BIND was built: For named binaries compiled for 64-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a buffer over-read, leading to a server crash. For named binaries compiled for 32-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a server crash due to a buffer overflow and possibly also to achieve remote code execution. We have determined that standard SPNEGO implementations are available in the MIT and Heimdal Kerberos libraries, which support a broad range of operating systems, rendering the ISC implementation unnecessary and obsolete. Therefore, to reduce the attack surface for BIND users, we will be removing the ISC SPNEGO implementation in the April releases of BIND 9.11 and 9.16 (it had already been dropped from BIND 9.17). We would not normally remove something from a stable ESV (Extended Support Version) of BIND, but since system libraries can replace the ISC SPNEGO implementation, we have made an exception in this case for reasons of stability and security.\n\n- CVE-2021-33590: GattLib 0.3-rc1 has a stack-based buffer over-read in get_device_path_from_mac in dbus/gattlib.c.\n\n- CVE-2021-1648: Microsoft splwow64 Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2020-11159: Buffer over-read can happen while processing WPA,RSN IE of beacon and response frames if IE length is less than length of frame pointer being accessed in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer Electronics Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon IoT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wired Infrastructure and Networking\n\n- CVE-2020-11285: Buffer over-read while unpacking the RTCP packet we may read extra byte if wrong length is provided in RTCP packets in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon IoT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2020-18771: Exiv2 0.27.99.0 has a global buffer over-read in Exiv2::Internal::Nikon1MakerNote::print0x0088 in nikonmn_int.cpp which can result in an information leak.\n\n- CVE-2020-19750: An issue was discovered in gpac 0.8.0.

Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.\n\n\nA race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:\n\n\n  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.\n\n  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.\n\nA race condition exists when an \"interfering code sequence\" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.\n\nThe interfering code sequence could be \"trusted\" or \"untrusted.\" A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-29527: Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2021-0920: Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-6819: Chain: race condition (CWE-362) leads to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2019-18827: chain: JTAG interface is not disabled (CWE-1191) during ROM code execution, introducing a race condition (CWE-362) to extract encryption keys\n\n- CVE-2019-1161: Chain: race condition (CWE-362) in anti-malware product allows deletion of files by creating a junction (CWE-1386) and using hard links during the time window in which a temporary file is created and deleted.\n\n- CVE-2015-1743: TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed\n\n- CVE-2014-8273: Chain: chipset has a race condition (CWE-362) between when an interrupt handler detects an attempt to write-enable the BIOS (in violation of the lock bit), and when the handler resets the write-enable bit back to 0, allowing attackers to issue BIOS writes during the timing window [REF-1237].\n\n- CVE-2008-5044: Race condition leading to a crash by calling a hook removal procedure while other activities are occurring at the same time.\n\n- CVE-2008-2958: chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.\n\n- CVE-2008-1570: chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.\n\n- CVE-2008-0058: Unsynchronized caching operation enables a race condition that causes messages to be sent to a deallocated object.\n\n- CVE-2008-0379: Race condition during initialization triggers a buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2007-6599: Daemon crash by quickly performing operations and undoing them, which eventually leads to an operation that does not acquire a lock.\n\n- CVE-2007-6180: chain: race condition triggers NULL pointer dereference\n\n- CVE-2007-5794: Race condition in library function could cause data to be sent to the wrong process.\n\n- CVE-2007-3970: Race condition in file parser leads to heap corruption.\n\n- CVE-2008-5021: chain: race condition allows attacker to access an object while it is still being initialized, causing software to access uninitialized memory.\n\n- CVE-2009-4895: chain: race condition for an argument value, possibly resulting in NULL dereference\n\n- CVE-2009-3547: chain: race condition might allow resource to be released before operating on it, leading to NULL dereference\n\n- CVE-2006-5051: Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-6388: Out of bounds access in WebAudio in Google Chrome prior to 80.0.3987.87 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-0366: In vpu, there is a possible memory corruption due to a race condition.

The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, get de-allocated when a guest switched (back) from v2 to v1. The freeing of such pages requires that the hypervisor know where in the guest these pages were mapped. The hypervisor tracks only one use within guest space, but racing requests from the guest to insert mappings of these pages may result in any of them to become mapped in multiple locations. Upon switching back from v2 to v1, the guest would then retain access to a page that was freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes.\n\n- CVE-2021-28701: Another race in XENMAPSPACE_grant_table handling Guests are permitted access to certain Xen-owned pages of memory.

        "matched_text": "CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n\nType: Class\n\nStatus: Incomplete\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nAttackers might be able to spoof the intended endpoint from a different system or process, thus gaining the same level of access as the intended endpoint.\n\n\nWhile this issue frequently involves authentication between network-based clients and servers, other types of communication channels and endpoints can have this weakness.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-30319: S-bus functionality in a home automation product performs access control using an IP allowlist, which can be bypassed by a forged IP address.\n\n- CVE-2022-22547: A troubleshooting tool exposes a web server on a random port between 9000-65535 that could be used for information gathering\n\n- CVE-2022-4390: A WAN interface on a router has firewall restrictions enabled for IPv4, but it does not for IPv6, which is enabled by default\n\n- CVE-2012-2292: Product has a Silverlight cross-domain policy that does not restrict access to another application, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy.\n\n- CVE-2012-5810: Mobile banking application does not verify hostname, leading to financial loss.\n\n- CVE-2014-1266: chain: incorrect \"goto\" in Apple SSL product bypasses certificate validation, allowing Adversry-in-the-Middle (AITM) attack (Apple \"goto fail\" bug). CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).\n\n- CVE-2000-1218: DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query, leading to cache poisoning\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-29416: An issue was discovered in PortSwigger Burp Suite before 2021.2. During viewing of a malicious request, it can be manipulated into issuing a request that does not respect its upstream proxy configuration. This could leak NetNTLM hashes on Windows systems that fail to block outbound SMB.\n\n- CVE-2021-30127: TerraMaster F2-210 devices through 2021-04-03 use UPnP to make the admin web server accessible over the Internet on TCP port 8181, which is arguably inconsistent with the \"It is only available on the local network\" documentation. NOTE: manually editing /etc/upnp.json provides a partial but undocumented workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31810: An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.6.7, 2.7.x through 2.7.3, and 3.x through 3.0.1. A malicious FTP server can use the PASV response to trick Net::FTP into connecting back to a given IP address and port. This potentially makes curl extract information about services that are otherwise private and not disclosed (e.g., the attacker can conduct port scans and service banner extractions).\n\n- CVE-2021-20999: In Weidm\u00fcller u-controls and IoT-Gateways in versions up to 1.12.1 a network port intended only for device-internal usage is accidentally accessible via external network interfaces. By exploiting this vulnerability the device may be manipulated or the operation may be stopped.\n\n- CVE-2021-21210: Inappropriate implementation in Network in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.72 allowed a remote attacker to potentially access local UDP ports via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-42343: An issue was discovered in the Dask distributed package before 2021.10.0 for Python. Single machine Dask clusters started with dask.distributed.LocalCluster or dask.distributed.Client (which defaults to using LocalCluster) would mistakenly configure their respective Dask workers to listen on external interfaces (typically with a randomly selected high port) rather than only on localhost. A Dask cluster created using this method (when running on a machine that has an applicable port exposed) could be used by a sophisticated attacker to achieve remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2021-22916: In Brave Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.26.60, when adblocking is enabled and a proxy browser extension is installed, the CNAME adblocking feature issues DNS requests that used the system DNS settings instead of the extension's proxy settings, resulting in possible information disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2021-22917: Brave Browser Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.20 is vulnerable to information disclosure by way of DNS requests in Tor windows not flowing through Tor if adblocking was enabled.\n\n- CVE-2020-4062: In Conjur OSS Helm Chart before 2.0.0, a recently identified critical vulnerability resulted in the installation of the Conjur Postgres database with an open port. This allows an attacker to gain full read & write access to the Conjur Postgres database, including escalating the attacker's privileges to assume full control. A malicious actor who knows the IP address and port number of the Postgres database and has access into the Kubernetes cluster where Conjur runs can gain full read & write access to the Postgres database. This enables the attacker to write a policy that allows full access to retrieve any secret. This Helm chart is a method to install Conjur OSS into a Kubernetes environment. Hence, the systems impacted are only Conjur OSS systems that were deployed using this chart. Other deployments including Docker and the CyberArk Dynamic Access Provider (DAP) are not affected. To remediate this vulnerability, clone the latest Helm Chart and follow the upgrade instructions. If you are not able to fully remediate this vulnerability immediately, you can mitigate some of the risk by making sure Conjur OSS is deployed on an isolated Kubernetes cluster or namespace. The term \"isolated\" refers to: - No other workloads besides Conjur OSS and its backend database are running in that Kubernetes cluster/namespace. - Kubernetes and helm access to the cluster/namespace is limited to security administrators via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).\n\n- CVE-2020-10087: GitLab before 12.8.2 allows Information Disclosure. Badge images were not being proxied, causing mixed content warnings as well as leaking the IP address of the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-32690: Helm is a tool for managing Charts (packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources). In versions of helm prior to 3.6.1, a vulnerability exists where the username and password credentials associated with a Helm repository could be passed on to another domain referenced by that Helm repository. This issue has been resolved in 3.6.1. There is a workaround through which one may check for improperly passed credentials. One may use a username and password for a Helm repository and may audit the Helm repository in order to check for another domain being used that could have received the credentials. In the `index.yaml` file for that repository, one may look for another domain in the `urls` list for the chart versions. If there is another domain found and that chart version was pulled or installed, the credentials would be passed on.\n\n- CVE-2021-32707: Nextcloud Mail is a mail app for Nextcloud. In versions prior to 1.9.6, the Nextcloud Mail application does not, by default, render images in emails to not leak the read state. The privacy filter failed to filter images with a `background-image` CSS attribute. Note that the images were still passed through the Nextcloud image proxy, and thus there was no IP leakage. The issue was patched in version 1.9.6 and 1.10.0. No workarounds are known to exist.\n\n- CVE-2020-14312: A flaw was found in the default configuration of dnsmasq, as shipped with Fedora versions prior to 31 and in all versions Red Hat Enterprise Linux, where it listens on any interface and accepts queries from addresses outside of its local subnet. In particular, the option `local-service` is not enabled. Running dnsmasq in this manner may inadvertently make it an open resolver accessible from any address on the internet. This flaw allows an attacker to conduct a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against other systems.\n\n- CVE-2021-20149: Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 does not have sufficient access controls for the WAN interface. The default iptables ruleset for governing access to services on the device only apply to IPv4. All services running on the devices are accessible via the WAN interface via IPv6 by default.\n\n- CVE-2020-1938: When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations.\n\n- CVE-2022-22547: Simple Diagnostics Agent - versions 1.0 (up to version 1.57.), allows an attacker to access information which would otherwise be restricted via a random port 9000-65535. This allows information gathering which could be used exploit future open-source security exploits.\n\n- CVE-2022-44784: An issue was discovered in Appalti & Contratti 9.12.2. The target web applications LFS and DL229 expose a set of services provided by the Axis 1.4 instance, embedded directly into the applications, as hinted by the WEB-INF/web.xml file leaked through Local File Inclusion. Among the exposed services, there is the Axis AdminService, which, through the default configuration, should normally be accessible only by the localhost. Nevertheless, by trying to access the mentioned service, both in LFS and DL229, the service can actually be reached even by remote users, allowing creation of arbitrary services on the server side. When an attacker can reach the AdminService, they can use it to instantiate arbitrary services on the server. The exploit procedure is well known and described in Generic AXIS-SSRF exploitation. Basically, the attack consists of writing a JSP page inside the root directory of the web application, through the org.apache.axis.handlers.LogHandler class.\n\n- CVE-2022-26834: Improper access control vulnerability in Rakuten Casa version AP_F_V1_4_1 or AP_F_V2_0_0 allows a remote attacker to obtain the information stored in the product because the product is set to accept HTTP connections from the WAN side by default.\n\n- CVE-2022-4390: A network misconfiguration is present in versions prior to 1.0.9.90 of the NETGEAR RAX30 AX2400 series of routers. IPv6 is enabled for the WAN interface by default on these devices. While there are firewall restrictions in place that define access restrictions for IPv4 traffic, these restrictions do not appear to be applied to the WAN interface for IPv6. This allows arbitrary access to any services running on the device that may be inadvertently listening via IPv6, such as the SSH and Telnet servers spawned on ports 22 and 23 by default. This misconfiguration could allow an attacker to interact with services only intended to be accessible by clients on the local network.\n\n- CVE-2022-45414: If a Thunderbird user quoted from an HTML email, for example by replying to the email, and the email contained either a VIDEO tag with the POSTER attribute or an OBJECT tag with a DATA attribute, a network request to the referenced remote URL was performed, regardless of a configuration to block remote content. An image loaded from the POSTER attribute was shown in the composer window. These issues could have given an attacker additional capabilities when targetting releases that did not yet have a fix for CVE-2022-3033 which was reported around three months ago. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.5.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-47717: Last Yard 22.09.8-1 is vulnerable to Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).\n\n- CVE-2022-3057: Inappropriate implementation in iframe Sandbox in Google Chrome prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-31055: kCTF is a Kubernetes-based infrastructure for capture the flag (CTF) competitions. Prior to version 1.6.0, the kctf cluster set-src-ip-ranges was broken and allowed traffic from any IP. The problem has been patched in v1.6.0. As a workaround, those who want to test challenges privately can mark them as `public: false` and use `kctf chal debug port-forward` to connect.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",

The Mint WorkBench installer file allows a low-privileged user to run a \"repair\" operation on the product\n\n- CVE-2022-27659: On F5 BIG-IP 16.1.x versions prior to 16.1.2.2, 15.1.x versions prior to 15.1.5.1, and 14.1.x versions prior to 14.1.4.6, an authenticated attacker can modify or delete Dashboards created by other BIG-IP users in the Traffic Management User Interface (TMUI). Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated\n\n- CVE-2022-46172: authentik is an open-source Identity provider focused on flexibility and versatility. In versions prior to 2022.10.4, and 2022.11.4, any authenticated user can create an arbitrary number of accounts through the default flows. This would circumvent any policy in a situation where it is undesirable for users to create new accounts by themselves. This may also affect other applications as these new basic accounts would exist throughout the SSO infrastructure. By default the newly created accounts cannot be logged into as no password reset exists by default. However password resets are likely to be enabled by most installations. This vulnerability pertains to the user context used in the default-user-settings-flow, /api/v3/flows/instances/default-user-settings-flow/execute/. This issue has been fixed in versions 2022.10.4 and 2022.11.4.\n\n- CVE-2022-2975: A vulnerability related to weak permissions was detected in Avaya Aura Application Enablement Services web application, allowing an administrative user to modify accounts leading to execution of arbitrary code as the root user. This issue affects Application Enablement Services versions 8.0.0.0 through 8.1.3.4 and 10.1.0.0 through 10.1.0.1. Versions prior to 8.0.0.0 are end of manufacturing support and were not evaluated.\n\n- CVE-2022-26676: aEnrich a+HRD has inadequate privilege restrictions, an unauthenticated remote attacker can use the API function to upload and execute malicious scripts to control the system or disrupt service.\n\n- CVE-2022-1901: In affected versions of Octopus Deploy it is possible to unmask sensitive variables by using variable preview.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",
