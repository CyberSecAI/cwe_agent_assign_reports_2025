  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved btrfs fix assertion failure when splitting ordered extent after transaction abort If while we are doing a direct IO write a transaction abort happens, we mark all existing ordered extents with the BTRFS_ORDERED_IOERR flag (done at btrfs_destroy_ordered_extents()), and then after that if we enter btrfs_split_ordered_extent() and the ordered extent has bytes left (meaning we have a bio that doesnt cover the whole ordered extent, see details at btrfs_extract_ordered_extent()), we will fail on the following assertion at btrfs_split_ordered_extent() ASSERT(!(flags & ~BTRFS_ORDERED_TYPE_FLAGS)) because the BTRFS_ORDERED_IOERR flag is set and the definition of BTRFS_ORDERED_TYPE_FLAGS is just the union of all flags that identify the type of write (regular, nocow, prealloc, compressed, direct IO, encoded). Fix this by returning an error from btrfs_extract_ordered_extent() if we find the BTRFS_ORDERED_IOERR flag in the ordered extent. The error will be the error that resulted in the transaction abort or -EIO if no transaction abort happened.
