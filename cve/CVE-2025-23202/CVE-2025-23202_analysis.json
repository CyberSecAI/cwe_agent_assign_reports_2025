  "description": "Bible Module is a tool designed for ROBLOX developers to integrate Bible functionality into their games. The `FetchVerse` and `FetchPassage` functions in the Bible Module are susceptible to injection attacks due to the **absence of input validation**. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to manipulate the API request URLs, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data tampering. This issue has been addressed in version 0.0.3. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

Since the description highlights the **absence of input validation** which can lead to manipulating API request URLs and potentially Server-Side Request Forgery, CWE-20 serves as a suitable starting point. CWE-918 is a potential consequence of the **lack of input validation**, making it a secondary consideration.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    \n    cwe918 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe918 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **absence of input validation** (CWE-20). This allows an attacker to manipulate the API request URLs. This manipulation could potentially lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (CWE-918), resulting in unauthorized access or data tampering.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability based on the provided description. The key phrase \"**absence of input validation**\" strongly suggests CWE-20 as the primary weakness. The description further indicates that this **lack of validation** could lead to manipulation of API request URLs, potentially resulting in unauthorized access or data tampering, hinting at CWE-918.\n\nThe evidence provided directly supports the selection of CWE-20 as the primary CWE, with CWE-918 as a potential consequence. The relationship graph illustrates how the **lack of input validation** (CWE-20) can lead to SSRF (CWE-918).\n\nThe selection of CWE-20 is at the Class level, but it accurately represents the **lack of input validation** as the root cause. While a more specific child CWE might exist, the current evidence does not provide enough detail to pinpoint a more granular weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
