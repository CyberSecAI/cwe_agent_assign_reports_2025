  "query": "Bible Module is a tool designed for ROBLOX developers to integrate Bible functionality into their games. The `FetchVerse` and `FetchPassage` functions in the Bible Module are susceptible to injection attacks due to the absence of input validation. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to manipulate the API request URLs, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data tampering. This issue has been addressed in version 0.0.3. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
