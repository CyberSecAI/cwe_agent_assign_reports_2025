  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Project Worlds Online Lawyer Management System 1.0 and classified as critical. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /save_user_edit_profile.php. The manipulation of the argument first_Name leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-3175 Content\n\nBased on the provided content, this relates to a SQL injection vulnerability. The CVE description is a placeholder, but the content provides significantly more detail than a standard CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is insufficient user input validation of the 'first\\_Name' parameter in the '/save\\_user\\_edit\\_profile.php' file.  The application directly uses this parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering\n*   System control\n*   Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is exploitable via the 'first\\_Name' POST parameter in the '/save\\_user\\_edit\\_profile.php' file.\n*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.\n*   **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.\n*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the least necessary privileges.\n*   **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.\n\n**Payload examples (provided in the content):**\n\nThe content includes several payload examples for boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind SQL injection attacks, demonstrating how the vulnerability can be exploited.  It also includes a sample `sqlmap` command used for testing.",
