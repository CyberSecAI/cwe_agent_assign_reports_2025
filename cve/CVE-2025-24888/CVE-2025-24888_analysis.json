  "description": "The SecureDrop Client is a desktop application for journalists to communicate with sources and work with submissions on the SecureDrop Workstation. Prior to version 0.14.1, a malicious SecureDrop Server could obtain code execution on the SecureDrop Client virtual machine (`sd-app`). SecureDrop Server itself has multiple layers of built-in hardening, and is a dedicated physical machine exposed on the internet only via Tor hidden services for the Source and Journalist interfaces, and optionally via remote SSH access over another Tor hidden service. A newsrooms SecureDrop Workstation communicates only with its own dedicated SecureDrop Server. The SecureDrop Client runs in a dedicated Qubes virtual machine, named `sd-app`, as part of the SecureDrop Workstation. The private OpenPGP key used to decrypt submissions and replies is stored in a separate virtual machine and never accessed directly. The vulnerability lies in the code responsible for downloading replies. The filename of the reply is obtained from the `Content-Disposition` HTTP header and used to write the encrypted reply on disk. Note that filenames are generated and sanitized server-side, and files are downloaded in an encrypted format, so a remote attacker who has not achieved server compromise, such as one posing as a source, could not craft the HTTP response necessary for this attack. While the filename is later checked to guard against **path traversal** before being moved into the Clients data storage directory, the file has already been written to a potentially arbitrary location. In this case, `safe_move()` would detect the **path traversal** and fail, leaving the original downloaded file in the attacker-chosen directory. Code execution can be gained by writing an autostart file in `/home/user/.config/autostart/`. Version 0.14.1 fixes the issue. As of time of publication, there is no known evidence of exploitation in the wild. This attack requires a previously compromised SecureDrop Server.",

The SecureDrop server is compromised.\n2.  The server crafts a malicious HTTP response with a `Content-Disposition` header containing a filename with **path traversal** sequences.\n3.  The SecureDrop Client downloads the file to an arbitrary location on disk due to **insufficient path traversal** checks before the file write.\n4.  The `safe_move()` function detects the **path traversal** during the move operation, but the file is already written.\n5.  Attacker gains code execution by writing an autostart file.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is a **path traversal** issue (CWE-23) in the SecureDrop Client, which allows a compromised SecureDrop server to write files to arbitrary locations due to **insufficient sanitization** of the filename obtained from the `Content-Disposition` header. Although there is a later check to guard against path traversal, the file has already been written. This can lead to code execution by writing an autostart file to `/home/user/.config/autostart/`.\n\nThe primary weakness is CWE-23 (Relative Path Traversal), as the vulnerability's core lies in the application's **failure to properly neutralize path traversal** sequences, enabling the writing of files to unintended locations. CWE-23 is a base level CWE which is at the preferred abstraction level.\n\nCWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) is a secondary consideration because the successful **path traversal** allows writing an autostart file (a dangerous type) to an arbitrary location, leading to code execution. While the description mentions that the filenames are generated and sanitized server-side, the vulnerability arises because this sanitization is **insufficient**.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-22: While a parent of CWE-23, it's less specific and the evidence supports the relative traversal.\n*   CWE-201 and CWE-212: These relate to sensitive information, which is not the primary concern here. The downloaded files are encrypted, and the issue is about the file's location, not its content.\n*   CWE-918: SSRF is not applicable as the client is not making requests based on server-provided URLs.\n*   CWE-295 and CWE-345: Certificate validation and data authenticity are not the focus here. The server is assumed to be compromised.\n*   CWE-923 and CWE-1275: Related to communication channel restrictions and cookies respectively, which are not applicable.\n*   CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions. While the file is written before the `safe_move` function, this CWE is not appropriate because the issue is about **path traversal**, not insecure permissions.\n*   CWE-346: Origin Validation Error is too high level.\n*   CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory, is about sensitive information, not the file location.\n*   CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output is about structured messages, which is not applicable.\n\n```\n  ________  _________  ______   _______   ________ _________\n (_______)(  _______)(  __  \\ (  ____ ) (  ____  )\\__   __/\n  _______ | (_______ | (  \\  )| (____ ) | (____ ) |   ) (\n (_______)|         |(  __  ) |  ____ ) |  ____  ) |   | |\n  _______ | (_______ | (  \\  )| (____ ) | (____ ) |   ) (\n (_______)(_________) (______/ (_______) (_______) |   ) (\n```\n\n# Summary\n| CWE ID  | CWE Name                                                                                    | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |\n| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------- | :---------------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ |\n| CWE-23  | Relative Path Traversal                                                                 | 1          | Base                    | Primary                         | Allowed                       |\n| CWE-434 | Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type                                         | 0.7        | Base                    | Secondary                       | Allowed                       |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-23, which describes the **improper neutralization of special elements within a pathname** that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location outside of the restricted directory.
