- **product:** code-projects Job Recruitment
- **version:** 1
- **component:** /_parse/_all_edits.php add_req function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the provided document:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12978 (based on the file name `sql7.md`)

**Vulnerability Description:**
A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the "job-recruitment-in-php" application, specifically within the `add_req` action. The vulnerability is located in the `jid` parameter.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the direct concatenation of the `jid` parameter value into an SQL query without any sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `jid` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection, enabling an attacker to manipulate database queries.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (`jid` parameter), leading to the vulnerability.
- **Direct Query Construction:** Building SQL queries by directly concatenating user-provided strings is a critical coding error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** A successful SQL injection attack can allow an attacker to extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, personal information, and other confidential data.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete database records, leading to data integrity issues and service disruptions.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** In some cases, a SQL injection vulnerability can be leveraged to gain deeper access to the underlying server by using database features (such as `xp_cmdshell` if available), though this is not directly demonstrated in the provided description.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request targeting the `_parse/_all_edits.php` file with a crafted `jid` parameter.
- **`jid` Parameter:** The `jid` parameter is the vulnerable input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft a malicious payload.
- **No Authentication Required (Implied):** The vulnerability appears to be exploitable without prior authentication to the application.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable Code:** When the `add_req` action is triggered, the application retrieves the `jid` parameter via `$_POST['jid']`, directly concatenates it into an SQL query, and executes that query.
- **Example SQL Injection (from POC):** The provided Proof-of-Concept (POC) demonstrates the injection using a payload of `jid=1*&degree=2&skillset1=1&action=add_req`. The `1*` injection is intended to cause an error (or potentially extract information) depending on the application's query logic.
- **Exploitation:** By modifying the `jid` parameter, the attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database and potentially retrieve information, manipulate data, or other malicious actions.
- **Result screenshots:** The screenshots in the document show the use of SQL injection to get tables and other database information.

**Additional Notes:**
- The application is referred to as "job-recruitment-in-php".
- The provided content also has information about the development team who discovered the issue.
- The provided links point to `code-projects.org` which appears to be the website hosting the application, which indicates that the application is available for download.

This detailed breakdown provides a clear understanding of the SQL injection vulnerability, how it can be exploited, and what the potential impacts are.
