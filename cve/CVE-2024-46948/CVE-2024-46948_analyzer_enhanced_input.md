## Vulnerability Description
Northern.tech Mender before 3.6.5 and 3.7.x before 3.7.5 has Incorrect Access Control.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **incorrect access control**
- **product:** Northern.tech Mender
- **version:** before 3.6.5, 3.7.x before 3.7.5

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `/devauth/devices` API endpoint in Mender did not properly enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and device group filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing RBAC Enforcement:** The API failed to respect the configured device group permissions associated with user roles. This allowed users to potentially access information about devices that they should not have had access to, based on their assigned role and device groups.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  The vulnerability resulted in the disclosure of device information to unauthorized users within the same organization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Users with limited access to specific device groups could see read-only information for *all* devices within the organization.
*   **Privacy Concerns:** Exposure of device status, MAC addresses, authentication sets with public keys, and timestamps associated with all devices in the organization.
*   **Limited Severity:** The impact is limited due to:
    *   Read-only access only.
    *   Only exposed information to authenticated users within the organization.
    *   Limited information disclosed: basic status, MAC address, public keys, timestamps.
    *   No sensitive information like passwords, private keys, or detailed inventory were exposed.
    *   Only affects customers using device groups to limit access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Endpoint:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a GET request to the `/api/management/v2/devauth/devices` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user within the organization using the Mender platform.
*   **Limited Role:** The user must have a role that limits their access to specific device groups.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by disabling the specific API endpoint (`/api/management/v2/devauth/devices`) for users with limited access.
*   The API can still be used to retrieve information about individual devices by providing the device ID as a query parameter. This functionality respects RBAC and device groups.
*   The fix has been deployed for hosted Mender. On-premise users must upgrade to versions 3.6.5, 3.7.5, or later.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| No identity check (no login)                               | CWE-306        |
| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
