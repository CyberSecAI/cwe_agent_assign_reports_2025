## Vulnerability Description
Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor, Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information vulnerability in Maven Archetype Plugin. This issue affects Maven Archetype Plugin from 3.2.1 before 3.3.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.3.0, which fixes the issue. Archetype integration testing creates a file called ./target/classes/archetype-it/archetype-settings.xml This file contains all the content from the users ~/.m2/settings.xml file, which often contains information they do not want to publish. We expect that on many developer machines, this also contains credentials. When the user runs mvn verify again (without a mvn clean), this file becomes part of the final artifact. If a developer were to publish this into Maven Central or any other remote repository (whether as a release or a snapshot) their credentials would be published without them knowing.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insecure storage of sensitive information**
- **impact:** Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
- **attacker:** unauthorized actor
- **product:** Maven Archetype Plugin
- **version:** 3.2.1 before 3.3.0
- **component:** Archetype integration testing

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Maven Archetype Plugin, during integration testing, creates a file `archetype-settings.xml` within the `./target/classes/archetype-it/` directory.
*   This file inadvertently copies the content of the user's `~/.m2/settings.xml` file.
*   The `~/.m2/settings.xml` file often contains sensitive information, including credentials.
*   When `mvn verify` is run again without a `mvn clean`, this file is packaged into the final artifact.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The plugin inadvertently includes user's local settings (potentially containing credentials) into the artifact being built.
*   **Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information**: Local settings are stored in a location that might be unintentionally included in a published artifact.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Exposure:** If a developer publishes the artifact containing the `archetype-settings.xml` to a public or shared repository (like Maven Central), their credentials could be exposed to unauthorized actors.
*   **Compromise of Accounts:** Exposed credentials could be used to gain unauthorized access to the user's accounts or systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Publishing Artifact with Sensitive Data:** A developer who runs `mvn verify` without a `mvn clean` and then publishes the artifact to a remote repository.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to access the published artifact, which can be in a public repository or a shared repository that they have access to.
* No other specific capabilities are needed.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability exists in versions 3.2.1 and prior.
*   The fix is in version 3.3.0.
*   The issue is tracked as ARCHETYPE-657 in Apache Jira.
