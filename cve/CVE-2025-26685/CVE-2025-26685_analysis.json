CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing is a peer of CWE-287. Because the description says \"**Improper authentication**\" the more general CWE-287 is selected as the Primary. CWE-290 is added as a secondary CWE because the impact is Spoofing.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe290[\"CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe290 -->|PEEROF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe290 secondary\n    \n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Authentication** (CWE-287), which leads to the impact of allowing an unauthorized attacker to perform spoofing (CWE-290) over an adjacent network.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis identified \"**Improper authentication**\" as the root cause, aligning with CWE-287. The impact, \"spoofing,\" suggested CWE-290. The guidance recommends CWE-306 for \"Missing Authentication,\" but the description specifies \"Improper,\" indicating a flawed authentication process rather than a complete absence of authentication. The final decision prioritizes CWE-287 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of **improper authentication**, supplemented by CWE-290 to capture the specific impact of spoofing.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity

CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication algorithm is sound, but the implemented mechanism can be bypassed as the result of a separate weakness that is primary to the authentication error.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\n**Abstraction Level**:

attacks.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n-

Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping

mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names.
