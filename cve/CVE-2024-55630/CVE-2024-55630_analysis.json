  "description": "Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. Joplins HTML sanitizer allows the `name` attribute to be specified. If `name` is set to the same value as an existing `document` property (e.g. `querySelector`), that property is replaced with the element. This vulnerabilitys only known impact is denial of service. The note viewer fails to refresh until closed and re-opened with a different note. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.8 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

Verification:**\n\nBoth provided content snippets relate to CVE-2024-55630, as explicitly stated in the first snippet and confirmed by the commit message in the second.\n\n**2. Extracted Information:**\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   Joplin's HTML sanitizer allows the `name` attribute to be specified in HTML tags.\n*   Setting the `name` attribute to the same value as an existing `document` property (e.g., `querySelector`, `getElementById`) overwrites that property with the element. This is known as DOM clobbering.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   DOM Clobbering\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Denial of Service (DoS): The note viewer fails to refresh until closed and reopened with a different note.  Most script interactions with the Markdown viewer fail with errors.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Creating a note with malicious content containing an `<img>` tag with a `name` attribute set to a DOM property (e.g., `<img name=getElementById src=x/>`).\n*   Attempting to switch notes after creating the malicious note.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to create a note within the Joplin application.\n*   No special privileges are required.\n*   User interaction is required (the user must attempt to switch notes).\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The commit `e70efcb` removes the `name` attribute when rendering HTML to prevent the DOM clobbering vulnerability. Specifically, the code in `packages/renderer/htmlUtils.ts` now deletes the `name` attribute if it exists in the attributes being processed.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **Affected versions:** <= 3.2.3\n*   **CVSS Score:** 3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L (Overall score: /10)\n*   **PoC:** The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability.\n*   **Credits:** The vulnerability was reported by @personalizedrefrigerator.\n*   The commit message references issue #11591, which likely contains further details about the fix.\n*   The test case `sanitize_22.md` and `sanitize_22.html` demonstrate the vulnerability and the expected sanitization.",

The product allows modification of object prototype attributes, which is then used to cause a denial of service. The evidence supporting this includes:\n\n*   \"Joplin's HTML sanitizer allows the `name` attribute to be specified.\"\n*   \"If `name` is set to the same value as an existing `document` property (e.g. `querySelector`), that property is replaced with the element.\"\n*   \"This vulnerabilitys only known impact is denial of service.\"\n\nThe secondary weakness is the **uncontrolled resource consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')** (CWE-400).
