# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-52510

## Vulnerability Description
The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud Server with your computer. The Desktop client did not stop with an error but allowed **by-passing the signature validation**, if a manipulated server sends an empty initial signature. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Desktop client is upgraded to 3.14.2 or later.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **by-passing the signature validation**
- **vector:** manipulated server sends an empty initial signature
- **product:** Nextcloud Desktop Client
- **version:** before 3.14.2

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-52510:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Nextcloud desktop client did not properly handle an empty initial end-to-end encryption signature from the server, allowing it to bypass signature validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper Input Validation: The client failed to check if the received signature was empty before attempting to process it.
- Logic Error: The client proceeded with metadata setup even with an empty signature, potentially leading to data corruption or unauthorized access to encrypted data.
- Vulnerability to man-in-the-middle (MITM): The client did not enforce signature validation for the encrypted data sent by the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Bypassing signature validation for end-to-end encrypted data.
- Potential for the attacker to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted data by sending modified encrypted data with an empty signature.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack, where a malicious server can send an empty initial end-to-end encryption signature to the Nextcloud desktop client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the server response to the Nextcloud desktop client, which could involve a compromised server or a man-in-the-middle attack.
- The attacker needs to have high privileges on the server to control the data and signatures sent to the client.
- The user is required to interact with the client for the exploitation to take place.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in Nextcloud Desktop client version 3.14.2.
- The fix includes checks for empty signatures in `discoveryphase.cpp` and `foldermetadata.cpp`. If the signature is empty, the client reports an error and does not proceed with the setup.
- A new test case (`testFolderMetadataWithEmptySignatureDecryptFails`) was added to ensure the fix is effective.
- The vulnerability is classified as having a "Moderate" severity.
