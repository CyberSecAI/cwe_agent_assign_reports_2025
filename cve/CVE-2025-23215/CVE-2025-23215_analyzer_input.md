# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-23215

## Vulnerability Description
PMD is an extensible multilanguage static code analyzer. The passphrase for the PMD and PMD Designer release signing keys are included in jar published to Maven Central. The private key itself is not known to have been compromised itself, but given its passphrase is, it must also be considered potentially compromised. As a mitigation, both compromised keys have been revoked so that no future use of the keys are possible. Note, that the published artifacts in Maven Central under the group id net.sourceforge.pmd are not compromised and the signatures are valid.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **weak passphrase**
- **impact:** signature verification with potentially compromised keys
- **product:** PMD and PMD Designer

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```text
EXTRACT
- Root cause of vulnerability: The passphrase for a GPG key was included in a JAR file published to Maven Central.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: CWE-200, CWE-312, CWE-540.
- Impact of exploitation:  The passphrase of two keys were compromised, allowing potential attackers to sign artifacts and potentially compromise the integrity of the software.  The following keys were compromised:
  - `94A5 2756 9CAF 7A47 AFCA BDE4 86D3 7ECA 8C2E 4C5B`: PMD Designer (Release Signing Key)
  - `EBB2 41A5 45CB 17C8 7FAC B2EB D0BF 1D73 7C9A 1C22`: PMD Release Signing Key
- Mitigation or fix:
  - Revoked the compromised keys.
  - Reworked the build script to prevent inclusion of sensitive information.
  - A new release signing key was implemented: `2EFA 55D0 785C 31F9 56F2 F87E A0B5 CA1A 4E08 6838`
