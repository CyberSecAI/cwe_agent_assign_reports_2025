# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-9465

## Vulnerability Description
An **SQL injection** vulnerability in Palo Alto Networks Expedition allows an unauthenticated attacker to reveal Expedition database contents, such as password hashes, usernames, device configurations, and device API keys. With this, attackers can also create and read arbitrary files on the Expedition system.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **SQL injection**
- **impact:** reveal database contents, create and read arbitrary files
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attacker
- **product:** Palo Alto Networks Expedition

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9465:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `/var/www/html/bin/configurations/parsers/Checkpoint/CHECKPOINT.php` file. Specifically, the `routeName` and `id` parameters, when the `action` parameter is set to `import`, are directly used within a SQL query without any sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Unauthenticated SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it constructs SQL queries using user-controlled input without sanitization and it is accessible without authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, including password hashes, usernames, device configurations, and device API keys.
- **Arbitrary File Access:** Attackers can create and read arbitrary files on the Expedition system.

**Attack vectors:**

- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via HTTP requests to `/var/www/html/bin/configurations/parsers/Checkpoint/CHECKPOINT.php`.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the vulnerable Expedition server.
- **No Privileges:** No user privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is present in the `CHECKPOINT.php` file, where SQL queries are constructed with unsanitized user input.
- Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the `routeName` parameter.
- The blog post details how to first create the necessary table using the `action=get` parameter and then trigger the SQL injection using `action=import`.
- The vulnerability can be exploited to perform blind SQL injection using time-based payloads to extract data using tools like SQLMap.
- The Palo Alto advisory confirms that CVE-2024-9465 is an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability.
- There is evidence of active exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild.
