This CWE describes the **lack of** limits or throttling on resource allocation which can lead to denial of service. |\n| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.60 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate. Although resource consumption is relevant, the **lack of** limits is the root cause. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-770, which is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-400. This indicates a hierarchical relationship where the more specific weakness (CWE-770) contributes to the broader issue of uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400). There is a CANFOLLOW relationship from CWE-770 to CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), suggesting that improper input validation could lead to resource allocation issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe770 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n    class cwe20 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of** resource limits or throttling (CWE-770), which leads to uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400), ultimately resulting in a denial-of-service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **allocation of resources without limits or throttling (CWE-770)**, which directly leads to the denial-of-service. This is based on the vulnerability description stating that the CIP/Modbus communication may be disrupted. While other CWEs like CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) are related, CWE-770 more accurately reflects the root cause.
