The vulnerability involves a **hardcoded password**, which directly matches the description of CWE-259. |\n| CWE-798 | Use of Hard-coded Credentials | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. CWE-798 is a broader category that includes hardcoded passwords and cryptographic keys. |\n| CWE-1393 | Use of Default Password | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. Although the description mentions a hardcoded password, it could also be considered a default password. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-259 (**Use of Hard-coded Password**), which is a Variant of the Base CWE-798 (**Use of Hard-coded Credentials**). This indicates a parent-child relationship where CWE-259 is a more specific case of CWE-798. CWE-1393 (**Use of Default Password**) is also related as hardcoded passwords might be considered default passwords.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe1393[\"CWE-1393: Use of Default Password\"]\n\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe1393 -->|PEEROF| cwe259\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe259 primary\n    class cwe798,cwe1393 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **hardcoded password** (CWE-259). This allows an attacker to log in as root, leading to complete system compromise. The root cause is the hardcoded password, and the impact is unauthorized root access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the retriever results. The description explicitly states a \"**hardcoded password**\" vulnerability, making CWE-259 the most appropriate primary CWE. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" does not disclose any weaknesses, attack vectors, or required capabilities. The selection of CWE-259 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the **rootcause** of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe
