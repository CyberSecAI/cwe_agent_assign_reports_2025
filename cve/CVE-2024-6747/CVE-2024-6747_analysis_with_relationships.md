# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2024-6747

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-201, which is a Base level CWE, making it more specific than its parent, CWE-200. CWE-201 focuses on the actual transmission of sensitive data, while CWE-200 is a more general class of exposure. The relationships show that CWE-201 can also be CWE-202 (Exposure of Data Element) or CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information), but those are not as direct based on the vulnerability description.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **mknotifyd service generating a result message** containing sensitive information, which is then sent to a remote site. A malicious actor intercepts this message, leading to the exposure of secrets.
  - **Root Cause:** **mknotifyd service generating result message with secrets**
  - **Weakness:** Information Leak through transmitted data
  - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information

## Summary of Analysis
The primary classification is CWE-201 because the vulnerability description explicitly states that the mknotifyd service generates a "result message" containing details which inadvertently include secrets and sends this data to a remote site. The key phrase "Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data" aligns directly with the vulnerability where sensitive data (secrets) is included in the transmitted result message.

CWE-200 was considered because it is a broader category for exposure of sensitive information. However, CWE-201 is more specific since it directly addresses the scenario where sensitive information is inserted into data that is then transmitted. The evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary supports the transmission aspect, stating that the "result message" is sent, making CWE-201 a better fit.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].

## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a
