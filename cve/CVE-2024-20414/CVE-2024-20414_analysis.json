  "description": "A vulnerability in the web UI feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system through the web UI. This vulnerability is due to **incorrectly accepting configuration changes through the HTTP GET method**. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a currently authenticated administrator to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to change the configuration of the affected device.",

The web UI does not properly validate the origin of configuration change requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests.\n- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow the attacker to change the configuration of the affected device.\n- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this by persuading a currently authenticated administrator to follow a crafted link. The attacker crafts a malicious link that, when clicked by an authenticated user, sends a forged HTTP GET request to the device to modify its configuration.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link and trick an authenticated administrator into clicking it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the device itself. The attacker must be able to send the crafted link to the administrator via means such as email, chat, or embedding it in a malicious webpage. The user needs to have an active session with the web UI.",

CWE-807 is a related weakness where the security decision relies on untrusted inputs, which aligns with the vulnerability's root cause of **incorrectly accepting configuration changes through the HTTP GET method**. Although CWE-807 could be a root cause, CWE-352 is the more direct Compound weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe807[\"CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\"]\n\n    cwe352 -- Requires --> cwe807\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe807 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect acceptance of configuration changes via HTTP GET**, leading to a CSRF vulnerability. An attacker crafts a malicious link, an authenticated user clicks the link, and the device configuration is changed without proper validation.\n\nRoot Cause: **Incorrectly accepting configuration changes through the HTTP GET method**.\nWeakness: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CWE-352).\nImpact: Configuration change of the affected device.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is strongly supported by the vulnerability description, which explicitly states that the vulnerability allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack. The root cause is **incorrectly accepting configuration changes through the HTTP GET method**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-352 is based on its direct relevance to the vulnerability description. CWE-807 is a potential contributing factor, as the device relies on the HTTP method (GET) as an input for security decisions, but it's more appropriately related to the root cause.\n\nThe retriever results also suggest CWE-352 as a relevant candidate. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) was considered but deemed too general. CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) and CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')) were also considered but discarded because they are not directly related to the CSRF vulnerability.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference links confirms the CSRF nature of the vulnerability and the **incorrect HTTP GET method handling**, leading to the selection of CWE-352 as the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
