  "reference_content": "## CVE-2025-29154 Analysis\n\nThe provided content is **RELATED** to CVE-2025-29154. It details a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a client-side HTML injection vulnerability in the galera-app version 4.58.0.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe root cause is a client-side HTML injection vulnerability, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary HTML into various input fields of the application.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n*   Client-side HTML injection.\n*   Lack of proper input sanitization/output encoding.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nThe impact is limited to client-side manipulation. An attacker can inject HTML to potentially:\n*   Deface the application's appearance.\n*   Phish for user credentials (though the CVSS string indicates low impact).\n*   Execute malicious JavaScript (potentially, depending on the context and browser security).\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe vulnerability exists in multiple input fields across various components of the application, including:\n*   Strategic Planning Perspective Registration (description)\n*   Training Request (course and competency)\n*   Perspective Editing (description)\n*   Education Registration (description)\n*   Hierarchical Level Registration (description)\n*   Decision Level Registration (description)\n*   Perspective Registration (description)\n*   Company Group Registration (description)\n*   Company Registration (description)\n*   News Registration (title)\n*   Employee Editing (observation)\n*   Goal Team Registration (description)\n*   Learning Resource Type Registration (description)\n*   Learning Resource Family Registration (description)\n*   Learning Resource Supplier Registration (description, observation, and email)\n*   Cycle Maintenance (cycle description)\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n*   Low privilege: The CVSS vector string (PR:L) indicates that the attacker needs low privileges to exploit the vulnerability.\n*   User interaction: The CVSS vector string (UI:R) indicates that user interaction is required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\nThe document does not provide specific mitigation steps, but the vulnerability can be mitigated by:\n*   Implementing proper input validation and sanitization on the server-side.\n*   Encoding output to prevent the execution of injected HTML.\n*   Using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.\n\n**CVSS Vector String:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N\n\n**Additional Details:**\nThe content provides more detail than the official CVE description would likely contain, specifically listing the affected components and input fields, as well as demonstrating the vulnerability with screenshots. The payloads used are simple HTML tags like `<h1>`, `<a href>`, and `<marquee>`.",

Matches the **HTML injection vulnerability** root cause and impact. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship considered was the parent-child relationship. CWE-79 is a Base level CWE. The retriever results provided some Variant level CWEs that are children of CWE-79, such as CWE-82, but the description does not provide enough information to support a more specific CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe82[\"CWE-82: Improper Neutralization of Script in Attributes of IMG Tags in a Web Page\"]\n    \n    cwe82 -->|CHILDOF| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe82 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization of input**, leading to the impact of being able to **execute arbitrary code** through **HTML injection**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which includes the vulnerability description and the CVE reference content summary. The vulnerability is described as an **HTML injection vulnerability**, which directly corresponds to CWE-79. The CVE reference confirms the root cause as \"client-side HTML injection\" and \"lack of proper input sanitization/output encoding\". The impact includes \"execute arbitrary code,\" which is a typical consequence of successful XSS attacks.\n\nCWE-79 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause and the demonstrated impact. The retriever results support this choice, with CWE-79 being the top-ranked CWE. Other CWEs considered, such as CWE-82, were not specific enough, as the vulnerability isn't limited to IMG tags. CWE-74 was discarded as it is too high-level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because it is more specific to HTML tags, but the description does not limit the injection to HTML tags.*\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because it is too high level.*\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
