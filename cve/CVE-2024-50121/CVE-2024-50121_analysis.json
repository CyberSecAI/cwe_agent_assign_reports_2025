  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved nfsd cancel nfsd_shrinker_work using sync mode in nfs4_state_shutdown_net In the normal case, when we excute `echo 0 > /proc/fs/nfsd/threads`, the function `nfs4_state_destroy_net` in `nfs4_state_shutdown_net` will release all resources related to the hashed `nfs4_client`. If the `nfsd_client_shrinker` is running concurrently, the `expire_client` function will first unhash this client and then destroy it. This can lead to the following warning.

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability arises from a race condition between the `nfsd_client_shrinker` and the `nfs4_state_shutdown_net` functions during the shutdown of the NFS server. Specifically, when the command `echo 0 > /proc/fs/nfsd/threads` is executed, it triggers the `nfs4_state_destroy_net` function within `nfs4_state_shutdown_net` to release resources associated with hashed `nfs4_client` structures. Simultaneously, the `nfsd_client_shrinker` might be running, and its `expire_client` function could unhash and attempt to destroy the same client.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Race condition:**  A race exists between the `nfsd_client_shrinker` and `nfs4_state_shutdown_net` during resource cleanup.\n*   **Use-after-free:** If the shrinker unhashes a client and the shutdown process doesn't wait for the shrinker to complete, a use-after-free can occur when the shutdown process attempts to destroy resources associated with the client that the shrinker has already started to free.\n*   **Improper synchronization:** The original code used `cancel_work` which does not guarantee that the work item is completed before proceeding. This led to the shutdown process continuing before the shrinker had finished, causing the race condition and use-after-free scenarios.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Kernel Warning/Bug:** The primary impact is a kernel warning or BUG, which can indicate unstable system behavior.\n*   **Use-after-free errors:** The race condition can result in use-after-free errors, potentially leading to system crashes or other unpredictable behavior.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Triggering NFS server shutdown:** The vulnerability is triggered by the shutdown of the NFS server, which can be done using the command `echo 0 > /proc/fs/nfsd/threads`.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **Root or administrative privileges:** The attacker needs the ability to write to `/proc/fs/nfsd/threads` which requires root or administrative privileges on the system.\n*   **Access to the NFS server:** The attacker must have access to a machine that's running an NFS server.\n\n**Technical details:**\n\nThe core of the issue lies in the non-synchronous nature of `cancel_work()`. When `cancel_work` is used, it only attempts to remove the work item from the queue. It does not wait for the work item (in this case, `nfsd_shrinker_work`) to finish processing before continuing. This allows `nfs4_state_shutdown_net` to proceed with the shutdown process and the destruction of resources related to the nfs4 client, potentially before the shrinker has finished with the same resource leading to a race condition and a use-after-free. The fix introduces `cancel_work_sync()`, which waits for the work item to complete before continuing, resolving the race condition and use-after-free issue.\n\nThe provided content also includes detailed stack traces from the kernel bugs, illustrating the specific functions that are being called when the issue occurs.\n\nThe fix, as shown in the diff, replaces `cancel_work` with `cancel_work_sync` in `nfs4_state_shutdown_net`. This ensures that the `nfsd_shrinker_work` is fully completed before the shutdown process continues, thus resolving the identified race condition and preventing use-after-free errors.",
