  "description": "OpenCTI is an open source platform for managing cyber threat intelligence knowledge and observables. Prior to version 6.5.2, any user with the capability manage customizations can edit webhook that will execute javascript code. This can be abused to cause a denial of service attack by ****prototype pollution****, making the node js server running the OpenCTI frontend become unavailable. Version 6.5.2 fixes the issue.",

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the content:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the ability of users with the `manage customizations` capability to edit webhooks and execute JavaScript code within them.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Prototype pollution in the JavaScript execution within webhooks.\n*   Improper input validation/sanitization of JavaScript code in webhooks.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploitation leads to a denial of service by crashing the Node.js server running the OpenCTI frontend.\n*   Related to, and a complementary fix for, a more severe Remote Code Execution vulnerability (GHSA-mf88-g2wq-p7qm).\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Network-based: An attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.\n*   Requires a user account with the `manage customizations` capability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs a user account with the `manage customizations` capability.\n*   Knowledge of JavaScript and prototype pollution techniques.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade to version 6.5.2 or later.\n*   The fix addresses the ability to cause a denial of service through prototype pollution.\n\n**CVSS v3 Metrics:**\n\n*   **Attack Vector:** Network (N)\n*   **Attack Complexity:** Low (L)\n*   **Privileges Required:** High (H)\n*   **User Interaction:** None (N)\n*   **Scope:** Changed (C)\n*   **Confidentiality:** None (N)\n*   **Integrity:** Low (L)\n*   **Availability:** High (H)\n*   **Overall Score:** 7.6 (High)\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\nThe content clarifies that this vulnerability is related to a previous, more critical vulnerability (GHSA-mf88-g2wq-p7qm) involving remote code execution and sensitive secrets exposure. This vulnerability is a follow-up security fix addressing a related issue.",

Although there are no explicit parent-child relationships outlined in the provided relationships section, its impact can lead to resource consumption issues, potentially represented by CWE-400. Thus, they are related by impact.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1321[\"CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe1321 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1321 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a user having the capability to manage customizations and edit webhooks. This allows the user to inject JavaScript code that performs **prototype pollution**. The **prototype pollution** then leads to a denial of service attack.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-1321 Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\n  - **Impact:** CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, Denial of Service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description which explicitly mentions **prototype pollution** as the root cause of a denial of service. CWE-1321 directly maps to **prototype pollution**, making it the primary CWE.\n\nThe relationships section helped identify potential impacts of **prototype pollution**, leading to the inclusion of CWE-400 as a secondary CWE due to the described denial of service impact.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1321 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the root cause.
