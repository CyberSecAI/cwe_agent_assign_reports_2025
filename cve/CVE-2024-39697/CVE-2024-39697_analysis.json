  "description": "phonenumber is a library for parsing, formatting and validating international phone numbers. Since 0.3.4, the phonenumber parsing code may panic due to a **panic-guarded out-of-bounds access** on the phonenumber string. In a typical deployment of rust-phonenumber, this may get triggered by feeding a maliciously crafted phonenumber, e.g. over the network, specifically strings of the form `+dwPAAphone-context=AA`, where the number part potentially parses as a number larger than 2^56. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.3.6.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-39697:\n\n**1. Verification:**\nThe content clearly relates to CVE-2024-39697. The provided GitHub security advisory (GHSA-mjw4-jj88-v687) explicitly states that it corresponds to CVE-2024-39697.\n\n**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n   - The vulnerability stems from an `assert!` statement within the `NationalNumber::new` function. This assertion checked if the provided numerical value was less than 2^56 (56 bits).\n   - The `NationalNumber` struct was modified to store the national number and leading zeros in a single `u64` field, where the leading zeros are stored in the higher bits, and the number itself in the lower bits. This optimization required the assertion.\n   - The `assert!` caused the program to panic when processing a crafted phone number where the numerical part, after parsing, exceeded the 56-bit limit.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n   - **Unchecked Input:** The `NationalNumber::new` function, while intended for internal use with trusted input, was indirectly reachable by parsing untrusted strings, leading to a panic.\n   - **Use of `assert!`:** The usage of `assert!` for input validation resulted in a denial-of-service vulnerability. Assertions are intended to catch internal programming errors and should not be used for handling invalid user input, as they cause the program to panic.\n   - **Implicit Trust:**  The code implicitly trusted the input to `NationalNumber::new`, assuming it would always be a valid value.\n\n**4. Impact of Exploitation:**\n   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** A maliciously crafted phone number string could cause a program using the library to crash.\n   - The vulnerability could be triggered remotely by an attacker if the crafted phone number was processed over a network.\n\n**5. Attack Vectors:**\n   - **Network:** The vulnerability is triggered by passing a crafted string to the parsing function, which then converts this string into a large number that goes past the assertion in the `NationalNumber::new` function.\n   - **String Parsing:** The attack vector involves exploiting the string parsing logic of the library to create phone numbers with national numbers that, when converted to a numeric value, exceed the 56-bit limit.\n\n**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n   - **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker must be able to provide an arbitrary phone number string to be parsed by the vulnerable library.\n   - **No Special Privileges:** The attack can be performed without requiring any specific privileges or user interaction.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n- The vulnerability was introduced in version 0.3.4 of the library with the change to store national numbers in 64 bits.\n- The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.3.6 by replacing the `assert!` with an explicit error return.\n- Property-based testing was used to discover the problematic code path that triggered the panic.\n- A crafted example of a malicious string is `+dwPAA;phone-context=AA`, which when parsed resulted in a number greater than 56 bits, triggering the assertion.\n- The commit `f69abee` introduced the vulnerable code.\n- The commit `b792151` fixed the vulnerability.\n- The fix involved replacing the `assert!` with a `Result` and returning an error when the national number is too long.\n- The vulnerable code is in `src/national_number.rs` and the fix is also in the same file.",

While the code contains an assertion, the assertion is triggered by malformed input, which points to a failure in validating the input before processing it.\nCWE-20 and CWE-617 have a relationship where improper input validation (CWE-20) can lead to unexpected states that trigger assertions (CWE-617).\nCWE-125 was considered due to the out-of-bounds aspect mentioned in the vulnerability description, but it was ultimately deemed less relevant than CWE-617 as the out-of-bounds access is guarded by the assertion.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe617[\"CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    \n    cwe617 -->|RELATED_TO| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe617 primary\n    class cwe20,cwe125 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events can be described as follows:\n1.  **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The application receives a maliciously crafted phone number string without proper validation.\n2.  **Reachable Assertion (CWE-617):** The crafted input leads to an unexpected state that triggers an assertion, causing a denial-of-service.\nThe chain highlights how the lack of proper input handling directly leads to the assertion being triggered.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary focus is on the **panic-guarded out-of-bounds access**, which is triggered by a maliciously crafted phone number. The key here is that the **out-of-bounds access** is \"panic-guarded\", meaning that an assertion is triggered. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states that the **root cause** is that the `assert!` caused the program to panic when processing a crafted phone number where the numerical part, after parsing, exceeded the 56-bit limit. The summary further states that the usage of `assert!` for input validation resulted in a denial-of-service vulnerability because assertions are intended to catch internal programming errors and should not be used for handling invalid user input, as they cause the program to panic. Given this analysis, CWE-617 (Reachable Assertion) is the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a secondary CWE, because the root cause of the vulnerability involves a failure to validate the input, which allows the crafted input to reach the assertion.\n\nCWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) was considered, but the **panic-guarded** nature of the vulnerability makes CWE-617 more appropriate, as the primary concern is the assertion being triggered, rather than an out-of-bounds read occurring directly.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they accurately capture the root cause and contributing factors of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values.
