# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-12778
## Query
A vulnerability in aimhubio/aim version 3.25.0 allows for a denial of service (DoS) attack. The issue arises when a large number of tracked metrics are retrieved simultaneously from the Aim web API, causing the web server to become unresponsive. The root cause is the lack of a limit on the number of metrics that can be requested per call, combined with the servers single-threaded nature, leading to excessive resource consumption and blocking of the server.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'lack of limit on the number of metrics that can be requested per call'
