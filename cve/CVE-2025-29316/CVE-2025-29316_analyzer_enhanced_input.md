## Vulnerability Description
An issue in DataPatrol Screenshot watermark, printing watermark agent v.3.5.2.0 allows a physically proximate attacker to obtain sensitive information. NOTE the Supplier disputes the Print Job Watermark Bypass claim because the watermark is added by hooking into the OS printing mechanism, and thus is not supposed to be visible when previewing a generated printout on screen. The Supplier disputes the Screenshot Watermark Bypass claim because the products documentation explains the step of setting Developer Tools to Disallowed through AD Group Policy.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-29316 Content

The provided content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it's not directly tied to a CVE ID as the CVE description is a placeholder. However, the gist details a vulnerability in DataPatrol v3.5.2.0 related to watermark bypass. Here's an extraction of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the watermark implementation being applied at the UI level rather than the content rendering level. This allows attackers to bypass the watermark by manipulating the content before it's rendered for screenshots or printing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Bypass of DataPatrol watermark protection.
*   Watermark can be bypassed using standard browser developer tools.
*   Lack of secure content rendering.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized distribution of sensitive content without traceable watermarks.
*   Data leaks without accountability.
*   Breach of compliance standards.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Taking screenshots using browser developer tools (specifically the "Screenshot" command in the Command Menu).
*   Initiating print jobs using browser developer tools (specifically, running `window.print();` in the console).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Access to the DataPatrol application.
*   Ability to use standard browser developer tools (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
*   Basic understanding of how to use browser developer tools.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Implement watermarking at the content rendering level, not just UI layers.
*   Detect and restrict usage of Developer Tools in protected sessions.
*   Disable browser-level printing or screenshots in sensitive views.
*   Employ hardened secure viewers that prevent DOM-level access.

**Additional Details (More than official CVE description):**

The report provides detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability for both screenshot and print job bypasses. It also includes a severity assessment (Medium to High) and a clear conclusion emphasizing the need for immediate remediation. The report is dated February 2, 2025, and was reported by Naif Alshammari.
