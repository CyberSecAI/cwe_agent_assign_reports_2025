# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-52516

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-52516

## Description

Nextcloud Server is a self hosted personal cloud system. When a server is configured to only allow sharing with users that are in ones own groups, after a user was removed from a group, previously shared items were not unshared. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 22.2.11 or 23.0.11 or 24.0.6 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 22.2.11 or 23.0.11 or 24.0.6.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Impact:** previously shared items were not unshared
- **Product:** Nextcloud Server

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-266 | Incorrect Privilege Assignment | 0.9 | Base | Primary CWE | Allowed |
| CWE-269 | Improper Privilege Management | 0.7 | Class | Secondary Candidate | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-266, is a Base level weakness that directly describes the **incorrect privilege assignment** issue. The secondary CWE, CWE-269, is a Class level weakness that represents a broader category of **improper privilege management**. CWE-266 is a child of CWE-269. The vulnerability involves a failure to revoke privileges (access to shared items) when a user's group membership changes, leading to an **incorrect privilege assignment**.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to revoke access** when a user is removed from a group. This leads to users retaining privileges they should no longer have, resulting in unauthorized access to shared items.

Failure to Revoke Access (Root Cause) -> Incorrect Privilege Assignment -> Unauthorized Access (Impact)

## Summary of Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) because the core issue is the system's **failure to correctly assign privileges** based on group membership changes. Specifically, privileges are not revoked when they should be. The vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary both support this.

The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: "The vulnerability stems from the **failure to properly remove shared items** when a user is removed from a group, under the condition that the server is configured to allow sharing only within the same groups." This directly points to an **incorrect privilege assignment**.

The relationship analysis shows that CWE-266 is a more specific child of CWE-269, making it a better fit for the vulnerability because the vulnerability is not an overarching privilege management problem but a specific problem with incorrect assignment.

The retriever results also suggest relevant CWEs related to authorization and access control, such as CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). However, these CWEs are less precise than CWE-266 as they describe broader authorization issues, whereas the described vulnerability is specifically about **incorrect assignment** due to **failure to revoke privileges**.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
