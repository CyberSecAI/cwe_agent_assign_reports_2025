When a server is configured to only allow sharing with users that are in ones own groups, after a user was removed from a group, previously shared items were not unshared. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 22.2.11 or 23.0.11 or 24.0.6 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 22.2.11 or 23.0.11 or 24.0.6.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-52516:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the failure to properly remove shared items when a user is removed from a group, under the condition that the server is configured to allow sharing only within the same groups.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Improper Access Control:** The system does not automatically revoke shares when a user's group membership changes, violating the configured restriction of \"share only with users in the same groups.\"\n*   **Data Leakage:** Due to shares not being removed after group removal, users can potentially retain access to files that they should no longer have access to based on the configured group sharing rules.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized Access:** Users may retain access to files shared with them even after they've been removed from the group(s) that granted them access. This circumvents the intended access control policies.\n*   **Confidentiality Risk:** This could lead to unintentional disclosure of data to users who should not have access to it, violating the confidentiality of the shared information.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   The primary attack vector is through the misconfiguration of a Nextcloud server with the setting to \"only allow sharing with users in the same groups,\" combined with group membership changes.\n*   There is no need for an external attacker. This is a vulnerability that manifests when the system's user management functionality is used, specifically user removal from groups.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be a user who had been previously granted access to a file through a share and then subsequently removed from a group that provided them with shared access.\n*   The attacker does not need to exploit any system vulnerabilities. This is a logic issue with how group memberships interact with sharing rules.\n*   The user must have a valid account on the system, and must have been in a group with the other user that shared the files.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Affected Software:** Nextcloud Server versions 28.0.0 and later, 29.0.0 and later. Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 26.0.0 and later, 27.0.0 and later, 28.0.0 and later, and 29.0.0 and later.\n*   **Patched Versions:** This vulnerability is fixed in Nextcloud Server versions 28.0.9 and 29.0.5. Patches also exist for Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 26.0.13.9, 27.1.11.9, 28.0.9, and 29.0.5.\n*   **Workarounds:** There is no known workaround aside from upgrading.\n*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as \"Low\" in severity.\n*  **CVSS Metrics**: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N\n    *   Attack Vector: Network\n    *   Attack Complexity: High\n    *   Privileges Required: Low\n    *   User Interaction: Required\n    *   Scope: Changed\n    *   Confidentiality: Low\n    *   Integrity: None\n    *   Availability: None\n*   **CWE:** CWE-269, which relates to improper privilege management.\n\nThe provided content gives more insight into the fixes implemented, including code changes that remove shares when a user is removed from a group, ensuring that the shares are correctly revoked.",

The secondary CWE, CWE-269, is a Class level weakness that represents a broader category of **improper privilege management**. CWE-266 is a child of CWE-269. The vulnerability involves a failure to revoke privileges (access to shared items) when a user's group membership changes, leading to an **incorrect privilege assignment**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    \n    cwe266 -->|CHILDOF| cwe269\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe266 primary\n    class cwe269 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to revoke access** when a user is removed from a group. This leads to users retaining privileges they should no longer have, resulting in unauthorized access to shared items.\n\nFailure to Revoke Access (Root Cause) -> Incorrect Privilege Assignment -> Unauthorized Access (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) because the core issue is the system's **failure to correctly assign privileges** based on group membership changes. Specifically, privileges are not revoked when they should be. The vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary both support this.\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary states: \"The vulnerability stems from the **failure to properly remove shared items** when a user is removed from a group, under the condition that the server is configured to allow sharing only within the same groups.\" This directly points to an **incorrect privilege assignment**.\n\nThe relationship analysis shows that CWE-266 is a more specific child of CWE-269, making it a better fit for the vulnerability because the vulnerability is not an overarching privilege management problem but a specific problem with incorrect assignment.\n\nThe retriever results also suggest relevant CWEs related to authorization and access control, such as CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). However, these CWEs are less precise than CWE-266 as they describe broader authorization issues, whereas the described vulnerability is specifically about **incorrect assignment** due to **failure to revoke privileges**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error
