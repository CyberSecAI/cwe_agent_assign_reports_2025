## Vulnerability Description
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the affected product. The vulnerability allows users to save projects within the public directory allowing anyone with local access to modify and/or delete files. Additionally, a malicious user could potentially leverage this vulnerability to escalate their privileges by changing the macro to execute arbitrary code.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** delete files and execute arbitrary code and remote code execution
- **vector:** modify and/or delete files
- **attacker:** malicious user

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the affected software allowing users to save projects within a public directory due to improper input validation. This is tied to the default folder privileges, which grant excessive access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Improper Input Validation (CWE-20): The software does not properly validate the save path, allowing users to save projects in public directories.
    - Inadequate access controls: The default folder privileges allow excessive access, enabling modification or deletion of files by users with local access.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Local attackers can modify or delete project files.
    - A malicious user can escalate privileges by changing the macro to execute arbitrary code.
    - Remote Code Execution through modified project files or macros.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Local access is required.
    - The attack involves saving a project to a public directory, which can be a malicious or modified project.
    - It requires user interaction (UI:R/P) in the sense that the user is likely tricked into opening the malicious project.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker requires local access to the system.
    - The attacker needs to have the ability to save project files, and potentially to modify macros.

The advisory provides more detail than the standard CVE description regarding the specific vector and impact.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set ‚Äì Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* üîç *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* üîç *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion ‚Äì CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### üî∏ CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúA user created with the ‚Äòguest‚Äô role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúThe backup service runs as root but only needs read access.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### üî∏ CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúUser can access another user‚Äôs invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.‚Äù*

## Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *‚ÄúUser can escalate privileges to admin.‚Äù*
> ‚ùå Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged ‚Äì only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ‚úÖ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

* ‚úÖ **CWE-284**: *‚ÄúInconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.‚Äù*
