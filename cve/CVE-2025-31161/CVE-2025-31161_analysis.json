  "description": "CrushFTP 10 before 10.8.4 and 11 before 11.3.1 allows authentication bypass and takeover of the crushadmin account (unless a DMZ proxy instance is used), as exploited in the wild in March and April 2025, aka Unauthenticated HTTP(S) port access. A ****race condition**** exists in the AWS4-HMAC (compatible with S3) authorization method of the HTTP component of the FTP server. The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a ****race condition****, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.",

This vulnerability allows for a web service authentication bypass that affects CrushFTP versions 10.0.0 through 10.8.3 and 11.0.0 through 11.3.0. By exploiting the S3 authentication mechanism, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the server.\n    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is in the S3 authorization method in CrushFTP's HTTP component. It's due to a logic flaw where the *anyPass* parameter doesn't require a password check if set to *true*.\n    *   **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation leads to an authentication bypass, giving the attacker administrative access to the CrushFTP server. This can result in remote code execution in a root or LocalSystem context.\n    *   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves sending an HTTP request with a crafted \"Authorization\" header.\n    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to know a valid username and the format for the crafted \"Authorization\" header.\n    *   **Mitigation or fix:** The text suggests patching to CrushFTP versions 10.8.4 or 11.3.1 and later. It also recommends enabling the DMZ perimeter network option as a workaround if immediate patching isn't possible.\n\n*   **Additional Information**: This content provides more detail than the official CVE description regarding root cause, impact, and attack vectors.\n\n**Content from crushftp.com_941d5655_20250624_202109.html (text)**\n\n*   **Relevance:** The content directly relates to CVE-2025-31161.\n*   **Details:**\n    *   **Vulnerable versions:** CrushFTP 10.0.0 to 10.8.3 and 11.0.0 to 11.3.0 are vulnerable.\n    *   **Mitigation or fix:** Update to 10.8.4+ or 11.3.1+ immediately.\n\n**Content from outpost24.com_26c709c8_20250624_211419.html (text)**\n\n*   **Relevance:** The content directly relates to CVE-2025-31161.\n*   **Details:**\n    *   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is in the HTTP Authorization header processing in CrushFTP.\n    *   **Impact of exploitation:** Allows attackers to gain unauthenticated access to devices running unpatched versions of CrushFTP v10 or v11.\n    *   **Attack vector:** Remote attackers can exploit it.\n    *   **Mitigation or fix:** Users should immediately patch to CrushFTP versions 10.8.4 or 11.3.1 and later. If not possible, enabling the DMZ perimeter network option can serve as a workaround.\n    *   **Additional details:** Provides a step-by-step guide to recreating the issue, and discusses the impact and response from CrushFTP.\n\n**Content from outpost24.com_2c1b289d_20250624_211422.html (text)**\n\n*   **Relevance:** The content discusses the DMZ configuration, but it does not relate to CVE-2025-31161.\n*   **Response:** UNRELATED\n\n**Content from projectdiscovery.io_a79797cd_20250624_202110.html (text)**\n\n*   **Relevance:** The content relates to CVE-2025-31161.\n*   **Details:**\n    *   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the `loginCheckHeaderAuth()` method in `ServerSessionHTTP.java` in CrushFTP's S3 authentication. The `lookup_user_pass` flag, which determined whether a password was required, was passed to the `login_user_pass()` function. This allowed for authentication bypass.\n    *   **Vulnerable versions:** Versions 10.0.0 through 10.8.3 and 11.0.0 through 11.3.0\n    *   **Impact of exploitation:** Allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access, including administrative actions.\n    *   **Attack vector:** Crafting an HTTP request with a specific format for authorization.\n    *   **Proof of concept:** The content provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) for exploitation.\n    *   **Mitigation or fix:** CrushFTP fixed the vulnerability by: (1) Adding a new security parameter, `s3_auth_lookup_password_supported`, set to false by default, and (2) Adding a security check. (3) Reorganizing the authentication flow.\n\n**Content from www.theregister.com_0002d523_20250624_211421.html (text)**\n\n*   **Relevance:** The content directly relates to CVE-2025-31161.\n*   **Details:**\n    *   **Description:** The article reports on the critical vulnerability in CrushFTP's file transfer tech and provides context of a feisty response from the CrushFTP CEO regarding VulnCheck.\n    *   **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability leads to unauthorized access, including admin access.\n\n**Content from www.vicarius.io_0058ce46_20250624_202115.html (text) and www.vicarius.io_2c990294_20250624_202114.html (text)**\n\n*   **Relevance:** The content references CVE-2025-31161.\n*   **Response:** NOINFO.
