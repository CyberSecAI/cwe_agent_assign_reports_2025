- **version:** 3.3.1, 3.3.2 and 3.3.3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5657:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The CraftCMS Two-Factor Authentication plugin (versions 3.3.1 to 3.3.3) was exposing the password hash of the currently authenticated user in the server's response after a successful TOTP submission.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Attributes:** The plugin was unintentionally revealing the user's password hash in the JSON response after a successful two-factor authentication. This violates the principle of least privilege, as the hash should not be accessible.
*   **Authorization Vulnerability:**  The exposure of password hash allows an attacker, who has already compromised a user session, to potentially gain unauthorized access by cracking the hash and reusing the credentials elsewhere.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Password Hash Disclosure:** An attacker with a valid session of a user can obtain the user's password hash.
*   **Potential Account Takeover:** By cracking the password hash, an attacker could gain full control of the user's account, disable MFA, establish new sessions, and perform unauthorized actions.
*   **Credential Stuffing:**  The attacker could use the disclosed password hash (or the cracked password) in credential stuffing attacks against other services where the victim might have reused their password.
*   **Prolonged Access:**  The attacker might be able to access the account beyond the current session lifetime by using the cracked password.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Compromised Session:** The attacker needs to gain control of an active user session (e.g., through session hijacking).
*   **TOTP submission:** The attacker needs to successfully submit a valid TOTP after compromising the session to trigger the disclosure.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Session hijacking:** The attacker must be able to obtain or hijack a valid user session.
*   **Ability to disable/re-enable 2FA:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the plugin to disable and re-enable two-factor authentication and trigger the hash disclosure.
*   **Access to the vulnerable plugin endpoint:** The attacker needs to send requests to the vulnerable plugin endpoints `/index.php?p=admin%2Factions%2Ftwo-factor-authentication%2Fsettings%2Fturn-on` or `/index.php?p=admin%2Factions%2Ftwo-factor-authentication%2Fverify%2Flogin-process`.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.3.4 of the plugin.
*   The issue was present in versions 3.3.1, 3.3.2, and 3.3.3.
*   The plugin is no longer maintained and users are advised to use Craft's native 2FA.
*   The vulnerability was assigned a CVSS base score of 3.7 (Low).
*   The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2022-37783.

- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default "Allow" configuration for its authorization settings.




## CWE-836: Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product records password hashes in a data store, receives a hash of a password from a client, and compares the supplied hash to the hash obtained from the data store.

### Extended Description


Some authentication mechanisms rely on the client to generate the hash for a password, possibly to reduce load on the server or avoid sending the password across the network. However, when the client is used to generate the hash, an attacker can bypass the authentication by obtaining a copy of the hash, e.g. by using SQL injection to compromise a database of authentication credentials, or by exploiting an information exposure. The attacker could then use a modified client to replay the stolen hash without having knowledge of the original password.


As a result, the server-side comparison against a client-side hash does not provide any more security than the use of passwords without hashing.


### Alternative Terms

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use



### Observed Examples

- **CVE-2005-3435:** Product allows attackers to bypass authentication by obtaining the password hash for another user and specifying the hash in the pwd argument.




## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
According to WASC, "Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization."

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships

**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.






## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

### Extended Description
Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties, configuration file, or memory. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2022-30275:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.




## CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product uses a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm or protocol.

### Extended Description


Cryptographic algorithms are the methods by which data is scrambled to prevent observation or influence by unauthorized actors. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data in unexpected ways, spoof identities of other users or devices, or other impacts.


It is very difficult to produce a secure algorithm, and even high-profile algorithms by accomplished cryptographic experts have been broken. Well-known techniques exist to break or weaken various kinds of cryptography. Accordingly, there are a small number of well-understood and heavily studied algorithms that should be used by most products. Using a non-standard or known-insecure algorithm is dangerous because a determined adversary may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected.


Since the state of cryptography advances so rapidly, it is common for an algorithm to be considered "unsafe" even if it was once thought to be strong. This can happen when new attacks are discovered, or if computing power increases so much that the cryptographic algorithm no longer provides the amount of protection that was originally thought.


For a number of reasons, this weakness is even more challenging to manage with hardware deployment of cryptographic algorithms as opposed to software implementation. First, if a flaw is discovered with hardware-implemented cryptography, the flaw cannot be fixed in most cases without a recall of the product, because hardware is not easily replaceable like software. Second, because the hardware product is expected to work for years, the adversary's computing power will only increase over time.

### Additional Notes
**[Maintenance]** Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication. As of CWE 4.6, this work is still ongoing.

## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).

### Extended Description
Capture-replay attacks are common and can be difficult to defeat without cryptography. They are a subset of network injection attacks that rely on observing previously-sent valid commands, then changing them slightly if necessary and resending the same commands to the server.
