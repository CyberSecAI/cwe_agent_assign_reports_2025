More specific Base or Variant level CWEs were also considered to give a more complete description of the **memory corruption** arising from the **race condition**. The chain relationship shows how a race condition can lead to memory corruption vulnerabilities such as Use-After-Free (CWE-416) or Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe416 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe362\n    cwe787 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe362\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe416,cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** (CWE-362) that leads to **memory corruption**. The **memory corruption** could be either a Use-After-Free (CWE-416) or Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787) condition, potentially leading to an exploitable state.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary, which clearly identifies a **race condition** in `nsHttpTransaction` as the root cause, leading to **memory corruption**.\n\nThe initial assessment focused on CWE-362, given the explicit mention of a **race condition**. However, to provide a more complete picture, CWE-416 and CWE-787 were also considered as potential consequences of the **memory corruption** resulting from the **race condition**.\n\nThe final selection includes CWE-362 as the primary CWE, accurately reflecting the root cause. CWE-416 and CWE-787 were included as secondary CWEs, representing potential manifestations of the **memory corruption**.
