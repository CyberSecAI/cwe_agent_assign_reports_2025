  "description": "Lobe Chat is an open-source LLMs/AI chat framework. In affected versions if an attacker can successfully authenticate through SSO/Access Code, they can obtain the real backend API Key by modifying the base URL to their own attack URL on the frontend and setting up a server-side request. This issue has been addressed in version 0.162.25. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

CWE-918 is chosen as the primary because the vulnerability involves modifying the base URL to an attacker-controlled server, indicating a server-side request forgery. CWE-201 is considered as sensitive information is exposed. CWE-346 is included as the origin validation error is present.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe346[\"CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe918 primary\n    class cwe201, cwe346 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper configuration** allowing modification of the base URL in the frontend. This leads to the attacker redirecting requests to their server (**Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**). The requests then contain sensitive API keys (**Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data**), because there is a failure to validate the origin of the request (**Origin Validation Error**), allowing the attacker to obtain the API key and potentially perform unauthorized actions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary, which highlight the ability to modify the base URL and redirect requests containing sensitive data.\n\nThe primary CWE, CWE-918, is a direct result of the ability to modify the base URL on the frontend and force the server to make requests to an arbitrary location. The evidence is that the \"**Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the ability to modify the base URL in the frontend and configure requests to be made server-side, without a proper outbound traffic whitelist. This allows an attacker to redirect requests containing sensitive API keys to their own server.\"\n\nCWE-201 is a secondary vulnerability because the redirected request contains sensitive API keys in the headers. Evidence: \"API key exposed in request headers.\"\n\nCWE-346 is a validation concern where there is no \"**Lack of outbound traffic whitelisting, allowing requests to be sent to arbitrary URLs**.\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity as they directly address the root cause and immediate consequences of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n#
