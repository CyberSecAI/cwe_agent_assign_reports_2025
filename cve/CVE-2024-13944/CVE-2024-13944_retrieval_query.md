    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'Time-of-check to time-of-use'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition (Score: 489.75)

The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state....

### 2. CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') (Score: 431.55)

The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource....
