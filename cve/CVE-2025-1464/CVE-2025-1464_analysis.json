  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Baiyi Cloud Asset Management System up to 20250204. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /wuser/admin.house.collect.php. The manipulation of the argument project_id leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

The `project_id` parameter is vulnerable to malicious SQL injection due to improper input validation.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n*   SQL Injection: Time-Based Blind SQL Injection in the `project_id` parameter.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\n*   Sensitive Data Leakage: Attackers can steal business data, user information, system configurations, etc.\n*   Loss of System Control: Injection attacks may lead to full server compromise.\n*   Business Disruption Risk: Malicious injections can corrupt the database, causing service outages.\n*   Compliance Risks: Data breaches may violate privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR), leading to legal consequences.\n\nAttack vectors:\nCrafting malicious request parameters (`project_id`) to perform Time-Based Blind SQL Injection.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\nAn attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable interface.\n\nMitigation or fix:\n*   Input Filtering and Parameterized Queries: Strictly validate the `project_id` parameter (e.g., enforce integer type) and use prepared statements.\n*   Web Application Firewall (WAF): Deploy WAF rules to block requests containing sensitive keywords.\n*   Code-Level Fixes: Modify the logic in `admin.house.collect.php` to restrict parameter values and implement error message masking.\n*   Regular Security Audits: Use automated tools for penetration testing.\n*   Principle of Least Privilege: Grant database connection accounts only the necessary permissions.\n\n```",
