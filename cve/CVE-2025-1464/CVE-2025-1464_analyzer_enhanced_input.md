- **component:** /wuser/admin.house.collect.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `/wuser/admin.house.collect.php` interface of the Baiyi Cloud Asset Management System. The `project_id` parameter is vulnerable to malicious SQL injection due to improper input validation.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
*   SQL Injection: Time-Based Blind SQL Injection in the `project_id` parameter.

Impact of exploitation:
*   Sensitive Data Leakage: Attackers can steal business data, user information, system configurations, etc.
*   Loss of System Control: Injection attacks may lead to full server compromise.
*   Business Disruption Risk: Malicious injections can corrupt the database, causing service outages.
*   Compliance Risks: Data breaches may violate privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR), leading to legal consequences.

Attack vectors:
Crafting malicious request parameters (`project_id`) to perform Time-Based Blind SQL Injection.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable interface.

Mitigation or fix:
*   Input Filtering and Parameterized Queries: Strictly validate the `project_id` parameter (e.g., enforce integer type) and use prepared statements.
*   Web Application Firewall (WAF): Deploy WAF rules to block requests containing sensitive keywords.
*   Code-Level Fixes: Modify the logic in `admin.house.collect.php` to restrict parameter values and implement error message masking.
*   Regular Security Audits: Use automated tools for penetration testing.
*   Principle of Least Privilege: Grant database connection accounts only the necessary permissions.
