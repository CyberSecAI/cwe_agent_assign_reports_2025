# Summary

| CWE ID  | CWE Name                                                                   | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- | :---------------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ |
| CWE-89  | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('**SQL Injection**') | 1          | Base                    | Primary                       | Allowed                       |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis

The primary CWE is CWE-89, which is a base-level CWE, making it a good fit. CWE-89 is a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')). While CWE-74 is a class-level CWE and related, CWE-89 is more specific and directly addresses the **SQL injection** vulnerability described.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This leads to **SQL Injection**, which allows authenticated attackers to **extract sensitive information from the database**.

1.  **Root Cause:** **Insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient preparation** in SQL query.
2.  **Weakness:** CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('**SQL Injection**'))
3.  **Impact:** Ability to **extract sensitive information from the database**.

## Summary of Analysis

The primary vulnerability is **SQL Injection** (CWE-89) due to **insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient preparation** on the existing SQL query. The vulnerability description explicitly states this, making CWE-89 the most appropriate choice.

The analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically: "The ProfileGrid User Profiles, Groups and Communities plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to blind and time-based SQL Injections via the rid and search parameters in all versions up to, and including, 5.9.4.7 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**."

CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **SQL Injection** vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:
*   **CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')** - The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. This aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description.
