  "description": "Vite is a frontend tooling framework for javascript. Prior to 6.2.6, 6.1.5, 6.0.15, 5.4.18, and 4.5.13, the contents of arbitrary files can be returned to the browser if the dev server is running on Node or Bun. HTTP 1.1 spec (RFC 9112) does not allow # in request-target. Although an attacker can send such a request. For those requests with an invalid request-line (it includes request-target), the spec recommends to reject them with 400 or 301. The same can be said for HTTP 2. On Node and Bun, those requests are not rejected internally and is passed to the user land. For those requests, the value of http.IncomingMessage.url contains #. Vite assumed req.url wont contain # when checking server.fs.deny, allowing those kinds of requests to bypass the check. Only apps explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network (using --host or server.host config option) and running the Vite dev server on runtimes that are not Deno (e.g. Node, Bun) are affected. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.2.6, 6.1.5, 6.0.15, 5.4.18, and 4.5.13.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-32395 based on provided content:\n\n**1. Verification:**\n\nThe provided content details a security vulnerability in Vite (versions >=6.2.0, <=6.2.5, >=6.1.0, <=6.1.4, >=6.0.0, <=6.0.14, >=5.0.0, <=5.4.17, <=4.5.12) related to bypassing the `server.fs.deny` check due to improper handling of requests with `#` in the `request-target`. This aligns with the CVE description, which is now available as CVE-2025-32395.\n\n**2. Extracted Information:**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** HTTP 1.1 spec does not allow `#` in the `request-target`, but Node.js and Bun allow those requests. Vite assumed `req.url` won't contain `#` when checking `server.fs.deny`. Deno handles these requests differently, not including `#` in `req.url`.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation, specifically failing to sanitize or reject requests containing `#` in the request target.  Bypass of file access restrictions (`server.fs.deny`).\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary files can be returned to the browser. This could lead to sensitive information disclosure.\n*   **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack. An attacker can send a crafted HTTP request with `#` in the request target to bypass the `server.fs.deny` check and access arbitrary files.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the Vite dev server (if it's exposed). No authentication is required.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** Upgrade to a patched version of Vite (>=6.2.6, >=6.1.5, >=6.0.15, >=5.4.18, >=4.5.13).\n\n**3. CVSS Score:**\n\n*   CVSS v4: 6.0/10\n*   Attack Vector: Network\n*   Attack Complexity: Low\n*   Attack Requirements: Present\n*   Privileges Required: None\n*   User interaction: Passive\n*   Confidentiality: High\n*   Integrity: None\n*   Availability: None\n\n**4. Additional Details:**\n\nThe content provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating how to read `/etc/passwd` using a crafted request. It also details the relevant RFC specifications regarding the use of `#` in HTTP requests. The advisory credits @do9gy-msec and @sw0rd1ight for reporting the vulnerability.",

While there are many possible specific input validation CWEs, the evidence also points toward path traversal, so CWE-22 was also selected.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    \n    cwe22 -->|PEEROF| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe22 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **improper input validation** (CWE-20), specifically the failure to sanitize or reject requests containing `#` in the request target. This leads to a bypass of file access restrictions (`server.fs.deny`), allowing an attacker to access arbitrary files. The final impact is the disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **improper input validation** as the root cause. The Vite dev server **incorrectly assumes** that `req.url` will not contain `#` when checking `server.fs.deny`, leading to a bypass of security checks.\n\nThe vulnerability description states that \"Vite assumed req.url wont contain # when checking server.fs.deny, allowing those kinds of requests to bypass the check.\" This clearly indicates a failure to properly validate input, which aligns with CWE-20.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the connection between general input validation issues and more specific vulnerabilities like path traversal (CWE-22). Since the vulnerability involves bypassing file access restrictions, CWE-22 was considered a relevant secondary weakness.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity. CWE-20 captures the general **improper input validation** issue, while CWE-22 highlights the specific path traversal aspect of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
