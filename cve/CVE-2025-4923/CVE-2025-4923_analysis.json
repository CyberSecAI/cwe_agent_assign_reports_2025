  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-4923 Content\n\nThis content **relates** to a vulnerability, but it does not directly reference CVE-2025-4923. It details a file upload vulnerability in Sourcecodester Client Database Management System V1.0.  It provides more detail than a typical CVE description.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n* Insufficient user input validation of the \"uploaded_file_cancelled\" parameter in `/user_delivery_update.php`. This allows an attacker to upload a malicious script file.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n* File Upload Vulnerability\n* Lack of input validation\n* Potential for arbitrary code execution\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n* Unauthorized database access\n* Sensitive data leakage\n* Data tampering\n* Comprehensive system control\n* Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n* Uploading a malicious PHP script via the \"uploaded_file_cancelled\" parameter in a POST request to `/cdm/user_delivery_update.php`.\n* No login or authorization is required.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n* Unauthenticated attacker\n* Ability to send a crafted POST request.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n* **Validate File Type:** Check MIME type and extension against an allowlist.\n* **Validate File Size:** Restrict maximum file size.\n* **Rename Uploaded Files:** Generate random/unique server-side filenames.\n* **Disable Script Execution:**  Disable script execution in the upload directory (e.g., using `.htaccess`).\n\n**Payload Example:**\n\nA sample POST request payload is provided, including a PHP script disguised as an image:\n\n```\nPOST /cdm/user_delivery_update.php HTTP/1.1\n...\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"uploaded_file_cancelled\"; filename=\"1.php\"\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\n\n<?php phpinfo();?>\n...\n```\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The issue was reported on May 16, 2025.\n*   Screenshots demonstrate successful exploitation and access to the uploaded file.\n*   Vendor Homepage: <https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/17514/client-database-management-system.html>\n*   Software Link: <https://www.sourcecodester.com>",

CWE-434 is a base-level CWE, offering a specific description of the **unrestricted upload** issue. CWE-184, Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs, can precede CWE-434, indicating that the **unrestricted upload** can be a consequence of an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    cwe184[\"CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\"]\n\n    cwe184 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe434\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe434 primary\n    class cwe184 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **incomplete list of disallowed inputs** (CWE-184), leading to an **unrestricted upload of a file with a dangerous type** (CWE-434).

The primary CWE, CWE-434, directly addresses this weakness. The evidence for this is found in the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**, which highlights \"**weakness: unrestricted upload**\". Further supporting evidence is in the **Analysis of CVE-2025-4923 Content**, which states: \"Insufficient user input validation of the 'uploaded_file_cancelled' parameter in `/user_delivery_update.php`.
