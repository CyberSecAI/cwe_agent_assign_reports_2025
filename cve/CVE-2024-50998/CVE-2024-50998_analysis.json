CWE-400 is a parent of CWE-770, which is related to resource allocation issues. The relationship that influences my decision is the parent-child relationship between CWE-400 and CWE-770, as denial of service is a form of uncontrolled resource consumption.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n    class cwe770 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **stack overflow** (CWE-121) due to the `openvpn_service_port` and `openvpn_service_port_tun` parameters, leading to a Denial of Service (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that there are multiple **stack overflow** vulnerabilities in the component `openvpn.cgi`. The `openvpn_service_port` and `openvpn_service_port_tun` parameters are the points of entry for the crafted POST request. The impact is a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), as the vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. The retriever results also list CWE-121 as the top combined result.\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is considered as a secondary CWE because the impact of the vulnerability is a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) was considered but not selected, as the description specifies the type of buffer overflow as a **stack overflow**. CWE-20 is a high-level class and is discouraged when more specific CWEs are available.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: CWE-77 is often misused when OS command injection (CWE-78) was intended instead [REF-1287].\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
