  "cve_id": "CVE-2024-1873",
  "description": "parisneo/lollms-webui is vulnerable to **path traversal** and denial of service attacks due to an exposed `/select_database` endpoint in version a9d16b0. The endpoint improperly handles file paths, allowing attackers to specify absolute paths when interacting with the `DiscussionsDB` instance. This flaw enables attackers to create directories anywhere on the system where the application has permissions, potentially leading to denial of service by creating directories with names of critical files, such as HTTPS certificate files, causing server startup failures. Additionally, attackers can manipulate the database path, resulting in the loss of client data by constantly changing the file location to an attacker-controlled location, scattering the data across the filesystem and making recovery difficult.",

CWE-36 is a child of the broader CWE-22, Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'). CWE-73, External Control of File Name or Path, is related as it describes the general case where user input influences file paths. The vulnerability description clearly indicates the use of absolute paths, making CWE-36 the most appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe36[\"CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n\n    cwe36 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    cwe73 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe36\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe36 primary\n    class cwe22,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper file handling** of the `/select_database` endpoint, specifically the lack of proper sanitization of file paths. This leads to **path traversal** (CWE-36), allowing attackers to specify absolute paths. The impact of this is data loss and denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified path traversal as a key weakness. After further analysis, the use of absolute paths in the vulnerability description made CWE-36 the best fit. The retriever results and graph relationships support this choice. The evidence from the vulnerability description, specifically the ability to specify absolute paths, strongly supports the selection of CWE-36.\n\nThe selection of CWE-36 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the absolute path traversal aspect of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.555\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct an absolute pathname, but it does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the intended directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Justification of each selected CWE\n*   **CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal**\n    *   **Technical Explanation:** The vulnerability description explicitly states that the `/select_database` endpoint improperly handles file paths, allowing attackers to specify absolute paths.
