  "description": "matrix-js-sdk is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript and TypeScript. In matrix-js-sdk versions versions 9.11.0 through 34.7.0, the method `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys` is vulnerable to interception by malicious homeservers. The method was introduced by MSC3061) and is commonly used to share historical message keys with newly invited users, granting them access to past messages in the room. However, it unconditionally sends these shared keys to all of the invited users devices, regardless of whether the users cryptographic identity is verified or whether the users devices are signed by that identity. This allows the attacker to potentially inject its own devices to receive sensitive historical keys without proper security checks. Note that this only affects clients running the SDK with the legacy crypto stack. Clients using the new Rust cryptography stack (i.e. those that call `MatrixClient.initRustCrypto()` instead of `MatrixClient.initCrypto()`) are unaffected by this vulnerability, because `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys()` raises an exception in such environments. The vulnerability was fixed in matrix-js-sdk 34.8.0 by removing the vulnerable functionality. As a workaround, remove use of affected functionality from clients.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47080:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys` method in the `matrix-js-sdk`. This method, intended to share historical message keys with newly invited users, was implemented insecurely. It unconditionally sent these keys to *all* of the invited user's devices, regardless of whether those devices were verified or signed by the user's identity.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Lack of Device Verification:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper checks to verify the authenticity and trustworthiness of the recipient devices before sharing encryption keys. This allows malicious actors to potentially intercept keys by injecting their own devices to receive the shared keys.\n*   **Unconditional Key Sharing:** The method sends keys to all devices without any validation of device ownership, making the process inherently insecure.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Interception of Encrypted Messages:** A malicious homeserver or an attacker with control over an unverified device can intercept the shared historical message keys. This enables the attacker to decrypt and read the past messages in the room, thus bypassing the end-to-end encryption.\n*   **Breach of Privacy:** Unauthorized access to past messages compromises user privacy.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Malicious Homeserver:** A malicious homeserver could inject its own devices into the recipient's device list, enabling it to receive the shared keys.\n*   **Compromised Devices:** An attacker who has compromised one of the recipient's devices can gain access to past encrypted messages if the keys are shared with the compromised device.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Control over a Homeserver (or ability to manipulate device lists):** An attacker needs to be able to manipulate the device list of a user to inject their own devices. This can be done via a malicious homeserver or by compromising a homeserver.\n*   **Ability to receive shared keys:** The attacker needs a device on the target user's account, or the ability to add a device to it.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability affects clients using the legacy crypto stack of the `matrix-js-sdk`.\n*   Clients using the newer Rust crypto stack are not affected, as `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys()` raises an exception in those environments.\n*   The vulnerable functionality was removed in `matrix-js-sdk` version 34.8.0, which is the recommended fix.\n*   The vulnerability is related to MSC3061, which is a proposal for sharing room keys for past messages. This MSC was ultimately reverted due to the security concerns highlighted by this vulnerability.\n\nThe provided content contains more details than the standard CVE description would typically contain, offering insights into the specific implementation issues and the surrounding context of the vulnerability.",

CWE-290 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred, and captures the essence of bypassing authentication via spoofing. CWE-347 is related because the cryptographic signature wasn't properly verified, which led to the spoofing. CWE-306 is also related because a critical function lacked authentication.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe290[\"CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\"]\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe310[\"CWE-310: Cryptographic Issues\"]\n    \n    cwe290 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe310\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe290 primary\n    class cwe347,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper security checks** in the `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys` method, which leads to the ability for malicious homeservers to inject devices and **receive sensitive historical keys**. This leads to **Authentication Bypass by Spoofing**.\n  - Root Cause: **Improper security checks** leading to **lack of device verification** and **unconditional key sharing**.\n  - Weakness: **Authentication Bypass by Spoofing (CWE-290)**\n  - Impact: Interception of encrypted messages, breach of privacy.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points towards authentication and cryptographic issues. The vulnerability allows malicious homeservers to inject devices and receive sensitive historical keys due to **improper security checks**. This maps directly to CWE-290, Authentication Bypass by Spoofing, as the primary weakness. The retriever results also highly ranked CWE-290.\n\nThe evidence supporting this assessment comes directly from the vulnerability description and CVE reference: \"However, it unconditionally sends these shared keys to all of the invited users devices, regardless of whether the users cryptographic identity is verified or whether the users devices are signed by that identity. This allows the attacker to potentially inject its own devices to receive sensitive historical keys without proper security checks.\"\n\nThe graph relationships reinforce this selection, showing CWE-290 as a base level weakness related to authentication issues. CWE-347 is a secondary consideration because the core issue is about bypassing authentication, not primarily about cryptographic signature verification. CWE-306 is also a secondary consideration because the core issue is related to spoofing the authentication.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-290 being a base level weakness that accurately represents the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThis attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
