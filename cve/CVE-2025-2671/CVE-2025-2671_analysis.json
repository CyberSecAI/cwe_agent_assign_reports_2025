  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Yue Lao Blind Box up to 4.0. It has been declared as critical. This vulnerability affects the function base64image of the file /app/controller/Upload.php. The manipulation of the argument data leads to **unrestricted upload**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "The content relates to a potential vulnerability in a dating platform application. It provides more detail than a typical CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe application directly decodes Base64 encoded data and saves it without filtering the file extension.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Unfiltered file upload\n*   Direct Base64 decoding without validation\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nThe vulnerability allows for the upload and execution of arbitrary PHP code. The example demonstrates uploading a PHP backdoor.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Uploading a Base64 encoded PHP script via the `data` parameter in a POST request to the `Upload.php` controller. The example payload is: `data=data%3aimage/php%3bbase64,PD9waHAKZXZhbCgkX1BPU1RbMV0pOwoKPz4%3d`\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the application's upload endpoint. No authentication is mentioned as being required.\n*   Knowledge of Base64 encoding.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Implement strict file extension filtering.\n*   Validate the content type of uploaded files.\n*   Avoid directly decoding and saving Base64 encoded data without proper sanitization and validation.",

This aligns directly with the vulnerability description. CWE-184 is a parent of CWE-692, suggesting that an incomplete list of disallowed inputs could lead to unrestricted uploads.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    cwe184[\"CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\"]\n    cwe692[\"CWE-692: Incomplete Blacklist\"]\n\n    cwe184 -->|PARENTOF| cwe692\n    cwe184 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe434\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe434 primary\n    class cwe184 secondary\n    class cwe692 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **unrestricted upload** due to **missing input validation** and filtering of file extensions, leading to the ability to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is clearly **unrestricted upload** of dangerous files (CWE-434) because the application directly decodes Base64 data and saves it without filtering the file extension. This allows an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code, as demonstrated by the provided example. The evidence is strong, with the CVE reference explicitly mentioning the **unfiltered file upload** as a key weakness.\n\nCWE-434 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level.\n\nCWE-184 (Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs) is considered as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability stems from an incomplete or non-existent list of disallowed file types. This CWE could precede CWE-434 in the vulnerability chain.\n\nI considered other CWEs from the retriever results, such as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')), CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')), and CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')), but these are not applicable to this specific vulnerability, as it directly involves uploading and executing dangerous files rather than other types of injection or traversal.",
