It provides detailed information about the vulnerability, affected products, and mitigation steps.\n\nHere's an extraction of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   **CVE-2025-23093:** Privilege escalation due to the execution of a resource with unnecessary privileges in the Platform component of OpenScape 4000 and OpenScape 4000 Manager.\n*   **CVE-2025-23094:** Command injection due to insufficient parameter sanitization in the Platform component of OpenScape 4000 and OpenScape 4000 Manager.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Privilege escalation\n*   Command injection\n*   Insufficient parameter sanitization\n*   Execution of resources with unnecessary privileges\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **CVE-2025-23093:** An authenticated attacker could execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges, potentially impacting confidentiality, integrity, and availability. A non-administrative user could gain full control.\n*   **CVE-2025-23094:** An unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the same privilege level as the web access process, resulting in low impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n*   Exploiting both vulnerabilities together can significantly amplify the impact, potentially resulting in a critical severity.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **CVE-2025-23093:** Requires an authenticated attacker.\n*   **CVE-2025-23094:** Can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **CVE-2025-23093:** Authenticated user.\n*   **CVE-2025-23094:** No authentication required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade to OpenScape 4000 PLT Hotfix (System & Manager) V11 R0.22.2 or later.\n*   Upgrade to OpenScape 4000 PLT Hotfix (System & Manager) V10 R1.54.2 or later.\n*   Upgrade to OpenScape 4000 PLT Hotfix (System & Manager) V10 R1.42.7 or later.\n*   **Workarounds (until patching):**\n    *   Enable \"Restricted access to Platform Portal and SSH of Platform and CSTA\" in Security Mode Configuration.\n    *   Enable Gateway Secure Mode for connected SoftGates and Enterprise Gateways.\n    *   On OpenScape 4000 Manager V10, enable platform secure mode via the command line: `/opt/webservice/scripts/swupdated set_ui_mode 1`.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   Specific affected versions are listed.\n*   Detailed workaround instructions are provided.\n*   Credit is given to the researchers who discovered the vulnerabilities.\n*   CVSS scores are provided (7.8 for CVE-2025-23093, 7.3 for CVE-2025-23094).\n*   The advisory impacts OpenScape 4000 deployment options: Central Host, Manager, SoftGate, Enterprise Gateway and partially STMIX.",

While other CWEs like CWE-266, CWE-269, CWE-284, and CWE-285 were considered, they were either too abstract or didn't precisely capture the root cause. CWE-250 focuses on the execution of a resource with unnecessary privileges, which directly aligns with the vulnerability description.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe250[\"CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges\"]\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe250 -->|PEEROF| cwe266\n    cwe266 -->|CHILDOF| cwe269\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe250 primary\n    class cwe266,cwe269,cwe284,cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **execution of a resource with unnecessary privileges** (CWE-250). This leads to the impact of privilege escalation, allowing an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges. The chain is relatively short and direct in this case.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, supported by the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\", identified the root cause as the **execution of a resource with unnecessary privileges**. The retriever results also highlighted CWE-250 as the top candidate. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" further emphasize the \"execution of a resource with unnecessary privileges\" as the core issue.\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-250 is a more specific and appropriate choice compared to the higher-level classes like CWE-269 and CWE-284, or other peer CWEs like CWE-266. While CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) might seem relevant, the key issue isn't the assignment of privileges but rather the execution of a resource with privileges it doesn't need.\n\nThe selection of CWE-250 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly captures the root cause of the vulnerability. Other CWEs were considered but deemed less suitable due to their higher abstraction levels or a mismatch with the specific technical details of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.110\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nCode is executed with privileges that are higher than absolutely necessary, which might allow unintended operations or access to sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Justification:**\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states that the vulnerability is due to \"execution of a resource with unnecessary privileges.\" CWE-250 perfectly matches this description. The vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges, which is a direct consequence of executing a resource with more privileges than required.",
