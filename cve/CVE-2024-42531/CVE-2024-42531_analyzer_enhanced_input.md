## Vulnerability Description
Ezviz Internet PT Camera CS-CV246 D15655150 allows an unauthenticated host to access its live video stream by crafting a set of RTSP packets with a specific set of URLs that can be used to redirect the camera feed. NOTE the vendors perspective is that the Anonymous120386 sample code can establish RTSP protocol communictaion, but cannot obtain video or audio data thus, there is no risk.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
