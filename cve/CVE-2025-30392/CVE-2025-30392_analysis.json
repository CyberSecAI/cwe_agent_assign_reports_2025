The guidance distinguishes between these, suggesting CWE-863 when the authorization check is present but flawed, and CWE-285 for a general or ambiguous authorization failure. Since the description uses the term \"**Improper authorization**\", it implies that an authorization mechanism exists but is not functioning correctly. The guidance suggests that if there is a role check present but flawed, then CWE-863 is the best choice.\n\nThe evidence is somewhat limited as there is no CVE reference link content summary. However, the direct statement of \"**Improper authorization**\" is strong enough evidence to proceed.\n\nTherefore, CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is selected as the primary CWE. CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is considered a secondary candidate due to its more general nature.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-284 (Improper Access Control): Too general. The description clearly points to an authorization problem, not a general access control issue.\n*   CWE-862 (Missing Authorization): The description implies that there is some form of authorization, but it is not functioning correctly. Therefore, CWE-862 is not appropriate.\n*   CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function): This is for missing authentication, but the description does not indicate an authentication issue.\n*   CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment), CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges): These are more specific privilege-related CWEs. The description focuses on the authorization process rather than privilege assignment or execution.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n**CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization**\n\n*   **Technical Explanation:** The product performs an authorization check, but it is implemented incorrectly. This could be due to flawed logic, incorrect configuration, or other errors in the authorization mechanism.\n*   **Security Implications:** An attacker can bypass the authorization check and gain unauthorized access to resources or perform unauthorized actions. This can lead to privilege escalation, data breaches, or other security compromises.\n*   **Relationship Analysis:** ChildOf CWE-285 (Improper Authorization).\n*   **Mapping Guidance Influence:** Allowed-with-Review. The CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate, but there is no information to pick a more specific CWE.\n*   **Why it is primary:** The vulnerability description clearly states that there is \"**Improper authorization**\", suggesting a flawed authorization mechanism, which aligns with the definition of CWE-863.\n\n**CWE-285: Improper Authorization**\n\n*   **Technical Explanation:** The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n*   **Security Implications:** An attacker can bypass the authorization check and gain unauthorized access to resources or perform unauthorized actions. This can lead to privilege escalation, data breaches, or other security compromises.\n*   **Relationship Analysis:** ParentOf CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization).\n*   **Mapping Guidance Influence:** Discouraged. CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead.\n*   **Why it is secondary:** The vulnerability description points towards a general authorization issue, but the term \"**Improper authorization**\" is a better fit to CWE-863, so this is secondary.",
