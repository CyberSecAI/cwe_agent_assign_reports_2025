  "description": "The Linkify Text plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.1. This is due to the plugin **utilizing bootstrap and leaving test files with display_errors on**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.",

The vulnerability involves the exposure of the full path of the web application due to the plugin's configuration. The **root cause** is the **improper configuration** of the plugin, specifically the `display_errors` setting being enabled in production. This leads to the **impact** of full path disclosure.\n\nCWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information) is the most appropriate CWE because it directly addresses the core issue: the plugin **generates an error message that reveals sensitive information** (the full path).
