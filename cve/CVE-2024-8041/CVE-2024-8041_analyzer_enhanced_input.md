## Vulnerability Description
A Denial of Service (DoS) issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions prior to 17.1.6, 17.2 prior to 17.2.4, and 17.3 prior to 17.3.1. A denial of service could occur upon importing a maliciously crafted repository using the GitHub importer.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** denial of service
- **vector:** maliciously crafted repository
- **product:** GitLab CE/EE
- **version:** prior to 17.1.6, 17.2 prior to 17.2.4, and 17.3 prior to 17.3.1
- **component:** GitHub importer

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of response data validation within the Octokit library when processing responses from a GitHub import. Octokit uses the Sawyer library to deserialize response data, and if this data is not validated for size and complexity, an attacker can craft a malicious response that causes excessive memory usage during deserialization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Lack of input validation",
     "Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive memory consumption"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit results in a Denial of Service (DoS) attack where Sidekiq instances are overloaded with high memory usage and crash, potentially affecting the entire fleet. The attacker can poison the job queue, requiring manual intervention to clear bad jobs and disrupt other services.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by importing a repository from a malicious GitHub server using the `POST /api/v4/import/github` endpoint in GitLab.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires: 1. Ability to set up a dummy GitHub server. 2. A GitLab Personal Access Token (PAT). 3. Crafting and sending a malicious payload within a response to Octokit via a repository import request."
