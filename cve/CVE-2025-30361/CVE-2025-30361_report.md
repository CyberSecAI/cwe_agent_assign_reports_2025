# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-30361

## Description

WeGIA is a Web manager for charitable institutions. A security vulnerability was identified in versions prior to 3.2.6, where it is possible to change a users password without verifying the old password. This issue exists in the control.php endpoint and allows unauthorized attackers to bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms to reset the password of any user, including admin accounts. Version 3.2.6 fixes the issue.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Impact:** ['reset the password of any user', 'bypass authentication']
- **Attacker:** unauthorized attackers
- **Product:** WeGIA
- **Version:** prior to 3.2.6
- **Component:** control.php endpoint

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-620 | Unverified Password Change | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.7 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-620, which is at the Base level. CWE-306 was considered because the **missing** old password check effectively bypasses authentication for the password change functionality. However, since the primary issue is specifically related to the password change process, CWE-620 is the more accurate and specific classification. Both CWE-620 and CWE-306 are related to broader authentication and authorization issues, but CWE-620 focuses on the specific weakness.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing** old password verification, leading to the ability to change a user's password without proper authentication. This results in an attacker being able to bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms and gain unauthorized access, including resetting admin accounts.

Root Cause: **Missing** old password verification in the password change process (CWE-620).
Impact: Authentication bypass and unauthorized access (potentially CWE-306, but more a consequence of CWE-620).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified the **lack of old password verification** as the primary weakness, leading to the selection of CWE-620. The CVE content summary confirms this, stating "The vulnerability stems from the **lack of old password verification** when changing a user's password." The retriever results also listed CWE-620 as a top candidate.

CWE-306 was considered because the **missing** password verification step allows an attacker to perform a critical function (changing a password) without proper authentication. However, since the issue is specifically about changing a password, CWE-620 is the more precise classification. The guidance on Authentication vs Authorization notes that "CWE-306: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* â€“ used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion)." While this is applicable, the core issue is how the password change is implemented.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-620 directly addresses the **lack of old password verification**, and while CWE-306 is relevant, it describes the broader impact of the vulnerability. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference links supports this decision.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
