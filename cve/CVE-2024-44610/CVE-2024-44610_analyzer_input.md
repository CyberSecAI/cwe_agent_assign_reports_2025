# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-44610

## Vulnerability Description
PCAN-Ethernet Gateway FD before 1.3.0 and PCAN-Ethernet Gateway before 2.11.0 are vulnerable to **Command injection** via shell metacharacters in a Software Update to processing.php.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **Command injection**
- **product:** PCAN-Ethernet Gateway
- **version:** before 1.3.0 and before 2.11.0
- **component:** Software Update to processing.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from two command injection flaws in the PEAK PCAN-Ethernet Gateway (FD) DR firmware.

**Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses:**
1. **Command Injection in Firmware Update:** The web interface allows uploading firmware update packages. The filename of this package is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject shell commands within it. This command is then executed by the webserver as the `www-data` user.
2. **Command Injection in `/home/peak/updater`:** The `/home/peak/updater` binary executes the provided filename argument using `system()`, which results in a command injection. This command is executed as root via sudo, which is also vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows a remote attacker with valid web interface credentials to execute arbitrary code as root on the affected device, potentially leading to full compromise of the device. This can be achieved by using a chain of command injection vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the web interface of the PCAN-Ethernet Gateway.
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the web interface.
- The attacker must upload a malicious firmware update package and trigger the firmware update process.
- Alternatively, the attacker can directly trigger the updater via sudo.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the PCAN-Ethernet Gateway device.
- The attacker must possess valid credentials to log into the web interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content gives more details about the vulnerabilities, such as the specific command injection points.
- The content also provides proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code and instructions for using it, with links to related github repository.
- Additionally, the vendor has provided fixes for the vulnerability.
