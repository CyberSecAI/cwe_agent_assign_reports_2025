This can lead to resource exhaustion, which is reflected in CWE-770 and its parent CWE-400. CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400, so it is more specific and a better fit, but they are related. There are several other CWEs that could be involved, but the evidence points to incorrect buffer size calculation as the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe131[\"CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe131 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe770\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe131 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n    class cwe400 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect calculation of buffer size** (CWE-131). This leads to excessive resource allocation (CWE-770) and ultimately results in a denial-of-service (DoS), which is a form of uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the primary weakness is CWE-131 (**incorrect calculation of buffer size**), which directly leads to a denial-of-service. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **incorrect calculation of buffer size** as the root cause.\n\nThe evidence is: \"An unauthenticated remote attacker can use a malicious OPC UA client to send a crafted request to affected CODESYS products which can cause a DoS due to **incorrect calculation of buffer size**.\"\n\nCWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) and CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) are considered secondary because they describe the impact of the primary weakness.
