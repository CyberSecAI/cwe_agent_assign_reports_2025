{
  "query": "A Cross-Protocol Scripting vulnerability is found in Apache Kvrocks. Since Kvrocks didnt detect if Host or POST appears in RESP requests, a valid HTTP request can also be sent to Kvrocks as a valid RESP request and trigger some database operations, which can be dangerous when it is chained with SSRF. It is similiar to CVE-2016-10517 in Redis. This issue affects Apache Kvrocks from the initial version to the latest version 2.11.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.11.1, which fixes the issue.",
