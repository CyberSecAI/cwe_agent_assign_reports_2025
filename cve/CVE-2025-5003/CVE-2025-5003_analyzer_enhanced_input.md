## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE Content

This content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it is not directly tied to a CVE ID as the CVE description is a placeholder. The content details a SQL injection vulnerability in "Projectworlds Online Time Table Generator PHP MYSQL V1.0". It provides more detail than a standard CVE description would.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/semester_ajax.php` file due to insufficient user input validation of the `id` parameter. The parameter is used directly in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   Comprehensive system control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The `id` parameter in a GET request to `/semester_ajax.php` is vulnerable.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** Separate SQL code from user input data.
2.  **Input validation and filtering:** Validate and filter user input to ensure it conforms to the expected format.
3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** Use database accounts with the minimum necessary permissions.
4.  **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.

**Payload Examples:**

*   **Time-based blind SQL injection:** `id=1'AND(SELECT 6937 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))qxsd)AND 'SMQM'='SMQM`
*   **UNION query:** `id=1' UNION ALL SELECT NULL,CONCAT(0x7178786271.0x686b5572626a456d6776587651775278516975577776754d775a596fu75358706a4e75434a616279,0x7171707a71),NULL`

**Tools Used for Verification:**

*   sqlmap (example command provided: `python sqlmap.py -r sqli.txt -p id --batch`)
