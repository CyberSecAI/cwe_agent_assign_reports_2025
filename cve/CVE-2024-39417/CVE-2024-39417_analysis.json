The choice of CWE-285 is based on the explicit mention of \"Improper Authorization\" as the root cause, making it a more specific and appropriate classification than its parent, CWE-284. CWE-862 and CWE-863 were considered as peer alternatives within the authorization category, but CWE-285 was chosen as the best fit due to its broader applicability to flawed authorization logic in general. The class abstraction level is appropriate given the available information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe284,cwe862,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Improper Authorization** (**CWE-285**) that leads to a security feature bypass. The low-privileged attacker can then disclose minor information.\n  - **Root Cause:** **CWE-285** Improper Authorization\n  - **Impact:** Security Feature Bypass\n  - **Secondary Impact:** Minor Information Disclosure\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description and key phrases, pointed towards an authorization issue. The retriever results and the provided guidance reinforced this, highlighting CWE-285 as a strong candidate. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly identifies \"Improper Authorization\" as the root cause and links it to CWE-285, further solidifying this choice.\n\nThe selection of CWE-285 is primarily based on the explicit statement in the vulnerability description: \"**Improper Authorization vulnerability**\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section also confirms this: \"Root Cause: Improper Authorization ([CWE-285](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/285.html))\". The retriever results also indicated CWE-285 was a strong candidate.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision by highlighting the hierarchy of access control related CWEs. While CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) is a parent of CWE-285, the more specific CWE-285 was chosen because the description explicitly mentions \"Improper Authorization\".\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-285 directly addresses the **root cause** identified in the vulnerability description and reference links content summary. While more specific variants might exist, the available information does not provide sufficient detail to justify their use.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
