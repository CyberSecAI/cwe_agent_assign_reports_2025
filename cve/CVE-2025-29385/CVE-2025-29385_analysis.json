CWE-121 is a variant of buffer overflow, specifically occurring on the stack, aligning perfectly with the provided information. Other CWEs related to buffer overflows were considered, but CWE-121 was the most specific and accurate representation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **stack overflow** in the `cloneType` parameter of `/goform/AdvSetMacMtuWan`, leading to remote arbitrary code execution. The root cause is the **lack of proper bounds checking**, resulting in the overflow.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description indicating a **stack overflow** in the `cloneType` parameter. The description directly aligns with CWE-121, \"Stack-based Buffer Overflow.\" The high retriever score and the explicit mention of \"stack overflow\" provide strong evidence for this classification. The retriever results confirm that CWE-121 is the best match.
