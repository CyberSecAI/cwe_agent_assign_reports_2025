## Vulnerability Description
The 3DPrint Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the infill_text parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.3.6 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**
- **weakness:** **SQL injection**
- **impact:** append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **product:** 3DPrint Lite plugin for WordPress
- **version:** all versions up to and including 2.1.3.6
- **component:** infill_text parameter

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, this relates to CVE-2025-3427 as it describes a "Security fix" included in changesets for the 3dprint-lite WordPress plugin. The content provides more detail than a standard CVE description.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** Not explicitly stated, but the changesets indicate a security issue was addressed.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The changes involve adding nonce verification to several admin functions: `clone` and `add` actions for printers, materials, coatings, and infills. This suggests a potential vulnerability related to missing or insufficient nonce validation, potentially allowing for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks or unauthorized modification of data.
* **Impact of exploitation:**  Without more details, the impact is unclear, but could include unauthorized creation, modification, or deletion of printer, material, coating, or infill data within the plugin.
* **Attack vectors:** Likely CSRF, potentially other attacks exploiting the lack of nonce validation.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to craft malicious requests and potentially trick an authenticated administrator into executing them.
* **Mitigation or fix:** The changesets implement nonce verification using `wp_verify_nonce()` for the `clone` and `add` actions in the admin interface, mitigating the vulnerability. Specifically, the code now checks `if (!wp_verify_nonce(sanitize_key( $_REQUEST['\_wpnonce'] ), 'sp_clone_...' ))` and `if (!wp_verify_nonce(sanitize_key( $_REQUEST['\_wpnonce'] ), 'sp_add_...' ))` before performing sensitive operations.

The changelog in `readme.txt` confirms the fix: "= 2.1.3.6 = Security fix".
