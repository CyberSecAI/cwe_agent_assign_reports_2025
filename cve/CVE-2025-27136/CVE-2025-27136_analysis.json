  "description": "LocalS3 is an Amazon S3 mock service for testing and local development. Prior to version 1.21, the LocalS3 services bucket creation endpoint is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection. When processing the CreateBucketConfiguration XML document during bucket creation, the services XML parser is configured to resolve external entities. This allows an attacker to declare an external entity that references an internal URL, which the server will then attempt to fetch when parsing the XML. The vulnerability specifically occurs in the location constraint processing, where the XML parser resolves external entities without proper validation or restrictions. When the external entity is resolved, the server makes an HTTP request to the specified URL and includes the response content in the parsed XML document. This vulnerability can be exploited to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks, allowing an attacker to make requests to internal services or resources that should not be accessible from external networks. The server will include the responses from these internal requests in the resulting bucket configuration, effectively leaking sensitive information. The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the LocalS3 service to exploit this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-27136 based on provided content:\n\nThe provided content is directly related to CVE-2025-27136. It details an XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability in the LocalS3 service. Here's a breakdown of the information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe LocalS3 service's bucket creation endpoint is vulnerable because the XML parser is configured to resolve external entities when processing the `CreateBucketConfiguration` XML document.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core vulnerability.\n*   Lack of proper validation or restrictions on external entity resolution within the XML parser.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker can make the server perform HTTP requests to internal networks and services.\n*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:**  Internal resources and data can be leaked.\n*   Potential for further attacks against internal systems.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Sending a crafted XML document (specifically a `PUT` request to create a bucket) containing an external entity declaration pointing to an internal URL.\n*   The example provided uses `http://internal-web/flag.txt` as the target URL.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the LocalS3 service (unauthenticated).\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Disable XML external entity resolution:**  Specifically, set `XMLInputFactory.SUPPORT_DTD` and `XMLInputFactory.IS_SUPPORTING_EXTERNAL_ENTITIES` to `Boolean.FALSE`.\n*   **Input Validation:** Reject XML documents containing DOCTYPE declarations or external entity references.\n*   **Secure XML Parser Configuration:** Use XML parsers configured securely by default.\n*   **Whitelist Allowed URLs:** If external entity processing is absolutely necessary, implement a whitelist and validate all URLs.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The commit message and code diffs show the specific changes made to disable external entities and DTDs in the `WstxInputFactory` used by the XML parser.  The fix is implemented in both `LocalS3.java` and `XmlUtils.java`.\n*   The vulnerability was detected using XBOW, an autonomous vulnerability finding system.\n*   The vulnerability affects version 1.20 of the software.\n*   A 90-day disclosure policy is in place.\n*   The vulnerability is rated as \"Moderate\" severity.",
