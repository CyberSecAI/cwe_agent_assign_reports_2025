  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-1864 based on provided content:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-1864\n\n**Relates to CVE:** YES\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability is an improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer, leading to overflow buffers in radareorg radare2. The root cause is a missing security patch in the `magic_file_check_mem()` function that was present in the `file/file` project and fixed in commit `6713ca4`.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within Bounds.\n*   Buffer Overflow\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nThe CVSS v4 score indicates a Critical severity (10.0/10) with High impact to Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.  The subsequent system impact metrics also show High impact across all three areas.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Network (Attack Vector)\n*   Low Attack Complexity\n*   No Privileges Required\n*   No User Interaction\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\nThe attacker requires no privileges and no user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. The attack can be launched remotely over the network.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade radare2 to version `<5.9.9`.\n*   The fix involves applying the patch from `file/file@6713ca4` to radare2.\n*   rizinorg/rizin backported the fix in commit `f833c7a` and `e0a4096`.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The vulnerability was initially identified and fixed in the `file/file` project.\n*   The pull request #23981 in radareorg/radare2 implements the fix.\n*   The EPSS score is 0.061% (19th percentile), estimating a low probability of exploitation within the next 30 days.\n*   The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2025-1864 and GHSA-qp2x-2vj2-93c6.\n*   The fix has also been applied to the rizin project.\n*   The vulnerability affects the `magic` library.",
