  "description": "Vite a frontend build tooling framework for javascript. In affected versions the contents of arbitrary files can be returned to the browser. `@fs` denies access to files outside of Vite serving allow list. Adding `?import&raw` to the URL bypasses this limitation and returns the file content if it exists. This issue has been patched in versions 5.4.6, 5.3.6, 5.2.14, 4.5.5, and 3.2.11. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45811:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability arises from the improper handling of `?import&raw` queries within Vite's file serving mechanism. Specifically, the `@fs` path, intended to restrict access to files outside the allowed list, is bypassed when this query parameter is added to the URL.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Bypass of Access Controls:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the intended restrictions of `server.fs.deny` by using the `?import&raw` query parameter.\n- **Information Disclosure:** This bypass allows an attacker to retrieve the contents of arbitrary files on the server's filesystem.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Confidentiality Breach:** The primary impact is the disclosure of sensitive information. Attackers can read the content of files outside the intended serving scope, which could include configuration files, source code, or other sensitive data.\n- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Depending on the nature of the exposed data, this vulnerability could be a stepping stone for further attacks.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploited through network requests, specifically HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable Vite development server.\n- **URL Manipulation:** Attackers must append the `?import&raw` query string to a crafted URL that includes the `@fs` path.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to make network requests to the Vite development server.\n- **Understanding of Vite's URL Structure:** The attacker needs knowledge of the `@fs` path and the usage of the `?import&raw` parameter.\n- **User Interaction:** Although the CVSS score indicates user interaction is required, this is misleading, as the interaction refers to a victim *visiting* the malicious webpage, thus triggering the request.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability is triggered when requesting a file outside the allowed serving list using the `@fs` prefix.\n- The proof of concept demonstrates how to bypass the intended 403 Forbidden error using the `?import&raw` parameter.\n- The vulnerability affects Vite versions ranging from 3.2.10 up to 5.4.5.\n- The fix involves ensuring proper validation and access control when handling the `?import&raw` parameter.\n- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-200 (Information Exposure) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).",

The vulnerability involves bypassing access controls intended to restrict file access. **CWE-200 [Information Exposure]** is a related class-level CWE, representing the direct consequence of the access control bypass. **CWE-22 [Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')]**, a base-level CWE, is considered since the vulnerability involves accessing files outside of the allowed directory, but it's less precise than **CWE-284 [Improper Access Control]** because the described bypass doesn't necessarily rely on path traversal techniques.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|RESULTING_IMPACT| cwe284\n    cwe22 -->|PEEROF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe22 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **improper access control** (**CWE-284 [Improper Access Control]**) which allows bypassing the `@fs` restriction. This leads to **information exposure** (**CWE-200 [Information Exposure]**) because the contents of arbitrary files can then be accessed.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis identifies **CWE-284 [Improper Access Control]** as the primary weakness, with **CWE-200 [Information Exposure]** as a secondary impact.
