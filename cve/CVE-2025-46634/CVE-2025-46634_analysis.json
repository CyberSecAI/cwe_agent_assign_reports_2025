While CWE-311 is a broader category, CWE-319 is a more specific case of transmitting sensitive information in cleartext. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **cleartext transmission**, making CWE-319 a more accurate and specific classification. CWE-294 can follow CWE-319, because the cleartext transmission allows an attacker to replay the captured traffic.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe294[\"CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\"]\n\n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    cwe319 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe294\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe311,cwe294 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **cleartext transmission of the password hash** (CWE-319). This allows an attacker to capture the hash and replay it, leading to **authentication bypass** (CWE-294).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-319 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of **cleartext transmission of sensitive information** in the vulnerability description. The retriever results also ranked CWE-319 as the top candidate. The relationship analysis confirmed that CWE-319 is a more specific case of CWE-311, making it a more accurate classification. The vulnerability description states that the system implements encryption, but only after the user has transmitted the hash of their password in cleartext. This supports the choice of CWE-319 as the root cause.\n\nThe selection of CWE-319 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately describes the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **cleartext transmission of sensitive information**. The evidence from the vulnerability description directly supports this classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
