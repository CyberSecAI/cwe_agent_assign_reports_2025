The issue arises from the use of a vulnerable version of the starlette package (<=0.49) via fastapi, which was patched in fastapi version 0.115.3. The vulnerability can be exploited by sending multiple requests to the /auth/saml/callback endpoint, leading to uncontrolled memory consumption and eventual denial of service. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-1284 CWE-400 CWE-770 CWE-674 CWE-918 CWE-789 CWE-1333 CWE-307",
