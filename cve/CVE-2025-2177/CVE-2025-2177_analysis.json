  "description": "A vulnerability classified as critical was found in libzvbi up to 0.2.43. This vulnerability affects the function vbi_search_new of the file src/search.c. The manipulation of the argument pat_len leads to **integer overflow**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 0.2.44 is able to address this issue. The patch is identified as ca1672134b3e2962cd392212c73f44f8f4cb489f. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The code maintainer was informed beforehand about the issues. She reacted very fast and highly professional.",

The vulnerability occurs due to an integer overflow when handling the `pat_len` argument in the `vbi_search_new` function. |\n| CWE-131 | Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The integer overflow can lead to an incorrect buffer size calculation, which is a prerequisite for a buffer overflow. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound), which is a base-level CWE. This can lead to CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size) as a consequence. CWE-131 can further lead to buffer overflows like CWE-120 or CWE-787.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe131[\"CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    \n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe131\n    cwe131 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe131 secondary\n    class cwe787 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with:\n1.  **Integer Overflow (CWE-190)**: The **integer overflow** occurs when the `pat_len` argument is manipulated.\n2.  **Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size (CWE-131)**: The **integer overflow** leads to an incorrect calculation of the buffer size.\n3.  **Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)**: The incorrect buffer size calculation can result in a heap overflow or out-of-bounds write.\nThe provided information does not explicitly state the out-of-bounds write but it is the expected result of the overflow.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) in the `vbi_search_new` function, triggered by manipulating the `pat_len` argument. This leads to an incorrect buffer size calculation (CWE-131), which sets the stage for potential buffer overflows. The evidence for CWE-190 is strong, as the vulnerability description explicitly mentions it, and the CVE summary also highlights integer overflows as the root cause. The choice of CWE-190 is specific and at the base level of abstraction, which is preferred. The CVE summary mentions CWE-824 and CWE-908, however those are not the rootcause.\n\nThe Retriever Results also lists CWE-190 as the top candidate. Other CWEs like CWE-79 and CWE-89 are less relevant because the vulnerability is not directly related to web page generation or SQL injection. CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is a potential consequence, but the initial error is the integer overflow.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
