## Vulnerability Description
The Easy Image Collage plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a **missing capability check** on the ajax_image_collage() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.13.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to erase all of the content in arbitrary posts.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-5863:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check within the `ajax_image_collage()` function of the Easy Image Collage WordPress plugin. Specifically, there is no validation to ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to perform the requested action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the lack of a capability check before allowing users to modify post content via the `ajax_image_collage()` function. This means that even users with lower-level access (Contributor and above) can manipulate post data that they would not normally have permission to edit.
- **Insecure AJAX endpoint:** The plugin exposes an AJAX endpoint that handles post data updates but fails to implement the required access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Loss:** Authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access or higher can erase all content from arbitrary posts by exploiting the missing authorization in the `ajax_image_collage()` function. This includes the content of any post type that uses the plugin's shortcode.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network, as the vulnerable function is accessed through an AJAX request.
- **Authenticated access:** Attackers need to have a valid WordPress user account with at least Contributor-level privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker must have a valid WordPress user account with at least the "Contributor" role.
- The attacker needs to be able to make AJAX requests to the WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes a changeset that shows the fix to this vulnerability, which adds capability checks using `current_user_can()`.
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.13.5.
- Version 1.13.6 of the plugin contains the fix for this vulnerability.
