# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-3277

# Vulnerability Description

    An **integer overflow** can be triggered in SQLites `concat_ws()` function. The resulting, truncated integer is then used to allocate a buffer. When SQLite then writes the resulting string to the buffer, it uses the original, untruncated size and thus a wild Heap **Buffer overflow** of size ~4GB can be triggered. This can result in arbitrary code execution.

    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis
    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. 
    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.

    ## WEAKNESS: 'integer overflow'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 490.91)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...

### 2. CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error (Score: 445.20)

Truncation errors occur when a primitive is cast to a primitive of a smaller size and data is lost in the conversion....

### 3. CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types (Score: 435.75)

When converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur....

### 4. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 417.71)

The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties....

### 5. CWE-195: Signed to Unsigned Conversion Error (Score: 417.50)

The product uses a signed primitive and performs a cast to an unsigned primitive, which can produce an unexpected value if the value of the signed primitive can not be represented using an unsigned primitive....

## WEAKNESS: 'Buffer overflow'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 490.91)

When converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur....

### 4. CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read (Score: 423.44)

The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....

### 5. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 417.71)

The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties....
