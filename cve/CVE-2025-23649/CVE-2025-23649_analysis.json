CSRF allows an attacker to induce a user to perform actions without their knowledge or consent. In this case, the **CSRF** vulnerability can be exploited to inject malicious scripts, resulting in Stored XSS.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe352 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **CSRF** vulnerability (CWE-352). An attacker leverages this to trick a user into performing actions, which leads to the injection of malicious scripts. This results in XSS (CWE-79), where the injected script is stored and executed when other users access the affected page.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence which clearly states the presence of a **CSRF** vulnerability that leads to Stored XSS. The **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** section highlights \"**rootcause:** **CSRF**\" and \"**weakness:** **Cross-Site Scripting, XSS**\". The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms the presence of **CSRF** that can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions, leading to XSS.\n\nCWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] is chosen as the primary CWE because the **CSRF** is the root cause that enables the XSS. The **CSRF** allows an attacker to force a user to make a request that injects malicious code.\n\nCWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] is selected as a secondary CWE because the injected payload due to **CSRF** is not properly neutralized and results in XSS.\n\nThe retriever results list CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] and CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] as top candidates.\nOther CWEs such as CWE-434 [Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type], CWE-89 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')], CWE-73 [External Control of File Name or Path] are not selected as they are not directly related to the **CSRF** leading to XSS in the given vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
