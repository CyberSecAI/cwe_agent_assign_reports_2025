  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-3980 Content\n\nBased on the provided content, this relates to a vulnerability in the \"Internet doctor workstation system\".\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is the lack of authorization checks on specific API endpoints.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The API endpoints `/ms-hoc-online-prescription/v1/prescription/list`, `/ms-hoc-online-prescription/v1/prescription/details/`, and `/ms-pocket-hospital/v1/pushConfig/detail/` are accessible without authentication.\n*   **Information Disclosure:**  Successful exploitation leads to the disclosure of sensitive user information.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAttackers can exploit this vulnerability to leak users' personal information, including:\n\n*   Names\n*   National ID numbers (\u8eab\u4efd\u8bc1\u4fe1\u606f)\n*   Phone numbers\n*   Medical condition details (\u60a3\u75c5\u60c5\u51b5)\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n1.  Access the `/ms-pocket-hospital/v1/pushConfig/detail/1` endpoint to obtain a `hospitalId` value.\n2.  Send a POST request to `/ms-hoc-online-prescription/v1/prescription/list` with the obtained `hospitalId` to retrieve `prescriptionId` values.\n3.  Use the `prescriptionId` to access `/ms-hoc-online-prescription/v1/prescription/details/{prescriptionId}` and retrieve sensitive user data.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   No specific privileges or authentication are required. An attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable endpoints.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not provide specific mitigation or fix details. However, implementing proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for these API endpoints is necessary to prevent unauthorized access and data leakage.\n\n**More detail than official CVE description:**\n\nYes, the content provides a detailed description of the vulnerability, including specific API endpoints, a step-by-step explanation of the attack vector, and the types of data that can be compromised. This is significantly more detailed than a typical CVE description.",

While CWE-284 is a broader category, the description provides enough information to narrow it down to CWE-285 which deals with authorization. Given the lack of authentication, CWE-306 is also considered as a contributing factor. The relationship between CWE-285 and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was also considered, but since the authorization mechanism is missing rather than incorrect, CWE-285 is preferred.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper authorization** (CWE-285) due to the **missing authentication** (CWE-306) which allows for **direct request** (CWE-425) to sensitive information, leading to information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed to CWE-285 due to the \"**improper authorization**\" vulnerability. The detailed analysis of the CVE reference links content summary provides strong evidence for this classification. The summary states, \"The root cause is the lack of authorization checks on specific API endpoints\" and \"The API endpoints ... are accessible without authentication.\" This confirms that the issue is related to authorization and authentication, reinforcing the choice of CWE-285. The retriever results also list CWE-285 and CWE-306 as relevant, supporting the initial assessment. The additional context provided in the authentication vs authorization vs access control guidance further strengthens the decision to classify this as CWE-285 primarily, but also acknowledges the role of CWE-306 due to the lack of authentication. The selection of CWE-285 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the core issue of **improper authorization**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
