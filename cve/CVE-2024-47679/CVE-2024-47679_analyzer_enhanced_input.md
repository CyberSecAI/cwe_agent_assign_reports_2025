## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved vfs fix race between evice_inodes() and find_inode()&iput() Hi, all Recently I noticed a bug[1] in btrfs, after digged it into and I believe ita race in vfs. Lets assume theres a inode (ie ino 261) with i_count 1 is called by iput(), and theres a concurrent thread calling generic_shutdown_super(). cpu0 cpu1 iput() // i_count is 1 ->spin_lock(inode) ->dec i_count to 0 ->iput_final() generic_shutdown_super() ->__inode_add_lru() ->evict_inodes() // cause some reason[2] ->if (atomic_read(inode->i_count)) continue // return before // inode 261 passed the above check // list_lru_add_obj() // and then schedule out ->spin_unlock() // note here the inode 261 // was still at sb list and hash list, // and I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE was not been set btrfs_iget() // after some function calls ->find_inode() // found the above inode 261 ->spin_lock(inode) // check I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE // and passed ->__iget() ->spin_unlock(inode) // schedule back ->spin_lock(inode) // check (I_NEW|I_FREEING|I_WILL_FREE) flags, // passed and set I_FREEING iput() ->spin_unlock(inode) ->spin_lock(inode) ->ev

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **race condition**
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** vfs

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a race condition in the Linux kernel's virtual file system (VFS) layer, specifically between the `evict_inodes()` function (which is called during superblock shutdown) and the combination of `find_inode()` and `iput()` functions when accessing an inode.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Race Condition:** A race exists when an inode's reference count (`i_count`) is decremented to zero by `iput()`, and concurrently, `evict_inodes()` is iterating through inodes for eviction. Due to the timing, `evict_inodes()` can skip an inode that is about to be freed, but not yet marked as such (I_FREEING, I_WILL_FREE). Subsequently, another thread using `find_inode()` might locate this inode, increment its `i_count`, and start using it, while the original `iput()` call is also continuing the eviction process, thus leading to a double eviction.
*  **Missing check after locking:**  The initial check in `evict_inodes()` to see if `i_count` is zero is done before acquiring the `i_lock`, this check is not atomic. Another thread could increment `i_count` after the initial check, but before the lock is acquired and the rest of eviction logic is executed.
*   **Double Eviction:** The primary vulnerability lies in the fact that two different threads can simultaneously start evicting the same inode, which leads to a race condition in inode management.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Kernel BUG:** This race condition can trigger a `BUG(inode->i_state & I_CLEAR)` statement within the `clear_inode()` and `iput()` functions. This results in a kernel panic and system crash.
*   **Data Corruption**:  While not explicitly stated in the provided content, it's plausible this double eviction could also lead to memory corruption issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Concurrent Operations:** The attack vector involves triggering concurrent operations on the same inode. This is achieved when an inode is being released (`iput()`), and concurrently, the superblock containing the inode is being shut down (`generic_shutdown_super()`), which in turn calls `evict_inodes()`.  The other required thread is via `btrfs_iget()`.
*   **File System Specific:** The bug was initially discovered in the btrfs file system, and a similar path exists for other file systems, so the attacker needs to be able to trigger operations on a file system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Arbitrary File System Operations**: An attacker needs the ability to perform operations that involve creating and destroying inodes, which can lead to the triggering of the race condition.  This could be a process creating, deleting or modifying files, and/or a process unmounting file systems.
*   **Timing Control**: While not necessarily direct timing control over threads, the attacker needs to have a means to make the race occur reliably.

**Additional Details**
The provided content includes the specific code fix which adds a check for  `atomic_read(&inode->i_count)` after acquiring the `i_lock` to prevent the race condition:
```c
spin_lock(&inode->i_lock);
if (atomic_read(&inode->i_count)) {
    spin_unlock(&inode->i_lock);
    continue;
}
```
This ensures that after the lock is acquired the reference count is checked again, and if the count is not zero, the eviction process will not be started for that inode.

The fix was applied to multiple kernel versions in stable branches.
