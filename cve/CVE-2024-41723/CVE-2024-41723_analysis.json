The **impact** of the vulnerability is clearly stated as \"information leak of user account names.\" The selected CWE, CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor), directly addresses this **impact**.\n\nCWE-200 is a Class-level CWE and is generally discouraged as a primary mapping due to its high level of abstraction.

The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section is \"UNRELATED\", which means no further details about the technical details of the vulnerability are available.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but deemed less suitable:\n\n*   CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption): While resource consumption might be a secondary effect, the primary **impact** is information disclosure.\n*   CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery): SSRF could potentially lead to information disclosure, but there is no explicit evidence to support this.\n*   CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) : Since there is not evidence of special elements and injection, this is not suitable.\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 is based on the direct **impact** of the vulnerability, as stated in the description.
