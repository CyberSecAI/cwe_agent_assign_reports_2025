## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-5074 Content

Based on the provided content, this relates to a **buffer overflow vulnerability in Freefloat FTP Server 1.0**. While a CVE description was requested, this content provides details beyond a standard CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a buffer overflow triggered by the `PROMPT` command. The server does not properly validate the length of the input provided with the `PROMPT` command, allowing an attacker to overwrite memory beyond the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The FTP server fails to validate the size of the input received via the `PROMPT` command.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows the attacker to overwrite the instruction pointer (EIP) and potentially execute arbitrary code on the target system. The provided exploit aims to gain a reverse shell.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via the FTP protocol.
*   **PROMPT Command:** The attack is initiated by sending a specially crafted `PROMPT` command to the FTP server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target FTP server on port 21.
*   **Exploit Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of the buffer overflow vulnerability and how to craft a payload to overwrite the EIP and execute code.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not provide information about a specific fix. However, the vulnerability can be mitigated by:

*   **Input Validation:** Implementing proper input validation to ensure that the length of the input received via the `PROMPT` command does not exceed the allocated buffer size.
*   **Safe String Handling:** Using safe string handling functions that prevent buffer overflows.
*   **Update/Patch:** Applying any available updates or patches for the Freefloat FTP Server.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Offset:** 244 bytes
*   **EIP overwrite:** 0x7C86467B (JMP ESP) - This indicates the attacker is attempting to redirect execution to a location where they have placed their shellcode.
*   **Bad Characters:** `\x00\x0a\x0d` - These characters are excluded from the payload to avoid issues during transmission or execution.
*   **Payload Generation:** The exploit uses `msfvenom` to generate a Perl-based shellcode for a reverse TCP connection.
*   **Target:** Windows XP SP3 English.
*   **Lhost:** 192.168.232.129
*   **Lport:** 4444

**Note:** This content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including the specific offset, EIP address, and payload generation details.
