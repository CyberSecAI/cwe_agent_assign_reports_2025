  "description": "A **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)** vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expressions susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input.",

There are no other significant hierarchical or chain relationships that are directly relevant in this case. The abstraction level of Base for CWE-1333 is appropriate as it provides a specific and actionable characterization of the weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe1333 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single point: the **inefficient regular expression** which leads directly to a denial-of-service condition due to excessive resource consumption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions a **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)** vulnerability. The description highlights the **inefficient regular expression** `/{{(.*?)}}/g` as the root cause, and the impact is that the server becomes unresponsive. This aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-1333, \"Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity,\" which describes a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also identifies a fix for **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)**.\n\nThe retriever results strongly suggest CWE-1333 as the top candidate, further reinforcing this conclusion. The other CWEs were considered but deemed less relevant as they address different aspects of software weaknesses (e.g., resource management, algorithmic complexity). CWE-1333 is at the optimal level of specificity because it pinpoints the exact cause of the vulnerability, which is an inefficient regular expression.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced
