  "description": "IrfanView DXF File Parsing **Memory Corruption** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a memory corruption condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24602.",

The vulnerability stems from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, making this a potential, although less specific, mapping.

CWE-787 and CWE-125 are more specific than CWE-119 and accurately describe the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe119 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe125,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** which leads to **memory corruption**, and finally results in the ability to execute arbitrary code.\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-20 Implemented Incorrectly)\n2.  **Weakness:** Memory Corruption (CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write)\n3.  **Impact:** Remote Code Execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) due to the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**. This leads to memory corruption and enables remote code execution.\n\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section explicitly states \"**rootcause:** **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**\" and \"**weakness:** **Memory Corruption**\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the root cause is the \"Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing DXF files, leading to a memory corruption condition.\"\n\nCWE-787 is selected because it accurately describes the memory corruption resulting from writing data outside the intended buffer. CWE-125 is considered as a potential secondary weakness if the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** leads to an out-of-bounds read. CWE-20 is a higher-level class that describes the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, but is less specific than CWE-787 or CWE-125.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity (Base).\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Technical Explanation:* The vulnerability description clearly mentions that the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** leads to a **memory corruption condition**. This condition allows an attacker to overwrite memory locations beyond the intended buffer, which directly aligns with the description of CWE-787.\n*Security Implications:* An out-of-bounds write can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.\n*Relationship Analysis:* CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Technical Explanation:* The **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** could also lead to reading data outside the intended buffer.\n*Security Implications:* An out-of-bounds read can lead to information disclosure or denial of service.\n*Relationship Analysis:* CWE-125 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Technical Explanation:* While possible, there's no explicit mention of uninitialized pointers in the provided vulnerability description. Therefore, this CWE is less likely to be the primary cause.\n*Security Implications:* Accessing an uninitialized pointer can lead to unpredictable behavior, including crashes or exploitable conditions.\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Technical Explanation:* The description focuses on memory corruption due to the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, rather than excessive memory allocation.\n*Security Implications:* Excessive memory allocation can lead to denial of service.\n\n## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Technical Explanation:* While an improper array index could lead to an out-of-bounds write, the description is more general and highlights the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** that leads to memory corruption.\n*Security Implications:* An invalid array index can lead to out-of-bounds access.\n\n## CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available. It also overlaps existing CWE entries and might be deprecated in the future.\n\n*Technical Explanation:* This is very similar to CWE-787, but CWE-787 is preferred due to the mapping guidance.\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs operations on",
