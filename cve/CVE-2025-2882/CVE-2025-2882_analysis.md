# Analysis for CVE-2025-2882

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-425 | Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-200, which is a class-level CWE. Although it is generally preferred to choose a base-level CWE, none of its children seem appropriate. CWE-425 is a child of CWE-288 and CWE-862, representing different authorization bypass scenarios. The relationships suggest that unauthorized access can lead to sensitive information exposure.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **publicly accessible phpinfo.php script**, which allows **unauthenticated attackers** to directly request and access the file (CWE-425). This leads to **Sensitive Information Exposure** (CWE-200) because the script contains potentially sensitive information.
  - The root cause is the existence of the publicly accessible `phpinfo.php` script.
  - The weakness is the exposure of sensitive information.
  - The impact is that unauthenticated attackers can view the sensitive information.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is **Sensitive Information Exposure** (CWE-200), as the `phpinfo.php` script is publicly accessible and reveals sensitive data. This aligns with the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions "Sensitive Information Exposure." The presence of the `phpinfo.php` script without adequate access controls allows unauthenticated attackers to view potentially sensitive information.

The initial retriever results suggested CWE-200 as the top candidate, which aligns with the description of the vulnerability.
CWE-425 (Direct Request) is considered as a secondary weakness, because the `phpinfo.php` script is directly accessible without proper authorization.

The decision is primarily based on the vulnerability description and the identified weakness, supported by the retriever results and relationship analysis.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.
