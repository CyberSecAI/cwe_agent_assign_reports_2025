# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-24968

## Vulnerability Description
reNgine is an automated reconnaissance framework for web applications. An **unrestricted project deletion** vulnerability allows attackers with specific roles, such as `penetration_tester` or `auditor` to delete all projects in the system. This can lead to a complete system takeover by redirecting the attacker to the onboarding page, where they can add or modify users, including Sys Admins, and configure critical settings like API keys and user preferences. This issue affects all versions up to and including 2.20. Users are advised to monitor the project for future releases which address this issue. There are no known workarounds.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **unrestricted project deletion**
- **product:** reNgine
- **impact:** delete all projects in the system, system takeover
- **attacker:** attackers with specific roles
- **version:** up to and including 2.20

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's an analysis of the provided content:

*   **Content relates to CVE-2025-24968:** Yes, the content explicitly mentions CVE-2025-24968.
*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is an unrestricted project deletion vulnerability. The system allows users with specific roles (e.g., penetration\_tester or auditor) to delete all projects without proper authorization. This leads to a system takeover because the system redirects to the onboarding page when no projects exist, allowing attackers to reconfigure the system.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Deletion of all projects in the system.
    *   Access to the onboarding page.
    *   Ability to reconfigure the system.
    *   Ability to add new users with elevated privileges (e.g., Sys Admin).
    *   Ability to change critical configurations.
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) using the install tools function in Tool Arsenal.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Sending repeated POST requests to `/delete/project/<id>` to brute-force project deletion.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Requires a user account with roles like `penetration_tester` or `auditor`.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** The content mentions the vulnerability exists in versions `< 2.2.0`, but does not provide a patch or mitigation.
*   **More detail than the official CVE description:** Yes, the content provides detailed information including the root cause, attack vector, impact, and affected versions.
