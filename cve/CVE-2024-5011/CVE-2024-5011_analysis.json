A large value provided in the request controls the number of iterations in a loop, leading to excessive CPU resource consumption and ultimately a denial of service.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n  - **Mechanism:** A loop controlled by user-supplied input.\n  - **Impact:** Denial of Service due to resource exhaustion.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-400 as the primary weakness due to the **uncontrolled resource consumption**. The vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mention this. The Retriever Results also listed CWE-400 as the top candidate. Further analysis led to the inclusion of CWE-770 and CWE-789 to provide a more detailed explanation of the vulnerability.\n\nThe choice of CWE-400 is supported by the vulnerability description key phrases, specifically \"**uncontrolled resource consumption**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further confirms this by stating \"Uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability due to a loop in the `CreateChart` function being controlled by a user-supplied `pieces` argument.\"\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision to include CWE-770 and CWE-789 as they are children of CWE-400 and provide more specific details about the resource allocation process.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an optimal level of specificity, providing a clear understanding of the root cause and the mechanism behind the vulnerability, and the potential impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not maintain or incorrectly maintains control over a resource throughout its lifetime of creation, use, and release.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is high-level when lower-level children are available.\n\n*Not Used:* This is too high level.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
