## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "CVE-2024-5011": {
    "root_cause": "The `TestController` endpoint in Progress Software Corporation WhatsUp Gold exposes a `Chart` action to unauthenticated users. This action takes an integer `pieces` argument which controls the number of iterations in a loop that creates chart data points.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability due to a loop in the `CreateChart` function being controlled by a user-supplied `pieces` argument."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a specially crafted HTTP request with a large value for the `pieces` parameter, resulting in significant CPU resource consumption and potentially blocking the functionality of the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An unauthenticated HTTP request to the vulnerable `TestController/Chart` endpoint, specifying a large number of pieces."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need authentication or any special access. They just need to send a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is located in the `Chart` action of the `TestController`, specifically the loop within the `CreateChart` function. The attacker can control the number of iterations of the loop, leading to resource exhaustion."
  }
}
