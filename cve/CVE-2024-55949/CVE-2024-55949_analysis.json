  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-55949\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a missing permissions check in the IAM import API. This lack of validation allowed a user to modify their own policy mapping by crafting a malicious `iam-info.zip` file and uploading it.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Missing Authorization Check:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper authorization checks when importing IAM data. This allowed a user to import an `iam-info.zip` file and effectively overwrite their existing permissions.\n- **Privilege Escalation:** This vulnerability enabled a user with limited privileges to escalate their privileges to `consoleAdmin` or other higher-level policies.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Privilege Escalation:** A user with basic permissions could gain administrative access, allowing them to perform actions that they were not authorized to do.\n- **Data Breach/Manipulation:** An attacker might gain access to sensitive data, delete or alter data, or disrupt the service.\n- **Compromise of the System:** By achieving administrative privileges, an attacker could take complete control of the MinIO instance.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Maliciously Crafted ZIP File:** An attacker would need to create a specially crafted `iam-info.zip` file that includes a modified `user_mappings.json` file to change their policy mappings.\n- **`mc admin cluster iam import` API:** The attacker would use the `mc admin cluster iam import` command to upload the crafted ZIP file.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Existing MinIO User:** The attacker needs to be a valid user on the MinIO system. Anonymous users are not able to perform this attack.\n- **Access to `mc` client:** The attacker needs to have access to the `mc` (MinIO Client) command-line tool to be able to perform the import.\n- **Network Access:**  The attacker must have network access to the MinIO server.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- The vulnerability is present since the introduction of the IAM import API, specifically introduced by commit `580d9db85e04f1b63cc2909af50f0ed08afa965f` on June 23, 2022.\n- The vulnerability is fixed in commit `f246c9053f9603e610d98439799bdd2a6b293427`, part of pull request #20756.\n- The fix introduces an authorization check using `globalIAMSys.IsAllowed` before importing the IAM data.\n- The vulnerable API endpoints are `/minio/admin/v2/import-iam` and `/minio/admin/v3/import-iam-v2`.\n\n**Mitigation:**\n- **Upgrade:** Upgrade MinIO to version `RELEASE.2024-12-13T22-19-12Z` or later.\n- **Temporary Block API Calls:** If an immediate upgrade is not possible, temporarily block external access to the vulnerable API endpoints through a firewall or load balancer.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- This vulnerability is considered critical.\n- Credit for reporting this issue is given to the National Security Agency.\n\nThe provided content gives a good level of technical details and provides clear steps to reproduce and fix the issue.",

Since the vulnerability stems from a complete lack of authorization, CWE-862 is a more precise fit. CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) was also considered due to the privilege escalation impact, but the root cause is the missing authorization, making it a secondary concern.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe266,cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing authorization** in the IAM import API (CWE-862). This leads to a user being able to upload a malicious `iam-info.zip` file. The user then escalates their privileges (CWE-266 is a secondary candidate because it describes the consequence). The final impact is potential data breach or system compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference. The key piece of evidence is the statement that the vulnerability stems from a **missing permissions check** in the IAM import API. This directly points to CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). The retriever results also included CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), but these imply that an authorization check exists but is flawed, which is not the case here.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision by highlighting the parent-child relationship between CWE-862 and CWE-285.

It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\nCWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is the primary CWE because the vulnerability is caused by the **complete absence of an authorization check**, allowing users to perform actions they should not be able to.\nCWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) is a secondary candidate because it relates to the **impact** of the vulnerability, which is privilege escalation.\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization) was considered, but it's a less precise fit as it describes scenarios where an authorization check exists but is flawed.",
