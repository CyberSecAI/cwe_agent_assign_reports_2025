An attacker exploits this by injecting arbitrary web scripts into pages, which execute when a user accesses the injected page.\n- **Root Cause:** **Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**\n- **Weakness:** **CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]**\n- **Impact:** Arbitrary web script injection and execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is **CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]** because the vulnerability description clearly states that there is **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts. This aligns perfectly with the definition of **CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]**. The evidence is strong, as indicated by the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary.\n\nThe retriever results also support this selection, with **CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]** being a top result. The relationship analysis confirms that **CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]** is the appropriate level of abstraction, as it is a Base CWE. **CWE-80 [Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)]** is a more specific Variant, but the description doesn't limit the vulnerability to just script-related tags.\n\n**CWE-116 [Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output]** was also considered, as output escaping is part of the root cause.
