  "description": "A security issue was discovered in ingress-nginx https//github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx where the `mirror-target` and `mirror-host` Ingress annotations can be used to inject arbitrary configuration into nginx. This can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the ingress-nginx controller, and disclosure of Secrets accessible to the controller. (Note that in the default installation, the controller can access all Secrets cluster-wide.)",

It provides detailed information about a vulnerability in the ingress-nginx controller.\n\nHere's an extraction of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe `mirror-target` and `mirror-host` Ingress annotations can be used to inject arbitrary configuration into nginx.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Configuration injection\n*   Arbitrary code execution (potential)\n*   Secret disclosure (potential)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Arbitrary code execution in the context of the ingress-nginx controller.\n*   Disclosure of Secrets accessible to the controller (potentially all cluster Secrets in a default installation).\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Exploitation through unsanitized `mirror-target` or `mirror-host` annotations in Ingress resources.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Low privilege - requires the ability to create or modify Ingress resources.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **ACTION REQUIRED:** Upgrade ingress-nginx to v1.11.5, v1.12.1, or any later version.\n*   Fixed Versions: ingress-nginx [main@2e9f373](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/13068/commits/2e9f37380afb7853fa6daa1c3e6659550aadfd90)\n*   Upgrading instructions: [https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/upgrade/](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/upgrade/)\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **CVSS Rating:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (Score: 8.8, High)\n*   **Affected Versions:** < v1.11.0, v1.11.0 - 1.11.4, v1.12.0\n*   **Detection:** Suspicious data within the `mirror-target` or `mirror-host` annotations of an Ingress resource.\n*   **Acknowledgements:**  The vulnerability was reported by Nir Ohfeld, Ronen Shustin, Sagi Tzadik and Hillai Ben Sasson from Wiz.

CWE-20 is chosen as a Class, since it is more general, and the specific type of input validation issue isn't detailed enough to assign a Base or Variant CWE. CWE-732 is related to authorization issues, and is a candidate since the **injection** leads to potential unauthorized access of Secrets.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe732 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **improper input validation** (CWE-20) of the `mirror-target` and `mirror-host` Ingress annotations. This leads to the ability to **inject arbitrary configuration** into nginx. The injected configuration can then lead to arbitrary code execution and the disclosure of Secrets. The **incorrect permission assignment** (CWE-732) could be the condition that allows the access of Secrets.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the ability to inject arbitrary configuration via the `mirror-target` and `mirror-host` annotations. The final conclusion is that the root cause is **improper input validation** (CWE-20), since that is what allows the injection to occur in the first place.\n\nThe evidence for this is: \"the `mirror-target` and `mirror-host` Ingress annotations can be used to inject arbitrary configuration into nginx\". The **injection** itself is a consequence of the **lack of proper validation**.\n\nThe relationship analysis shows that a more specific CWE might be possible if more information about the input validation was available. The retriever results also show candidates related to authorization.\n\nCWE-20 is chosen as the optimal level of specificity because the vulnerability description identifies the general lack of input validation as the root cause. The retriever results also suggest several CWEs related to authorization, such as CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
