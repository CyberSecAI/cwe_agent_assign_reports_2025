  "description": "Nextcloud Server is a self hosted personal cloud system. The OAuth2 client secrets were stored in a recoverable way, so that an attacker that got access to a backup of the database and the Nextcloud config file, would be able to decrypt them. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 28.0.10 or 29.0.7 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 27.1.11.8, 28.0.10 or 29.0.7.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-52519:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n- The OAuth2 client secrets were stored in an encrypted format that was reversible. An attacker gaining access to the database and Nextcloud configuration file could decrypt these secrets.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data:**  Instead of storing a hash of the secret, the application was storing the encrypted secret. This meant that with access to the encryption key, the secrets could be decrypted and recovered.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker who obtains a database backup and the Nextcloud config file can decrypt stored OAuth2 client secrets.\n- **Potential Further Attacks:** Recovered secrets could be used to impersonate applications using OAuth2 to access Nextcloud data.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Physical Access to Backups:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker gaining access to backups of the Nextcloud database and the Nextcloud configuration files. This would require access to the server or storage medium.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Access to Database Backup:** The attacker must be able to access a backup of the Nextcloud database.\n- **Access to Nextcloud Configuration:** The attacker must have access to the Nextcloud config file, which contains the encryption key needed for decryption.\n- **High Privileges Required:** The attacker would likely need high privileges to access the database backups and configuration file on the server.\n- **User Interaction Required:** The attack requires the user to generate the database backup.\n\n**Additional Details from the Content:**\n\n- **Mitigation:** The fix involves storing a hash of the client secret rather than encrypting it. This makes the secret non-recoverable, thus mitigating the vulnerability.\n- **Affected Versions:** Nextcloud Server versions >= 28.0.0 and >= 29.0.0, and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions >= 27.0.0, >= 28.0.0, and >= 29.0.0 were affected.\n- **Patched Versions:** Patched versions are 28.0.10 and 29.0.7 for Nextcloud Server, and 27.1.11.8, 28.0.10, and 29.0.7 for Nextcloud Enterprise Server.\n- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability was given a CVSS v3 base score of 2.7, with vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N.\n- **CWE:**  The vulnerability is associated with CWE-922 which refers to Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data.\n- **Pull Request:** The fix was implemented in pull request #47635 on the Nextcloud server repository.\n\nIn summary, this vulnerability stems from storing OAuth2 client secrets in a reversibly encrypted way, which could lead to a confidentiality breach if an attacker gained access to the database backups and config file. The fix replaces this with hashing the secrets, making them non-recoverable.",

CWE-312 and CWE-256 are potential specializations. Because the vulnerability involves reversibly encrypted data, CWE-312 is considered, but the specific encryption details are unknown which makes CWE-922 a more general and fitting choice. CWE-256 is a child of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), indicating a focus on password storage. However, the vulnerability relates to OAuth2 client secrets more broadly, not specifically passwords. The abstraction levels are appropriate as Base CWEs are preferred.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe922[\"CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe922\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe522 -->|CHILDOF| cwe922\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe922 primary\n    class cwe312,cwe256 secondary\n    class cwe522 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insecure storage** of the OAuth2 client secrets, leading to potential decryption and unauthorized access to the Nextcloud data:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data - OAuth2 client secrets are stored in a recoverable way.\n2.  Impact: An attacker with access to the database backup and Nextcloud config file can decrypt the secrets, leading to a confidentiality breach.\n3.  Final Impact: Recovered secrets could be used to impersonate applications, gaining unauthorized access to Nextcloud data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **weakness** of storing OAuth2 client secrets in a recoverable way. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions that the vulnerability is associated with CWE-922 (Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data). This, along with the description of the root cause as storing encrypted secrets that can be decrypted, strongly supports the selection of CWE-922 as the primary CWE.\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that more specific CWEs like CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) and CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) exist, but they are not as accurate as CWE-922, which covers the general case of **insecure storage**. The mitigation of hashing the secrets further validates that the original storage method was the core issue. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity as they accurately represent the root cause without being overly specific or narrow in scope.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   **CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data:** This CWE is the primary candidate because it directly addresses the **root cause** identified in the vulnerability description. The **OAuth2 client secrets** were stored in a manner that allowed for recovery if an attacker gained access to the database backup and configuration file. The vulnerability description key phrases explicitly mentions the **weakness** of \"OAuth2 client secrets stored in a recoverable way\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the vulnerability is associated with CWE-922.\n*   **CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** This CWE was considered because the secrets were stored in an encrypted format but were decryptable. However, since the primary issue is the lack of proper protection during storage, not necessarily the storage in cleartext, CWE-922 is more appropriate.\n*   **CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password:** This CWE was considered because secrets can be considered passwords. However, OAuth2 client secrets are not strictly passwords, so it doesn't fit perfectly.",
