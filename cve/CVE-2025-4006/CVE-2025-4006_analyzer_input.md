*   **Relevance:** The content directly relates to CVE-2025-4006.
*   **Extraction:**

    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Two file upload vulnerabilities exist in BeyongCms 1.6.0.
        *   The first vulnerability is in the admin/controller/Theme upload method. An attacker can upload a zip file containing a malicious PHP file via the document management section after logging into the backend. The file is then extracted based on a file ID. An attacker can exploit this by crafting a request to the /admin/theme/upload.html endpoint with a known or bruteforced fileId, leading to arbitrary file upload and remote code execution (RCE).
        *   The second vulnerability is in the common/controller/File upload method, utilizing the ThinkPHP native file upload function. While file extensions are restricted, the `exts` parameter in the request allows an attacker to specify the allowed file extensions, bypassing the original restrictions. An attacker can upload a file with an extension like `.html` by setting the `exts` parameter to html via a POST request. If the server supports parsing of the uploaded extension, this can lead to remote code execution (RCE).
    *   **Impact of exploitation:** Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   **Attack vectors:**
        *   Exploiting the admin/controller/Theme upload method involves uploading a malicious ZIP file containing a PHP file and then sending a crafted GET request to the `/admin/theme/upload.html` endpoint.
        *   Exploiting the common/controller/File upload method involves crafting a POST request to the /admin/file/upload.html endpoint, including the `exts` parameter, to specify a desired file extension like HTML.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires administrative access to the BeyongCms backend in the first vulnerability and the ability to make POST requests in the second one.
    *   **Mitigation or fix:** The content does not mention mitigations or fixes.
    *   **More detail than the official CVE description:** This content offers significantly more detail, including the specific file upload locations, code snippets, and attack request examples to exploit the described vulnerabilities.
