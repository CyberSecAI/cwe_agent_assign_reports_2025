  "description": "Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. Starting in version 1.11.4 and prior to versions 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3, it is possible to **bypass authorization checks** within a Next.js application, if the authorization check occurs in middleware. If patching to a safe version is infeasible, it is recommend that you prevent external user requests which contain the x-middleware-subrequest header from reaching your Next.js application. This vulnerability is fixed in 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3.",

While CWE-285 is a broader category, the provided information suggests a problem with how authorization is handled, but not necessarily a complete lack of authorization, making CWE-862 and CWE-863 potential candidates.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe862,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper authorization** in the Next.js middleware, leading to the ability to **bypass authorization checks**.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Improper Authorization** (CWE-285).\n  - **Weakness/Impact:** Ability to **bypass authorization checks**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference links, points towards an authorization issue within the Next.js middleware. The description explicitly mentions the ability to \"**bypass authorization checks**,\" which strongly suggests a problem with how authorization is implemented. The provided evidence from the CVE reference links content summary consistently identifies \"**Authorization bypass (CWE-285)**\" as the weakness.\n\nThe retriever results also support this assessment, with CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) being a relevant candidate. However, the retriever results also list CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), which are more specific variants of CWE-285. Given that the vulnerability description states \"**bypass authorization checks**,\" it's possible that the authorization checks are either incorrect (CWE-863) or completely missing in certain scenarios (CWE-862).\n\nThe CWE Classification Guidance further clarifies the distinction between authentication and authorization, emphasizing that if the issue involves improper or missing role checks, CWE-285 is appropriate. The guidance also advises against using CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) if a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, or 863 is applicable.\n\nBased on the evidence and guidance, CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is the most appropriate primary CWE, as it captures the general authorization flaw. However, CWE-863 and CWE-862 are also considered as secondary candidates, depending on the specific implementation details of the authorization checks in the Next.js middleware.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they directly address the authorization issues described in the vulnerability. More generic CWEs like CWE-284 would not provide sufficient detail, while more specific variants might not be applicable to all scenarios.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names.

The description does not provide sufficient evidence to confirm this specific mechanism.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n*   **Not Used:** This CWE is too general and does not provide specific information about the authorization bypass.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*   **Not Used:** This CWE is not related to authorization bypass issues.\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*   **Not Used:** This CWE is not related to authorization bypass issues.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*   **Not Used:** This CWE is not related to authorization bypass issues.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**",
