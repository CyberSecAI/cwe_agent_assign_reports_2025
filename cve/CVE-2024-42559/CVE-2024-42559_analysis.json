CWE-1390 is a Class level CWE and a parent of CWE-306, but CWE-306 is more specific to the vulnerability description. There are no chain relationships that appear to influence the selection of CWE-306.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1390\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe1390 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of weaknesses begins with the **missing authentication** (CWE-306) for a critical function, which allows an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and authenticate without a valid password. This leads to unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed towards several CWEs related to authentication issues, but the retriever results highlighted CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) as potential candidates. The vulnerability description states that attackers can **authenticate without providing a valid password**, which strongly suggests that a critical function lacks proper authentication.\n\nCWE-306 is a Base level CWE, and its description aligns well with the vulnerability: \"The product does not adequately authenticate users before allowing access to a critical function.\" This is a more precise description than CWE-1390, which is a broader Class level CWE. Therefore, CWE-306 is chosen as the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is **incorrect**.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*   Rejected: While related to authentication, the description focuses on an **incorrect** implementation, while the provided text emphasizes a **missing** authentication for the critical function.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses **weak credentials** (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*   Rejected: This CWE focuses on the use of weak credentials, whereas the provided text discusses the ability to bypass the authentication process entirely.\n\n## CWE-620: Unverified Password Change\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nWhen setting a new password for a user, the product does not require knowledge of the original password, or using another form of authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*   Rejected: The provided text does not discuss password change, so this CWE is not appropriate.\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*   Rejected: The provided text does not provide specific details about an alternate path or channel being used to bypass authentication.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*   Rejected: The vulnerability description doesn't involve external control of parameters.\n\n## CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not implement sufficient measures to prevent multiple failed authentication attempts within a short time frame.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*   Rejected: The vulnerability is not related to excessive authentication attempts.\n\n## CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication algorithm is sound, but the implemented mechanism can be bypassed as the result of a separate weakness that is primary to the authentication error.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*   Rejected: The provided text focuses on **missing** authentication, which is the primary weakness.
