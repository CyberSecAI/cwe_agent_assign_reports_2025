# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-10141

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in jsbroks COCO Annotator 0.11.1. This affects an unknown part of the component Session Handler. The manipulation of the argument SECRET_KEY leads to predictable from observable state. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** predictable from observable state
- **vector:** manipulation of SECRET_KEY argument
- **product:** jsbroks COCO Annotator
- **version:** 0.11.1
- **component:** Session Handler

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The `coco-annotator` project uses a default, hardcoded `SECRET_KEY` for signing and verifying Flask sessions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Predictable Secret Key:** The use of a default `SECRET_KEY` makes it possible for attackers to predict the key used for session management.
* **Session Forgery:** With the predictable `SECRET_KEY`, an attacker can forge session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to the application.
* **Insecure User ID Generation:** User IDs are generated using MongoDB's ObjectId, which contains a predictable timestamp component that can be brute-forced, especially if combined with a fixed machine and process identifier.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Privilege Escalation:** By forging a session cookie, an attacker can gain administrative privileges.
* **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can impersonate any user, including the administrator.
* **Data Manipulation:** Once authenticated, the attacker can access and manipulate data within the application as an administrator.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Network Access:** The attack is performed through network requests to the application.
* **Cookie Manipulation:** Attackers generate and inject forged session cookies.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable `coco-annotator` instance.
* **Basic Understanding of Web Requests:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft HTTP requests, including setting cookies.
* **Tooling:** The attacker utilizes `flask-session-cookie-manager` tool and a web request interceptor (like Burp Suite) to decode/encode and inject the forged session cookie.
* **Knowledge of ObjectId Structure:** The attacker needs to understand the structure of MongoDB ObjectIds to predict user IDs.
* **Brute-forcing Capability:** The attacker uses a script to brute-force the time component of ObjectIds.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The issue was found in `coco-annotator` version `v0.11.1`.
*   The attacker can use a tool like `flask-session-cookie-manager` to decode the session cookie and generate their own.
*   The user ID is derived from MongoDB's ObjectId, which contains a timestamp that can be brute-forced within a reasonable range (a day or a year).
*   The exploit steps include registering a user, decoding the session, analyzing the structure of the user ID, brute-forcing the timestamp part of the user ID and finally forging the session and sending a request to gain administrative privileges.
*   A python script is provided for brute forcing and generating forged sessions.
*   The session `_id` field is not meaningful and can be freely modified.
*   The first registered user is a super administrator.
*   The vulnerability was reported to GitHub as issue #626 and assigned CVE-2024-10141.
