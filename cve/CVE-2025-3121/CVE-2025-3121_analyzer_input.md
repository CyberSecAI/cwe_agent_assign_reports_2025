## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content describes a segmentation fault occurring in PyTorch when loading a JIT module from a flatbuffer file.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a segmentation fault triggered when executing `torch.jit.jit_module_from_flatbuffer('model.ff')` after saving a scripted model to a flatbuffer file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A bug in the `torch.jit.jit_module_from_flatbuffer` function or related code path.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Application crash (segmentation fault).

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious or crafted flatbuffer file could potentially trigger the segmentation fault.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to provide a flatbuffer file to the application. This could be through a file upload, network connection, or other means of data input.

**Mitigation or fix:**
- No mitigation or fix is provided in the content. The issue is reported and assigned to the JIT oncall triage queue for investigation.
