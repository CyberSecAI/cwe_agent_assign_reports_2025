  "description": "The Versa Concerto SD-WAN orchestration platform is vulnerable to an **authentication bypass** in the Traefik reverse proxy configuration, allowing at attacker to access administrative endpoints. The Spack upload endpoint can be leveraged for a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) write in combination with a **race condition** to achieve remote code execution via path loading manipulation, allowing an unauthenticated actor to achieve remote code execution (RCE).This issue is known to affect Concerto from 12.1.2 through 12.2.0. Additional versions may be vulnerable.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-34027 based on provided content\n\nThe provided content **is relevant** to CVE-2025-34027. The blog post from projectdiscovery.io details multiple vulnerabilities found in Versa Concerto, and specifically mentions CVE-2025-34027 as one of them. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   Inconsistency in URL processing: The application URL decodes the request URI during authentication checks but processes it without decoding for controller logic. This creates a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) issue.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Authentication bypass due to URL decoding inconsistency.\n*   Arbitrary file write vulnerability in `/portalapi/v1/package/spack/upload` endpoint.\n*   Race condition allowing Remote Code Execution (RCE) by exploiting the file write vulnerability and a health check cron job.\n*   Actuator endpoint authentication bypass due to improper handling of the `X-Real-Ip` header and a vulnerability in Traefik (GHSA-62c8-mh53-4cqv) allowing header manipulation.\n*   Docker container escape due to misconfigured volume mappings.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Full compromise of the application and underlying host system.\n*   Unauthorized access to sensitive network configurations and enterprise data.\n*   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the system.\n*   Information Leak via Actuator endpoints.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Crafting malicious URLs with encoded characters to bypass authentication.\n*   Uploading malicious files via the `/portalapi/v1/package/spack/upload` endpoint.\n*   Exploiting the race condition between file upload and health check execution.\n*   Manipulating the `X-Real-Ip` header to bypass Actuator endpoint authentication.\n*   Overwriting system binaries within the Docker container to escape.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Network access to the Versa Concerto instance.\n*   Ability to craft HTTP requests.\n*   Understanding of URL encoding and decoding.\n*   Knowledge of Docker and containerization concepts (for container escape).\n*   Ability to compile and upload a reverse shell (for RCE).\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Block semicolons in URL paths:** Implement a rule to block requests containing semicolons in the URL.\n*   **Drop requests with specific Connection headers:** Configure reverse proxy/WAF to drop requests with `Connection: X-Real-Ip`.\n*   Versa released hot fixes for the reported issues:\n    *   CVE-2025-34025 Patch\n    *   CVE-2025-34026 Patch\n    *   CVE-2025-34027 Patch\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\nThe blog post provides significantly more detail than the CVE description placeholder. It details the specific code snippets involved, the steps taken to exploit the vulnerabilities, and the tools used (e.g., LD\\_PRELOAD).  It also provides Nuclei templates for detection.\n\nThe vulncheck.com content confirms the CVE assignment and provides a link to the official CVE record.",

CWE-367 is a more specific version of CWE-362, but the description doesn't contain the time-of-check time-of-use details, so the more general CWE-362 seems like a better fit.\nCWE-287 is included as a secondary weakness because the description mentions an **authentication bypass**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n\n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe287 secondary\n    class cwe367 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **authentication bypass**, allowing an attacker to reach the Spack upload endpoint. This endpoint is then vulnerable to a **TOCTOU race condition**. Successful exploitation allows remote code execution.\n**Authentication bypass** -> **Race condition** -> Remote Code Execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **authentication bypass** and the **race condition** as the main weaknesses. The retriever results also highlighted relevant CWEs such as CWE-306 (Missing Authentication) and CWE-367 (TOCTOU Race Condition). However, after considering the complete context, including the description of the vulnerability, the retriever results, and the mapping guidance, CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) was chosen as the primary CWE to address the **race condition** aspect, and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) as a secondary CWE to capture the **authentication bypass** aspect.\n\nThe choice of CWE-362 is based on the description of the **race condition** that allows an unauthenticated actor to achieve remote code execution. The CVE reference confirms this, stating \"Race condition allowing Remote Code Execution (RCE) by exploiting the file write vulnerability and a health check cron job.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-287 is based on the **authentication bypass** vulnerability. The CVE reference indicates that \"Authentication bypass due to URL decoding inconsistency\" and \"Actuator endpoint authentication bypass due to improper handling of the `X-Real-Ip` header and a vulnerability in Traefik\". This indicates an **authentication bypass** is occurring in conjunction with the **race condition**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the weaknesses described in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
