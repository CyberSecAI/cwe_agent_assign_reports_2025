  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-3180 Content\n\nThis content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it's not directly tied to a CVE with ID CVE-2025-3180 as the CVE description is a placeholder. It details a SQL injection vulnerability in \"Online Doctor Appointment Booking System PHP and Mysql\" project version V1.0.  It provides more detail than a typical CVE description.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the 'id' parameter in the `/doctor/deleteschedule.php` file.  Malicious code injected into this parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering\n*   Comprehensive system control\n*   Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The `/doctor/deleteschedule.php` file is vulnerable via the 'id' parameter (POST request).\n*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the `/doctor/deleteschedule.php` endpoint. No authentication is required.\n*   Knowledge of SQL injection techniques and potentially tools like `sqlmap`.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:**  Separate SQL code from user input data.\n2.  **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.\n3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the minimum necessary permissions.\n4.  **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.\n\n**Payload Example:**\n\n```\n---\nParameter: id (POST)\n    Type: time-based blind\n    Title: MySQL < 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (BENCHMARK)\n    Payload: id=1 AND 4922=BENCHMARK(5000000,MD5(0x426c7243))\n---\n```\n\n**Software Link:**\n\n*   <https://projectworlds.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/PHP-Doctor-Appointment-System.zip>\n\n**Vendor Homepage:**\n\n*   <https://projectworlds.in/free-projects/php-projects/online-doctor-appointment-booking-system-php-and-mysql/>",

The vulnerability description and extracted data indicate that the root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization, leading to SQL Injection. There are no child elements or parent relationships that would change this mapping.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper neutralization** of special elements in SQL commands (CWE-89).\n2.  **Impact:** SQL Injection, leading to unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, system control, or service interruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence. The key phrase \"sql injection\" in the vulnerability description and the detailed breakdown in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, especially the mention of \"insufficient user input validation of the 'id' parameter\" and \"malicious code injected into this parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation,\" strongly support the selection of CWE-89. The provided mitigation strategies (prepared statements, input validation) also align perfectly with preventing SQL Injection.\n\nThe retriever results further reinforce this decision, with CWE-89 having the highest score. Given the specific nature of the vulnerability and the strong supporting evidence, CWE-89 is the most appropriate and specific classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
