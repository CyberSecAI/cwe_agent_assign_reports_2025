## Analysis of CVE-2025-3180 Content

This content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it's not directly tied to a CVE with ID CVE-2025-3180 as the CVE description is a placeholder. It details a SQL injection vulnerability in "Online Doctor Appointment Booking System PHP and Mysql" project version V1.0.  It provides more detail than a typical CVE description.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the 'id' parameter in the `/doctor/deleteschedule.php` file.  Malicious code injected into this parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   Comprehensive system control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The `/doctor/deleteschedule.php` file is vulnerable via the 'id' parameter (POST request).
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the `/doctor/deleteschedule.php` endpoint. No authentication is required.
*   Knowledge of SQL injection techniques and potentially tools like `sqlmap`.

**Mitigation or fix:**

1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:**  Separate SQL code from user input data.
2.  **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.
3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the minimum necessary permissions.
4.  **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.

**Payload Example:**

```

Parameter: id (POST)
    Type: time-based blind
    Title: MySQL < 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (BENCHMARK)
    Payload: id=1 AND 4922=BENCHMARK(5000000,MD5(0x426c7243))
