# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-39361
## Query
Mattermost versions 9.8.0, 9.7.x <= 9.7.4, 9.6.x <= 9.6.2 and 9.5.x <= 9.5.5 fail to prevent users from specifying a RemoteId for their posts which allows an attacker to specify both a remoteId and the post ID, resulting in creating a post with a user-defined post ID. This can cause some broken functionality in the channel or thread with user-defined posts

## Keyphrases
- **weakness**: 'fail to prevent users from specifying a RemoteId for their posts'
