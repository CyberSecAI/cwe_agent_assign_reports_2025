### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** 1000 Projects Bookstore Management System
- **version:** 1
- **component:** /forget_password_process.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the `forget_password_process.php` file of the Bookstore Management System. The application directly uses the 'unm' parameter from user input in SQL queries without sanitizing it, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection in the `forget_password_process.php` file, specifically through the `unm` parameter. This allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate or sanitize the user-provided input, allowing malicious code to be injected into the SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers could modify or delete data within the database.
- **System Control:** Attackers could achieve comprehensive system control.
- **Service Interruption:** Attackers may be able to disrupt services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `unm` parameter in a POST request to the `forget_password_process.php` file.
- No prior authentication or authorization is needed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the `forget_password_process.php` file.
- They don't need to be logged in or have any prior authorization.
- They need knowledge of SQL injection techniques.

**Technical Details**
- Vulnerability Type: Time-based blind SQL injection
- Vulnerable parameter: `unm` (POST)
- Payload example (time-based blind):
   ```
   unm=1111' AND (SELECT 3819 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))nmGA)-- dupg&question=Which is your Favourite Movie ?&answer=1111&pwd=1111&cpwd=1111
   ```
- The provided sqlmap command further demonstrates the vulnerability:
   ```
    sqlmap -u "http://10.211.55.6:1111/forget_password_process.php" --data="unm=1111&question=Which+is+your+Favourite+Movie+%3F&answer=1111&pwd=1111&cpwd=1111" --method=POST --level=5 --risk=3 --batch --dbs --random-agent
    ```

**Suggested Remediation:**
- **Prepared Statements and Parameter Binding:** Use prepared statements to separate SQL code from user-provided data.
- **Input Validation and Filtering:**  Implement strict validation and filtering of user inputs.
- **Least Privilege Principle:**  Database connection should have minimal permissions.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities promptly.
