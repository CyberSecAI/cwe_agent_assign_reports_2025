  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi ufs core Fix use-after free in init error and remove paths devm_blk_crypto_profile_init() registers a cleanup handler to run when the associated (platform-) device is being released. For UFS, the crypto private data and pointers are stored as part of the ufs_hbas data structure struct ufs_hbacrypto_profile. This structure is allocated as part of the underlying ufshcd and therefore Scsi_host allocation. During driver release or during error handling in ufshcd_pltfrm_init(), this structure is released as part of ufshcd_dealloc_host() before the (platform-) device associated with the crypto call above is released. Once this device is released, the crypto cleanup code will run, using the just-released struct ufs_hbacrypto_profile. This causes a ****use-after-free** situation** Call trace kfree+0x60/0x2d8 (P) kvfree+0x44/0x60 blk_crypto_profile_destroy_callback+0x28/0x70 devm_action_release+0x1c/0x30 release_nodes+0x6c/0x108 devres_release_all+0x98/0x100 device_unbind_cleanup+0x20/0x70 really_probe+0x218/0x2d0 In other words, the initialisation code flow is platform-device probe ufshcd_pltfrm_init() ufshcd_alloc_host() scsi_host_alloc() allocation of struct ufs_hba creation of scsi-host devices devm_blk_crypto_profile_init() devm registration of cleanup handler using platform-device and during error handling of ufshcd_pltfrm_init() or during driver removal ufshcd_dealloc_host() scsi_host_put() put_device(scsi-host) release of struct ufs_hba put_device(platform-device) crypto cleanup handler To fix this use-after free, change ufshcd_alloc_host() to register a devres action to automatically cleanup the underlying SCSI device on ufshcd destruction, without requiring explicit calls to ufshcd_dealloc_host(). This way * the crypto profile and all other ufs_hba-owned resources are destroyed before SCSI (as theyve been registered after) * a memleak is plugged in tc-dwc-g210-pci.c remove() as a side-effect * EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(ufshcd_dealloc_host) can be removed fully as its not needed anymore * no future drivers using ufshcd_alloc_host() could ever forget adding the cleanup",

The other CWEs listed in the Retriever Results may be related in other contexts, but are not direct matches for this vulnerability. CWE-416 is a Variant level CWE, which provides the appropriate level of detail for this vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe416 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  Improper resource management leads to a **use-after-free** condition.\n2.  The **use-after-free** condition allows an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a **use-after-free situation** occurs in the Linux kernel's scsi ufs core. The **use-after-free** happens when the crypto cleanup code runs, using the released `struct ufs_hbacrypto_profile`.\n\nThe primary CWE, CWE-416 **Use After Free**, directly matches the vulnerability description and key phrases. The retriever results also list CWE-416 as the top candidate.\n\nOther CWEs such as **CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')**, **CWE-415 Double Free**, **CWE-908 Use of Uninitialized Resource**, and **CWE-909 Missing Initialization of Resource** are not applicable because the vulnerability is a straightforward **use-after-free** and not a race condition, double free, use of uninitialized resource or missing initialization of resource.\n\nThe final decision is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the retriever results. The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, as it is a Variant level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially
