# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-21739

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi ufs core Fix use-after free in init error and remove paths devm_blk_crypto_profile_init() registers a cleanup handler to run when the associated (platform-) device is being released. For UFS, the crypto private data and pointers are stored as part of the ufs_hbas data structure struct ufs_hbacrypto_profile. This structure is allocated as part of the underlying ufshcd and therefore Scsi_host allocation. During driver release or during error handling in ufshcd_pltfrm_init(), this structure is released as part of ufshcd_dealloc_host() before the (platform-) device associated with the crypto call above is released. Once this device is released, the crypto cleanup code will run, using the just-released struct ufs_hbacrypto_profile. This causes a ****use-after-free** situation** Call trace kfree+0x60/0x2d8 (P) kvfree+0x44/0x60 blk_crypto_profile_destroy_callback+0x28/0x70 devm_action_release+0x1c/0x30 release_nodes+0x6c/0x108 devres_release_all+0x98/0x100 device_unbind_cleanup+0x20/0x70 really_probe+0x218/0x2d0 In other words, the initialisation code flow is platform-device probe ufshcd_pltfrm_init() ufshcd_alloc_host() scsi_host_alloc() allocation of struct ufs_hba creation of scsi-host devices devm_blk_crypto_profile_init() devm registration of cleanup handler using platform-device and during error handling of ufshcd_pltfrm_init() or during driver removal ufshcd_dealloc_host() scsi_host_put() put_device(scsi-host) release of struct ufs_hba put_device(platform-device) crypto cleanup handler To fix this use-after free, change ufshcd_alloc_host() to register a devres action to automatically cleanup the underlying SCSI device on ufshcd destruction, without requiring explicit calls to ufshcd_dealloc_host(). This way * the crypto profile and all other ufs_hba-owned resources are destroyed before SCSI (as theyve been registered after) * a memleak is plugged in tc-dwc-g210-pci.c remove() as a side-effect * EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(ufshcd_dealloc_host) can be removed fully as its not needed anymore * no future drivers using ufshcd_alloc_host() could ever forget adding the cleanup
