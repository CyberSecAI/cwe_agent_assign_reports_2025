  "reference_content": "The provided content is related to CVE-2024-56084.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the ability of authenticated users to inject malicious payloads while creating a Universal Normalizer. These injected payloads are then executed, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nThe primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or validation when creating a Universal Normalizer. This allows for the injection of arbitrary code. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-77, which refers to Command Injection.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nSuccessful exploitation results in Remote Code Execution (RCE), meaning an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This can lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, data manipulation, and denial of service.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe attack vector involves the creation of a Universal Normalizer through the affected application interface, injecting malicious payloads within the parameters used during the creation.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nAn attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the privilege to create Universal Normalizers. The attack requires the attacker to be able to interact with the affected application's interface and functionality that is used for creating universal normalizers. The document states that the Universal Normalizer version 5.6.0 is affected.",

The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly states that the vulnerability is classified as CWE-77, which refers to Command Injection. However, CWE-78, \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\", is a more specific child of CWE-77 and is therefore a better fit. The retriever results also list CWE-78. The graph relationships show that CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77, further supporting this choice. CWE-94, \"Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\", was also considered, but it's a more general case of code injection and less precise than CWE-78, which directly addresses the OS command injection aspect.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-78 directly addresses the **improper neutralization** of input leading to OS command execution, as indicated by the vulnerability description. The evidence from \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states that the vulnerability stems from the ability of authenticated users to inject malicious payloads while creating a Universal Normalizer. These injected payloads are then executed, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**CWE-78** is selected as the primary CWE. The vulnerability allows authenticated users to inject payloads that are then executed, leading to Remote Code Execution. This directly aligns with the description of CWE-78, which involves **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an OS command.\n\n## CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\n**CWE-94** is considered as a secondary CWE.
