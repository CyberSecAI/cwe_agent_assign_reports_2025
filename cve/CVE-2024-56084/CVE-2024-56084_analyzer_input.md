- **attacker:** authenticated users
- **product:** Logpoint UniversalNormalizer
- **version:** before 5.7.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to CVE-2024-56084.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability of authenticated users to inject malicious payloads while creating a Universal Normalizer. These injected payloads are then executed, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or validation when creating a Universal Normalizer. This allows for the injection of arbitrary code. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-77, which refers to Command Injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation results in Remote Code Execution (RCE), meaning an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This can lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, data manipulation, and denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves the creation of a Universal Normalizer through the affected application interface, injecting malicious payloads within the parameters used during the creation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the privilege to create Universal Normalizers. The attack requires the attacker to be able to interact with the affected application's interface and functionality that is used for creating universal normalizers. The document states that the Universal Normalizer version 5.6.0 is affected.
