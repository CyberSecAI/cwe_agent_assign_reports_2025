  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n*   **Root Cause:** Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command within the Task Manager component of Synology BeePhotos and Synology Photos. This is a command injection vulnerability.\n*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Command injection. The application fails to properly sanitize or escape special characters used in commands, allowing an attacker to inject their own commands.\n*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This could lead to complete compromise of the system, including data theft, modification, or denial of service.\n*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via unspecified vectors. This means that the attack can be performed over a network without requiring local access to the device.\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability (PR:N, UI:N). This indicates that the vulnerability is easily exploitable if the affected system is reachable.\n\n**Affected Products (with versions):**\n\n*   Synology BeePhotos:\n    *   Versions prior to 1.0.2-10026\n    *   Versions prior to 1.1.0-10053\n*   Synology Photos:\n    *   Versions prior to 1.6.2-0720\n    *   Versions prior to 1.7.0-0795\n\n**Additional Information:**\n* The vulnerability was reported by PWN2OWN 2024 (ZDI-CAN-25623)\n* The vulnerability has a CVSSv3 score of 9.8, which is critical\n* The vulnerability was discovered by Rick de Jager from Midnight Blue\n\nThis information provides more detail than the generic description of the CVE.",
