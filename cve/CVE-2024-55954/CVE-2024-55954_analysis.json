  "description": "OpenObserve is a cloud-native observability platform. A vulnerability in the user management endpoint `/api/{org_id}/users/{email_id}` allows an Admin role user to remove a Root user from the organization. This violates the intended privilege hierarchy, enabling a non-root user to remove the highest-privileged account. Due to **insufficient role checks**, the `remove_user_from_org` function does not prevent an Admin user from removing a Root user. As a result, an attacker with an Admin role can remove critical Root users, potentially gaining effective full control by eliminating the highest-privileged accounts. The `DELETE /api/{org_id}/users/{email_id}` endpoint is affected. This issue has been addressed in release version `0.14.1` and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

However, the evidence strongly points to a flaw in the authorization logic itself, making CWE-863 the most accurate primary classification. CWE-266 is included as a secondary candidate as it represents the nature of the authorization logic flaw.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n\n    cwe863 -- CANALSOBE --> cwe266\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe266 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient role checks** leading to **improper authorization**, which allows an Admin user to remove a Root user, ultimately leading to potential loss of administrative control.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the specific weakness. The retriever results suggested CWE-863, CWE-285, and CWE-269 as potential candidates. However, based on the vulnerability description, the **insufficient role checks** in the `remove_user_from_org` function most directly aligns with **CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization**. The \"Analysis of CVE-2024-55954 Content\" section reinforces this by highlighting \"Improper Authorization\" as a key weakness. The guidance from \"Privileges vs Permissions Guidance\" was instrumental in focusing on the authorization logic rather than just the technical impact of privilege escalation. CWE-266 is a more specific case of incorrect privilege assignment, but CWE-863 better captures the essence of the flawed authorization logic.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-863 is based on the evidence that the authorization logic is present but flawed, allowing an Admin user to remove a Root user due to **insufficient role checks**.
