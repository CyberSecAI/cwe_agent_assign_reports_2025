The **CSRF** is the primary **weakness** that allows an attacker to force a user to perform unwanted actions. The **XSS** is a secondary **weakness**, which could be exploited due to **improper neutralization** of input.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe352 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **CSRF** vulnerability, which allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious scripts into the application. This leads to the **XSS** vulnerability due to the application's failure to properly neutralize input.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified two key **weaknesses**: **CSRF** and Stored **XSS**. The final classification includes CWE-352 [CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] as the primary **weakness** and CWE-79 [CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] as a secondary **weakness**. This determination is based on the vulnerability description and the provided context, which explicitly mentions both vulnerabilities.
