  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-5252 Content\n\nBased on the provided content, this relates to a SQL injection vulnerability in PHPGurukul News Portal Project V4.1.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user input for the \"emailid\" parameter in the `/admin/edit-subadmin.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized access to the database.\n*   Sensitive data leakage.\n*   Data tampering/modification/deletion.\n*   Potential for complete system control.\n*   Disruption of services.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The \"emailid\" parameter in a POST request to `/admin/edit-subadmin.php`.\n*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Employ prepared statements and parameter binding.\n*   Conduct input validation and filtering.\n*   Minimize database user permissions.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **Vulnerable File:** `/admin/edit-subadmin.php`\n*   **Version:** V4.1\n*   **Software Link:** <https://phpgurukul.com/?sdm_process_download=1&download_id=7643>\n*   **Payload Example:** `adminusernmae=subadmin&emailid=1' AND (SELECT 4547 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))CVig) AND 'MrTV'='MrTV&cdate=2024-01-10 02:30:00&udate=2024-01-31 13:43:01&submit=`\n*   **Vulnerability Request Packet:** (Full HTTP POST request provided)\n*   **SQLMap Output:** Screenshot showing database enumeration using sqlmap.",

While other CWEs like **CWE-79** (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) and **CWE-434** (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) were considered based on retriever results, they did not directly address the root cause of the **SQL Injection** vulnerability. **CWE-89** is a base-level CWE, providing the right level of specificity for this vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of the `emailid` parameter in `/admin/edit-subadmin.php`, leading to **CWE-89** (**SQL Injection**). The impact of this **SQL Injection** could lead to unauthorized data access, data tampering, and potentially complete system compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis strongly suggests that **CWE-89** (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('**SQL Injection**')) is the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**SQL Injection**\" as the **weakness**, aligning directly with **CWE-89**. The CVE reference links content summary further confirms this by highlighting the lack of proper sanitization of the `emailid` parameter, which leads to the **SQL Injection** vulnerability.\n\nThe retriever results also listed **CWE-89** as the top match. While other CWEs like **CWE-79** and **CWE-434** were considered, they are not as directly relevant as **CWE-89**. The provided evidence clearly supports the selection of **CWE-89** as the primary CWE, and it is at the optimal level of specificity (Base).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
