However, the description specifically mentions \"deadlock\" making CWE-833 the most accurate. **CWE-413 (Improper Resource Locking)** is a more specific form of improper locking and could be considered, but is not as directly supported by the evidence.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe833[\"CWE-833: Deadlock\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe413[\"CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking\"]\n\n    cwe833 -->|RELATED_TO| cwe667\n    cwe833 -->|RELATED_TO| cwe362\n    cwe667 -->|CHILDOF| cwe413\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe833 primary\n    class cwe667,cwe362,cwe413 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **deadlock between rcu_tasks_trace and event_mutex**, which directly corresponds to **CWE-833 (Deadlock)**. The deadlock occurs because of lock dependencies when CPU A and CPU B are executing certain functions. The suggested fix involves delegating `trace_set_clr_event()` to a workqueue to avoid this lock dependency. The root cause is the **deadlock** itself, and the impact is the system becoming unresponsive.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is heavily based on the vulnerability description key phrases, especially \"**deadlock between rcu_tasks_trace and event_mutex**\". This phrase provides strong evidence for classifying the vulnerability as **CWE-833 (Deadlock)**. The retriever results also support this classification, with **CWE-833 (Deadlock)** being a top match. While other CWEs like **CWE-667 (Improper Locking)** and **CWE-362 (Race Condition)** are related to concurrency issues, the specific mention of \"deadlock\" makes **CWE-833** the most appropriate choice. The provided evidence is sufficient to confidently classify the vulnerability as **CWE-833**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-833: Deadlock\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not lock or does not correctly lock a resource when the product must have exclusive access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
