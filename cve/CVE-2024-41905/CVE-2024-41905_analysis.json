The attacker could potentially also modify data, since the CVSS vector includes a high impact for integrity.\n- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack (AV:N).\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated with low privileges (PR:L). The attack requires high attack complexity (AC:H).",

While the description mentions a lack of access control, the more specific issue is the **improper authorization**, as the attacker is authenticated but has low privileges, and is able to access sensitive information. The analysis also considered the relationship between CWE-668 and its children but determined that CWE-285 is a better fit as it describes the specific authorization flaw.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe200 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper authorization** (CWE-285) due to **lack of access control**. This leads to the exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200) to an unauthorized actor. The chain highlights how a flaw in authorization can directly result in information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the root cause, which is the application's **lack of access control**. However, after carefully reviewing the vulnerability description and considering the authentication vs. authorization guidance, I concluded that **improper authorization (CWE-285)** is the more accurate classification. The vulnerability description indicates that an authenticated attacker with low privileges can access sensitive information, which points to an authorization issue rather than a complete lack of access control. The final selection is based on the evidence provided in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states that the root cause is a **lack of access control** leading to **improper access control (CWE-284)** and the ability for an attacker to access sensitive information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
