## Vulnerability Description
TOTOLINK EX200 v4.0.3c.7646_B20201211 was found to contain a **command insertion** vulnerability in the setUssd function. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands via the ussd parameter.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command insertion**
- **impact:** execute arbitrary commands
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** TOTOLINK EX200
- **version:** v4.0.3c.7646_B20201211
- **component:** setUssd function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the `setUssd` function of the TOTOLINK EX200 firmware. The `ussd` parameter within an HTTP request is directly injected into a system command without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary shell commands. The input from the `ussd` parameter is passed to the system function without proper sanitization or validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the device's operating system. This could lead to various malicious activities including:
    *   Gaining complete control of the device.
    *   Data exfiltration or manipulation.
    *   Installation of malware.
    *   Denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint.
*   **`ussd` Parameter:** The malicious commands are injected through the `ussd` parameter in the request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device (e.g. on the same network or via port forwarding)
*   **Authentication:** The provided exploit requires a valid `SESSION_ID` cookie, which appears to be obtained by logging into the web interface. Therefore, the attacker either needs to have valid credentials or be able to bypass the authentication mechanism, although the steps for this are not described in the provided text.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided information includes a proof-of-concept (POC) exploit code written in Python, which demonstrates how to leverage the vulnerability.
*   The POC uses shell script delimiters such as `;` to chain commands and redirect output.
*   The exploit's effectiveness was tested using `qemu-system-mipsel` to simulate the target device's environment.

In summary, this document provides substantial details about the command injection vulnerability in the TOTOLINK EX200 firmware, going beyond a basic description by demonstrating the exploitation process and providing a functional POC.
