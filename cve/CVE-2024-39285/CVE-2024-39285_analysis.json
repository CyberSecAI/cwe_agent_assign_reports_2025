No specific child CWEs are apparent from the evidence to allow for more specific classification. The guidance provided stresses using more specific child CWEs of CWE-284 if possible, but the provided vulnerability description does not contain that level of detail.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe284 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control** and leads to information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability based on the provided description and CVE details. The key phrase \"**improper access control**\" strongly suggests CWE-284. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further confirms this by stating \"Root cause of vulnerability: Improper access control\" and \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper access control in the UEFI firmware.\" The impact is \"Information disclosure,\" and the attacker requires local access with privileged user status.\n\nCWE-284 is a high-level category, and the guidance suggests using more specific child CWEs when possible. However, the available information lacks the necessary details to pinpoint a more specific weakness. Therefore, CWE-284 remains the most appropriate choice, albeit at a higher level of abstraction.\n\nThe other CWEs were considered but not chosen because they lacked direct support in the provided evidence. For example, CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was considered but ruled out because the vulnerability description mentions \"privileged user\" and \"local access,\" implying that authentication is present but access control is **improper**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating conditions in which the control flow can be modified in unexpected ways.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar. However, classification research is limited for weaknesses of this type, so there can be gaps or organizational difficulties within CWE that force use of this weakness, even at such a high level of abstraction.\n\n*Not Used:* This is too generic and does not align with the specific **improper access control** root cause.\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n*Not Used:* This is too generic and does not align with the specific **improper access control** root cause.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n*Not Used:* While related to access control, the description focuses on handling insufficient privileges rather than the **improper control** itself.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* Similar to CWE-274, this focuses on handling insufficient privileges rather than the **improper control** itself.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* This is specific to file system path issues and does not align with the general **improper access control** identified.\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* While this relates to access control, there is not enough evidence to support that the issue is insufficient granularity.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* While this aligns with the information disclosure impact, the root cause is still **improper access control**, making CWE-284 more direct.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* There is no information to support that the access control decision relies on untrusted inputs.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Used:* This is not related to access control.\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* This is specific to file system path issues and does not align with the general **improper access control** identified.\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1245.75\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead.
