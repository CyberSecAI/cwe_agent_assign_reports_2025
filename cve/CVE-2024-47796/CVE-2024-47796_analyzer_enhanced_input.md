## Vulnerability Description
An **improper array index validation** vulnerability exists in the nowindow functionality of OFFIS DCMTK 3.6.8. A specially crafted DICOM file can lead to an **out-of-bounds write**. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper array index validation**
- **weakness:** **out-of-bounds write**
- **vector:** specially crafted DICOM file
- **product:** OFFIS DCMTK
- **version:** 3.6.8
- **component:** nowindow functionality

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2024-47796 based on provided content:

**CVE Description:** The provided content includes the CVE description: "OFFIS DCMTK nowindow improper array index validation vulnerability. A specially crafted DICOM file can lead to an out-of-bounds write. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability."

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking when rendering invalid monochrome DICOM images. Specifically, when the number of pixels stored is less than expected, the remaining pixel matrix is filled with a default value (initially 0, changed to the smallest possible value in the fix). This can lead to memory problems detected by AddressSanitizer (ASAN).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Improper array index validation.
*   Out-of-bounds write.
*   Heap-use-after-free (as reported by ASAN).

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Memory corruption.
*   Potential for crashes.
*   The ASAN report suggests a heap-use-after-free condition, which could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution (though this is not explicitly stated).

**Attack vectors:**

*   Providing a specially crafted DICOM file to a system using a vulnerable version of DCMTK.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious DICOM file to the target system. This could be through network transfer, file upload, or other means of file delivery.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The vulnerability has been patched in DCMTK. The commit hash for the fix is `89a6e399f1e17d08a8bc8cdaa05b2ac9a50cd4f6`.
*   The fix changes how the remaining pixel matrix is filled when the stored number of pixels is less than expected, using the smallest possible value instead of 0.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `nowindow` function within the DCMTK code.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when processing monochrome images.
*   The ASAN report provides detailed information about the memory corruption, including the addresses involved and the call stack.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Emmanuel Tacheau of Cisco Talos.
*   The vulnerability is tracked as TALOS-2024-2122.
*   The vulnerable version is DCMTK 3.6.8.
*   The CVSSv3 score is 8.4 (High).
*   The CWE is CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).
