  "description": "GraphQL Mesh is a GraphQL Federation framework and gateway for both GraphQL Federation and non-GraphQL Federation subgraphs, non-GraphQL services, such as REST and gRPC, and also databases such as MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. When a user transforms on the root level or single source with transforms, and the client sends the same query with different variables, the initial variables are used in all following requests until the cache evicts DocumentNode. If a token is sent via variables, the following requests will act like the same token is sent even if the following requests have different tokens. This can cause a short **memory leak** but it wont grow per each request but per different operation until the cache evicts DocumentNode by LRU mechanism.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-27097 based on provided content:\n\nThis content **is relevant** to CVE-2025-27097. It provides details beyond the placeholder description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nWhen transforms are applied at the root level or to a single source with transforms, and a client sends the same query with different variables, the initial variables are used in all subsequent requests until the cache evicts the DocumentNode.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   The vulnerability lies in how `@graphql-mesh/runtime` handles caching of GraphQL queries with variables when transforms are involved.\n*   No CWEs are listed.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Can cause a short memory leak. The leak grows per different operation until the cache evicts the DocumentNode using a Least Recently Used (LRU) mechanism.\n*   Specifically, if a token is sent via variables, subsequent requests will act as if the same token is being sent, even if different tokens are provided in the requests.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker could potentially exploit this by sending a query with sensitive information (like a token) as a variable. Subsequent requests, even with different variables, might reuse the initial sensitive information from the cache.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to send GraphQL queries to the affected application.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade to version 0.96.9 or later of `@graphql-mesh/runtime`.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The advisory explicitly mentions the affected versions (0.96.5, 0.96.6, 0.96.7, 0.96.8) and the patched version (0.96.9).\n*   Credits are given to the reporter (@khell) and the remediation developer (@ardatan).\n*   The vulnerability is categorized as \"High\" severity.",

The key phrase \"**memory leak**\" directly pointed to resource management issues. The retriever results strongly suggested CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) as a primary candidate. Further analysis confirmed that the vulnerability involves a failure to properly release memory after its effective lifetime. The caching mechanism reuses variables, leading to the **memory leak**. This is based on the evidence: \"the initial variables are used in all following requests until the cache evicts DocumentNode.\"\n\nCWE-201 was considered as a secondary weakness. The description states: \"If a token is sent via variables, the following requests will act like the same token is sent even if the following requests have different tokens.\" This indicates that sensitive information could be inserted into unintended data streams.\n\nThese selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the core issues: the **memory leak** due to improper resource management (CWE-401) and the potential for sensitive data exposure (CWE-201).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs multiple related behaviors, but the behaviors are performed in the wrong order in ways which may produce resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed -
