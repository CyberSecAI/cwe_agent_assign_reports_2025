The vulnerability description involves code injection via a Beetl Template Handler, making CWE-1336 a relevant secondary consideration. However, since the description directly states \"**code injection**\" without specifying the template engine aspect as the root cause, CWE-94 is chosen as the primary.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    \n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe1336 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper control of code generation** (CWE-94), potentially facilitated by the **improper neutralization of special elements in a template engine** (CWE-1336). This leads directly to code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the **code injection** vulnerability based on the provided description. The retriever results suggested several CWEs related to injection, including SQL injection, XSS, and template injection. However, the direct mention of \"**code injection**\" in the vulnerability description points towards CWE-94 as the most appropriate primary CWE. CWE-1336 is considered a secondary CWE since the vulnerability involves a Beetl Template Handler, implying the use of a template engine.\n\nThe evidence is based on the vulnerability description which explicitly states \"**code injection**\". The graph relationships helped clarify the relationship between general code injection (CWE-94) and template engine specific injection (CWE-1336). CWE-94 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the identified weakness without over-specifying the attack vector.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
