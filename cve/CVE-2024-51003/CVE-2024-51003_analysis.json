The vulnerability description clearly states that the issue is a **stack overflow**, making CWE-121 the most specific and appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **stack overflow** (CWE-121) due to the `apmode_dns1_pri` and `apmode_dns1_sec` parameters in the `ap_mode.cgi` component. The impact of this overflow is a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states that there are multiple **stack overflow** vulnerabilities. The Retriever Results list CWE-121 as the top result. CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) is a Variant-level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. The evidence is strong and directly supports this classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: CWE-77 is often misused when OS command injection (CWE-78) was intended instead [REF-1287].\n\n*Not Selected:* This CWE relates to command injection, which is not the case here.\n\n## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Selected:* This CWE is selected as the vulnerability description specifically states a **stack overflow**.\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This CWE relates to OS command injection, which is not the case here.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
