This leads to an out-of-bounds write, which could lead to **CWE-787** [Out-of-bounds Write]. If successful, the attacker can then escalate privileges, potentially due to **CWE-250** [Execution with Unnecessary Privileges], where the application runs with more privileges than necessary.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is a **buffer overflow**, specifically **CWE-120** [Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')], because the buffer overflow occurs due to copying without proper size checks. The vulnerability description and CVE details explicitly mention a **buffer overflow** that leads to privilege escalation. The retriever results also list CWE-120 with a reasonable score. The evidence supports this mapping because the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section states \"Root cause of vulnerability: Buffer overflow in some Zoom Apps\" and \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Buffer Overflow.\"\nThe secondary weakness might be **CWE-250** [Execution with Unnecessary Privileges], which relates to the escalation of privilege impact. This suggests that the application might be running with more privileges than it needs, allowing an attacker to escalate privileges more easily after exploiting the **buffer overflow**.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-119 [Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer]: While this is a parent of CWE-120, CWE-120 is more specific and accurately describes the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-190 [Integer Overflow or Wraparound]: This is not relevant as the vulnerability is a buffer overflow, not an integer overflow.\n*   CWE-131 [Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size]: This could be a contributing factor, but the primary issue is the lack of size checking during the buffer copy, making CWE-120 more relevant.\n*   CWE-285 [Improper Authorization]: This might be related to the privilege escalation aspect, but the root cause is the buffer overflow, not an authorization issue.\n*   CWE-269 [Improper Privilege Management]: This is too general, as the specific issue is related to a buffer overflow leading to privilege escalation.",
