# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-46745

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 1.0 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE. The application **does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization** when an authenticated user without user-management permissions could view other users account information. |
| CWE-668 | Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. The application exposes account information to an authenticated user without the appropriate permissions. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is that CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] is a child of CWE-284 [Improper Access Control], offering a more specific classification than its parent. Additionally, CWE-668 [Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere] is a peer that captures the broad impact of the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **missing authorization** checks (CWE-862), which leads to the **exposure of sensitive information** to an unauthorized user (CWE-668).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment and final conclusion are primarily based on the vulnerability description which states, "An authenticated user without user-management permissions could view other users account information." This indicates a clear **lack of proper authorization** mechanisms, aligning well with CWE-862.

The graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the parent-child relationship between CWE-862 and CWE-284, reinforcing the choice of the more specific CWE-862.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-862 directly addresses the **missing authorization**, while CWE-668 captures the resulting **exposure of sensitive data**. This combination provides a clear and concise representation of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges 
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
During installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-281: Improper Preservation of Permissions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not preserve permissions or incorrectly preserves permissions when copying, restoring, or sharing objects, which can cause them to have less restrictive permissions than intended.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.



## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 1245.75
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 1204.18
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).



## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 1201.33
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product does not properly assign,
