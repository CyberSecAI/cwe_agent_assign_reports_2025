CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE, but it directly reflects the **missing permission check** root cause as identified in the description. CWE-668 is also a Class-level CWE, representing the impact of exposing resources to unauthorized actors. While more specific Base-level CWEs exist under both, the available evidence doesn't point to a specific type of authorization failure or resource exposure, justifying the use of these Class-level CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe923[\"CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel\"]\n\n    cwe668 -->|CANBE CAUSED BY| cwe862\n    cwe862 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe668\n    cwe923 -->|PEEROF| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with a **missing permission check** (CWE-862), which directly results in local information disclosure (CWE-668) because the resource is exposed to the wrong control sphere.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a **missing permission check** as the root cause, leading to local information disclosure. The Retriever Results list CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** as the top candidate, which aligns perfectly with the provided root cause. The CWE Classification Guidance also identifies CWE-862 as appropriate when authorization logic is completely missing. I am using CWE-668 **Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere** to describe the impact of the vulnerability.\n\nThe evidence for CWE-862 is derived directly from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\":\n*   \"**rootcause:** **missing permission check**\"\n\nThe evidence for CWE-668 is derived directly from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\":\n*   \"**impact:** local information disclosure\"\n\nThe relationships between CWEs helped finalize the selection. In particular, the CANPRECEDE relationship from CWE-862 to CWE-668 highlights how a **missing authorization** can lead to the **exposure of a resource to the wrong sphere**.\n\nThe choice of Class-level CWEs (CWE-862 and CWE-668) is based on the limited information available. While more specific Base or Variant CWEs might exist, the current evidence doesn't justify their selection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
