The selected CWE is at the Base level, providing a clear and direct representation of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe200 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward: **Inappropriate implementation** -> Exposure of Sensitive Information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which points to an **inappropriate implementation** in Fenced Frames leading to the exposure of potentially sensitive information.\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 is based on the direct impact described in the vulnerability description. The retriever results suggested other CWEs, but none of them accurately capture the root cause and impact.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
