## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-328, which describes the use of a weak hash function. CWE-328 is a child of CWE-327, which describes the use of broken or risky cryptographic algorithms. CWE-327 is a class-level CWE, while CWE-328 is a base-level CWE, making it more specific. CWE-916 relates to password hashing with insufficient computational effort and is a peer of CWE-328.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure hashing algorithm** (MD5) being used. This leads to the potential for hash collisions, which allows attackers to manipulate user account information.
  - **Root Cause:** CWE-328 Use of Weak Hash
  - **Impact:** Manipulation of user account information

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability is due to the use of the MD5 hashing algorithm, which is considered a **weak hashing algorithm**, within the Gravatars service of Navidrome v0.52.3. This allows attackers to potentially manipulate user account information. The primary CWE is CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash), as it directly addresses the **root cause** of using MD5. CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) is a related, more general CWE, and could be considered as a secondary classification. CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) is also considered since MD5 is often associated with password hashing.

The evidence from the vulnerability description key phrases clearly states: "**rootcause:** **insecure hashing algorithm**". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms: "Navidrome v0.52.3 uses the MD5 **hashing algorithm** to generate URLs for Gravatar avatars instead of the more secure SHA-256 algorithm."

The retriever results also show that CWE-328 is the top combined result.

CWE-328 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.
CWE-327 is at the Class level of abstraction, which is less preferred.
CWE-916 is at the Base level of abstraction.

CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values) was considered but deemed less relevant as the primary issue is the weakness of the hash function itself, not the randomness of the input values.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
An algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.65
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might
