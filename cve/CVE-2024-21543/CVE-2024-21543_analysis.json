This is because the system falls back to querying the database directly, granting access to users with valid credentials, and eventually bypassing custom authentication checks such as two-factor authentication, LDAP validations, or requirements from configured AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-21543:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the `djoser` package's authentication process. When the `authenticate()` function, which should be the primary method for validating user credentials against configured authentication backends, fails, the system falls back to directly querying the database. This bypasses custom authentication checks implemented in `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`, such as two-factor authentication, LDAP validations, or custom permission checks within backends. Specifically, after `authenticate` fails, the code checks if a user exists with the provided login field and then if the password matches, granting a token if both are true.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the bypass of the Django authentication backends, which are designed to provide a pluggable authentication system, including custom logic for authentication.\n*   **Inconsistent Authentication Flow:** `djoser`'s custom password check after failed `authenticate` call is inconsistent with standard Django authentication practices, which should respect the configured backends.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers with valid credentials could bypass multi-factor authentication, LDAP authentication, or other restrictions imposed by `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts and resources.\n*   **Circumvention of Security Policies:** The vulnerability allows bypassing configured security policies enforced by custom authentication backends.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network through the standard login endpoints provided by `djoser`.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to possess valid user credentials (username/email and password) that are present in the database.\n*   The attacker does not require any special privileges or user interaction.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was introduced due to a prior fix for issue #389, which caused the authentication bypass.\n*   The fix involves ensuring that only the result of `authenticate()` is used, preventing the fallback to database query and direct password check.\n*   The vulnerability affects versions of `djoser` prior to 2.3.0.\n*   The issue was reported by user 'hisie' and addressed by 'tomwojcik'.\n*   A proof-of-concept of the vulnerability exists.\n\nThis information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, providing a clear explanation of the vulnerability's root cause, impact, and how to mitigate it.",
