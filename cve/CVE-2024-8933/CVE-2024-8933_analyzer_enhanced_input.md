## Vulnerability Description
CWE-924 **Improper Enforcement of Message Integrity During Transmission in a Communication Channel** vulnerability exists that could cause retrieval of password hash that could lead to denial of service and loss of confidentiality and integrity of controllers. To be successful, the attacker needs to inject themself inside the logical network while a valid user uploads or downloads a project file into the controller.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Improper Enforcement of Message Integrity During Transmission in a Communication Channel**
- **impact:** Integrity and denial of service and loss of confidentiality and retrieval of password hash
- **vector:** injecting into logical network during file upload/download

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper Enforcement of Message Integrity During Transmission in a Communication Channel
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability exists due to improper enforcement of message integrity, which allows an attacker to inject themselves into the logical network during project file uploads/downloads. This results in retrieval of password hashes
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to retrieval of password hashes, denial of service, and loss of confidentiality and integrity of controllers.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to inject themselves inside the logical network while a valid user uploads or downloads a project file into the controller.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be positioned within the same logical network as the controller and the user's engineering workstation and needs to be present during project file upload/download operation.
