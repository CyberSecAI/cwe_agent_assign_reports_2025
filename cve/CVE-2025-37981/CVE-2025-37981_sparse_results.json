  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi smartpqi Use is_kdump_kernel() to check for kdump The smartpqi driver checks the reset_devices variable to determine whether special adjustments need to be made for kdump. This has the effect that after a regular kexec reboot, some driver parameters such as max_transfer_size are much lower than usual. More importantly, kexec reboot tests have revealed memory corruption caused by the driver log being written to system memory after a kexec. Fix this by testing is_kdump_kernel() rather than reset_devices where appropriate.",
