## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in SourceCodester Online Eyewear Shop 1.0. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /Users.phpf=save of the component User Creation Handler. The manipulation of the argument type with the input 1 leads to **improper authorization**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **improper authorization**
- **product:** SourceCodester Online Eyewear Shop
- **version:** 1
- **component:** /Users.phpf=save

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks in the `Users.php` file, specifically when handling the `save` function. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended access controls and create user accounts with arbitrary roles (e.g., administrator).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure User Creation:** The application doesn't properly validate or restrict the `type` parameter during user creation, leading to arbitrary user role assignment.
*   **Missing Authorization:** There's an absence of access controls or authentication checks that should prevent unauthorized users from adding new users, especially with administrative privileges.
*   **Direct Access to Backend Functionality**: The `Users.php` file with the `save` function seems directly accessible and manipulatable without proper security measures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Account Takeover:** Attackers can create administrator accounts, granting them full control over the application.
*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:** With admin access, attackers can potentially steal, modify, or delete sensitive data stored within the application.
*   **System Compromise:** Complete compromise of the online shop functionality.
*   **Business Disruption:**  The attack can lead to a complete outage of the service and damage the reputation of the affected shop.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request Manipulation:** The attacker sends a modified HTTP POST request directly to `/oews/classes/Users.php?f=save` with malicious values for user details and 'type' parameter, specifically setting it to '1' for an administrator role.
*   **Bypassing Front-End Controls:**  The vulnerability is exploited by directly interacting with the backend, bypassing any client-side controls that might have been intended to restrict user creation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:**  The attacker must have network access to the server running the application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable endpoint (`/oews/classes/Users.php?f=save`) and the structure of the HTTP request to send.
*   **Ability to Forge Requests:**  The attacker should be able to forge an HTTP POST request, including the required parameters to create a user with admin rights.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
