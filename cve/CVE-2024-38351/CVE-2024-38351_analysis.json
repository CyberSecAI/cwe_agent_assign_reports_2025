  "description": "Pocketbase is an open source web backend written in go. In affected versions a malicious user may be able to compromise other user accounts. In order to be exploited users must have both OAuth2 and Password auth methods enabled. A possible attack scenario could be 1. a malicious actor register with the targeted users email (it is unverified), 2. at some later point in time the targeted user stumble on your app and decides to sign-up with OAuth2 (_this step could be also initiated by the attacker by sending an invite email to the targeted user_), 3. on successful OAuth2 auth we search for an existing PocketBase user matching with the OAuth2 users email and associate them, 4. because we havent changed the password of the existing PocketBase user during the linking, the malicious actor has access to the targeted user account and will be able to login with the initially created email/password. To prevent this for happening we now reset the password for this specific case if the previously created user wasnt verified (an exception to this is if the linking is explicit/manual, aka. when you send `AuthorizationTOKEN` with the OAuth2 auth call). Additionally to warn existing users we now send an email alert in case the user has logged in with password but has at least one OAuth2 account linked. The flow will be further improved with ongoing refactoring and we will start sending emails for unrecognized device logins (OTP and MFA is already implemented and will be available wit",

This is followed by the target user signing up via OAuth2, either naturally or due to an invite from the attacker. When the system attempts to link these two accounts, the vulnerability is triggered.\",\n    \"required_capabilities\": \"The attacker needs to know the email address of the intended victim and the targeted application must have both password-based and OAuth2 authentication enabled. No special privileges are required. The attacker needs to create an account with the victim's email address before the victim does and must have the ability to initiate an account link, either by natural actions of the victim or by invitation.\"\n  },\n  \"additional_details\": \"The vulnerability is addressed by resetting the password when linking an OAuth2 account to an existing unverified account. Additionally, an email alert is sent to users who log in with a password after linking an OAuth2 account to notify them of potential unauthorized access, prompting them to change their password. The vulnerability is present in PocketBase versions before v0.22.14. The fix is present in version v0.22.14 and later.

CWE-306, Missing Authentication for Critical Function, is a related weakness as the linking of accounts is a critical function that lacks proper authentication. The relationship between CWE-287 and CWE-306 is that CWE-306 can be a child of CWE-287, suggesting that the missing authentication contributes to the broader issue of improper authentication.

CWE-306, Missing Authentication for Critical Function, is a secondary weakness because the account linking process lacks proper authentication mechanisms.\n\nThe provided evidence supports the classification, as the vulnerability description explicitly states that the application **does not** change the password of the existing PocketBase user during the linking, allowing the malicious actor to login with the initially created email/password. The graph relationships influenced the decision by highlighting the hierarchical connection between improper authentication and missing authentication for critical functions.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the application's failure to properly verify user identities during OAuth2 linking.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-1390: Weak Authentication - While relevant, it is a class level CWE and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate, but none of the children are a good fit.\n*   CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization - Authorization is a later process, and is not the cause of the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data - This is not the root cause of the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-620: Unverified Password Change - Not directly applicable as the issue is more about account linking than password changes.\n*   CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data - Not applicable.",
