  "description": "Cobbler, a Linux installation server that allows for rapid setup of network installation environments, has an **improper authentication vulnerability** starting in version 3.0.0 and prior to versions 3.2.3 and 3.3.7. `utils.get_shared_secret()` always returns `-1`, which allows anyone to connect to cobbler XML-RPC as user `` password `-1` and make any changes. This gives anyone with network access to a cobbler server full control of the server. Versions 3.2.3 and 3.3.7 fix the issue.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47533:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from an error in how the `get_shared_secret()` function in `cobbler/utils.py` handles the `/var/lib/cobbler/web.ss` file. Specifically, the code attempts to open the file in binary mode ('rb') while also specifying an encoding ('utf-8'), which raises an exception. Due to the exception handler, the function always returns -1 instead of the actual shared secret.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Incorrect File Handling:** The core issue is the attempt to use an encoding when opening a file in binary mode, causing the `get_shared_secret` function to always return -1, effectively disabling shared secret authentication.\n- **Authentication Bypass:** Because the `get_shared_secret` function returns -1, the XML-RPC server uses this value as a valid shared secret, which means any attacker can connect to the server using an empty username and -1 as the password. This bypasses normal authentication procedures and provides full access.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Full Control of Cobbler Server:** An attacker can gain complete control of the Cobbler server via the XML-RPC interface.\n- **Unauthorized Modifications:** Attackers can modify system configurations, potentially leading to system compromise or data manipulation.\n- **Denial of Service:** An attacker may also be able to disrupt the service by making changes that lead to its malfunction.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Network Access:** The primary attack vector is network access to the Cobbler XML-RPC server.\n- **XML-RPC Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited via the XML-RPC interface by providing an empty username and the hardcoded incorrect shared secret (-1) as the password.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the Cobbler server.\n- **No Credentials Required:** The attacker does not need any valid username or password since the shared secret is always the same incorrect value (-1).\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The vulnerability was introduced by commit `32c5cada013dc8daa7320a8eda9932c2814742b0`\n- Patched versions are 3.3.7 and 3.2.3\n- The vulnerability is rated as critical due to the potential impact of full server control\n\nIn summary, this is a critical vulnerability that allows any remote attacker with network access to fully control the Cobbler server due to an authentication bypass.",

The secondary CWE is CWE-259, which describes the use of a hard-coded password. CWE-306 is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), indicating a broader category of authentication flaws. CWE-259 is a variant of CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials). The vulnerability involves a critical function (XML-RPC access) lacking proper authentication, allowing access with a fixed \"password\" (-1). Therefore, both CWE-306 and CWE-259 are relevant.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe259 secondary\n    class cwe287,cwe798 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect implementation** in `utils.get_shared_secret()` that always returns `-1`. This leads to **missing authentication** for the XML-RPC interface because the system treats `-1` as a valid shared secret, effectively acting as a **hard-coded password**. This results in **full control of the Cobbler server** for anyone with network access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-306 and CWE-259 as the most relevant CWEs, and I maintain this assessment. The vulnerability description clearly states the **improper authentication vulnerability**, which is caused by the `get_shared_secret()` function always returning `-1`. This bypasses the authentication mechanism and allows anyone with network access to connect to the Cobbler XML-RPC server with full control. The root cause is the missing authentication check (CWE-306) due to the faulty shared secret retrieval, and the impact is facilitated by the use of a hard-coded \"password\" (CWE-259). The retriever results and the complete CWE specifications support this assessment. The guidance on Authentication vs Authorization helped confirm that this is primarily an authentication issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
