The specific impact would vary depending on the actions the plugin allows and which are vulnerable to this attack.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- The attack vector is through Cross-Site Request Forgery. This typically involves tricking a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious webpage that sends a forged request to the vulnerable WordPress plugin.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into executing a malicious request.\\n- The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit the vulnerability, they leverage the existing authentication of a logged-in user.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.1, though Patchstack classifies the severity as low, stating that it is unlikely to be exploited.\\n- The vulnerable versions are <= 1.1 of the Amazon Product Price plugin.\\n- There is no official fix available for this vulnerability.\\n- Patchstack reports that it was originally disclosed by SOPROBRO on October 27, 2024.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:Stored XSS', 'keyphrase': 'Stored XSS', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:Alok Tiwari Amazon Product Price', 'keyphrase': 'Alok Tiwari Amazon Product Price', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:through 1.1', 'keyphrase': 'through 1.1', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(284.89530912122376)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '434', 'name': 'Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'impact:Stored XSS', 'keyphrase': 'Stored XSS', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'version:through 1.1', 'keyphrase': 'through 1.1', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(208.28991703914517)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
