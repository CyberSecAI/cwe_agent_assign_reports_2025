  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-40898:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) issue within the Apache HTTP Server when running on Windows. This occurs specifically when `mod_rewrite` is used within the server or virtual host context.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **SSRF:** The core vulnerability is an SSRF. The server, under specific configurations, can be tricked into making requests to arbitrary locations, as dictated by a malicious actor.\n*   **NTLM Hash Leakage:** The SSRF can be exploited to potentially leak NTLM hashes. This is a critical vulnerability for Windows environments.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **NTLM Hash Theft:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to potentially obtain NTLM hashes from the server by directing it to connect to a malicious server. These hashes can then be potentially cracked or reused in pass-the-hash attacks.\n*   **Information Disclosure:** More broadly, SSRF vulnerabilities can lead to information disclosure about internal systems or networks that are reachable from the vulnerable server.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Malicious HTTP Requests:** The attack is triggered by crafting malicious HTTP requests that exploit `mod_rewrite` configurations on Windows to initiate the SSRF.\n*   **`mod_rewrite` in Server/vhost context:** The vulnerability is specific to the usage of `mod_rewrite` within the server or virtual host configuration context on Windows.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Apache server.\n*   **Knowledge of mod_rewrite:** The attacker needs to be able to craft specific requests that can manipulate the server due to the use of the `mod_rewrite` module.\n*   **Windows Environment:** The exploit targets Windows environments.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n*   The vulnerability is specific to Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.61.\n*   The fix for the vulnerability is included in version 2.4.62.\n*   NetApp products that incorporate Apache HTTP Server may also be affected, though many products are listed as not affected or under investigation.",

CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) is related to the impact of leaking NTLM hashes. The abstraction levels are appropriate, with CWE-918 at the Base level, and CWE-532 at the Base Level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    \n    cwe918 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe532\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe918 primary\n    class cwe532 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **SSRF** (CWE-918), which allows for the potential leakage of NTLM hashes. This leaked information (NTLM hashes) can be considered sensitive information. If this information were logged, it would result in CWE-532.

The description states \"**SSRF** in Apache HTTP Server on Windows with mod_rewrite in server/vhost context, allows to potentially leak NTML hashes to a malicious server via **SSRF** and malicious requests.\" The summary also confirms \"The core vulnerability is an SSRF.\"\n\nThe choice of CWE-918 is supported by the retriever results, which gives it a score of 1.0.
