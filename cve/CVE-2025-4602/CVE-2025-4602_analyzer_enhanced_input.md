# Vulnerability Description

    The eMagicOne Store Manager for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Reads in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.5 via the get_file() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information. This is only exploitable by unauthenticated attackers in **default configurations** where the the **default password** is left as 11, or where the attacker gains access to the credentials.
