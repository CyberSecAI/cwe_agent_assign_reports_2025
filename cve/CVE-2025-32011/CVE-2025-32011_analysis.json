It is a Base level CWE. CWE-287 is a Class level CWE. CWE-22 can lead to authentication bypass, which could be considered a type of impact.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe22 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** (CWE-22), which allows a remote attacker to **bypass authentication** (CWE-287) and gain unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates that an **authentication bypass** is possible due to a **path traversal** vulnerability. This suggests that the root cause is an **improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory** (CWE-22), which then leads to the **improper authentication** (CWE-287).\n\nThe retriever results also support this conclusion, with CWE-22 being a top candidate for both the \"path traversal\" and \"authentication bypass vulnerability\" keyphrases. The evidence, however, is limited.\n\nCWE-287 was considered as a primary CWE, but it is more of an impact of the **path traversal**. Therefore, CWE-22 is the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\nThis CWE is not relevant since the vulnerability doesn't relate to the usage of weak credentials.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis CWE is not selected because it's less specific than CWE-22 and CWE-23.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis CWE is not selected as the vulnerability isn't directly about an incorrect authentication algorithm.\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-23 is similar to CWE-22 but is not selected as CWE-22 is broader and better captures the general \"path traversal\" vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis CWE is not selected as it's an impact rather than the root cause.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\nThis CWE is less specific than CWE-287 and is not selected.\n\n## CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication algorithm is sound, but the implemented mechanism can be bypassed as the result of a separate weakness that is primary to the authentication error.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis CWE is not selected as the vulnerability is directly about a **path traversal** and not a bypass due to another weakness.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis CWE is not selected as there is no specific indication that the vulnerability involves relying on untrusted inputs in a security decision beyond the path traversal itself.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\nThis CWE is not selected as it's too general and there's no specific mention of data authenticity issues.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
