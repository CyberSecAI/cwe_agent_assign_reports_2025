CWE-204 is a child of CWE-203 and represents a specific type of observable discrepancy related to the response. The relationship influenced the decision to include CWE-204 as a secondary CWE providing more specific context to the weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe203[\"CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe204[\"CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\"]\n    \n    cwe204 -->|CHILDOF| cwe203\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe203 primary\n    class cwe204 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing extra characters injection** in the broadcasted frames. This leads to an observable discrepancy where an attacker can determine the length of encrypted messages, impacting the confidentiality of the communication.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the goTenna Pro App **does not inject extra characters into broadcasted frames**, leading to an **observable discrepancy** in message length. This allows attackers to infer information about the payload even with encryption. The primary CWE is CWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy), which captures the general weakness. However, to provide more context, CWE-204 (Observable Response Discrepancy) is included as a secondary CWE.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states, \"The goTenna Pro App does not inject extra characters into broadcasted frames to obfuscate the length of messages. This makes it possible to tell the length of the payload regardless of the encryption used.\"\n\nCWE-203 is selected as the primary because the **rootcause** is a **missing** obfuscation technique that makes the message length observable to an attacker. CWE-204 is a specific case of CWE-203, focusing on the response characteristic, which is the broadcasted frame revealing the message length.

This is often a component in phishing attacks.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 803.71\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 748.53\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\n\n\n## CWE Relationship Analysis\n\nCurrent CWEs represent these abstraction levels: .\n\n\n### Vulnerability Chain Analysis\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-116:**\n- 116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output) - ROOT\n\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-203:**\n- 203 (Observable Discrepancy) - ROOT\n\n\n\n### CWE Relationship Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n```",
