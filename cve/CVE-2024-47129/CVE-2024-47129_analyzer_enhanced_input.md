## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-47129:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The goTenna Pro App does not inject extra characters into broadcasted frames, which reveals the length of the payload, even when encryption is used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Observable Response Discrepancy (CWE-204). The app's broadcasted frames lack padding or obfuscation of the message length.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can determine the length of encrypted messages, potentially aiding in cryptanalysis or revealing information about the communication.

**Attack Vectors:** An attacker within radio range of the goTenna Pro devices can passively observe the broadcasted frames.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be within radio range of the goTenna devices and have the ability to capture and analyze radio transmissions.

**Summary of CVE-2024-47129:**
This vulnerability allows an attacker to determine the length of encrypted messages by observing the unpadded broadcasted frames.
