# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-37796
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi at76c50x fix use after free access in at76_disconnect The memory pointed to by priv is freed at the end of at76_delete_device function (using ieee80211_free_hw). But the code then accesses the udev field of the freed object to put the USB device. This may also lead to a memory leak of the usb device. Fix this by using udev from interface.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'use after free'
