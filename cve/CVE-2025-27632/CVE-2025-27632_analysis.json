CWE-74 is a class-level CWE that encompasses a broad range of injection vulnerabilities. CWE-113 is a variant that is more specific, detailing CRLF injection in HTTP headers. However, the description does not give enough details to confirm CRLF, so I am selecting the more general CWE-74.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe74 primary\n    class cwe113 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of vulnerability starts with the **host header injection** due to **improper neutralization** that leads to web-cache poisoning and defacing the site content.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, focusing on the root cause and impact. The description explicitly mentions \"**host header injection**,\" which points to an injection-related weakness. The retriever results also suggest CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) and CWE-113 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')). CWE-74 is selected as the primary CWE because it is a broader category encompassing various injection types, and the description doesn't provide specific details about the type of injection beyond host header modification. CWE-113 is considered as a secondary candidate because it is a more specific type of injection related to CRLF sequences in HTTP headers, but it isn't explicitly confirmed by the vulnerability description. The selection is influenced by the need to be specific while staying within the bounds of the provided evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it

replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally
