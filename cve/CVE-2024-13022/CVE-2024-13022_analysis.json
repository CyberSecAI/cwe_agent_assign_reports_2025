  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in taisan tarzan-cms 1.0.0. This affects the function UploadResponse of the file src/main/java/com/tarzan/cms/modules/admin/controller/common/UploadController.java of the component Article Management. The manipulation of the argument file leads to **unrestricted upload**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the lack of proper file content validation in the `OssService.upload` method. This method receives a `MultipartFile` object, checks only if it's null, and then proceeds to store the file without verifying its content or type.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The primary weakness is the ability to upload any type of file, including potentially executable ones like `.jsp`, `.php`, or `.html`, as well as malicious files.\n- **Lack of Content Validation:** The code lacks checks to validate the file's content, extension, or MIME type.\n- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:**  The file name and contents are not sanitized, making it possible to upload files with malicious names or embedded code.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading malicious files (e.g., a JSP file containing server-side code) an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially gaining complete control of the system.\n- **Website Defacement:** Attackers could upload files to deface the website or inject malicious scripts to redirect users to malicious sites or steal user data.\n- **Data Breaches:**  If the attacker gains access to the server they could potentially access sensitive data stored on the system.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Web Interface:** The attack vector involves the `/upload` endpoint, accessible through the article management section in the application's web interface.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to access the `/upload` endpoint which appears to be behind authentication.\n- The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests to change the filename and potentially the contents of the file being uploaded.\n- Basic understanding of HTTP requests and web application interaction.\n- Knowledge of how to create malicious files (e.g., JSP, PHP).\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The provided code snippets and screenshots directly show the vulnerability in the `UploadController` and `OssService` classes.\n- The issue was reported in the gitee repository issues section for the `tarzan-cms` project, which validates the report's relevance.\n- The attack involves intercepting the file upload request, modifying the filename and potentially the contents, and submitting the modified request to upload malicious file.\n- The report also provides the repository name: `taisan/tarzan-cms`,  and the specific vulnerable files within the repository `src/main/java/com/tarzan/cms/modules/admin/controller/common/UploadController.java` and `src/main/java/com/tarzan/cms/modules/admin/service/common/OssService.java`",

The \"Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\" aligns with the **\"unrestricted upload\"** weakness described. Additionally, CWE-646 is a variant that describes a specific type of unrestricted file upload where the system relies on the filename or extension, which is relevant because the summary states the code lacks checks to validate the file's content, extension, or MIME type. CWE-306 is related because the attacker appears to need to be authenticated to access the /upload endpoint.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    cwe646[\"CWE-646: Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe646 -->|PEEROF| cwe434\n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe434\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe434 primary\n    class cwe646,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **unrestricted upload** due to the **lack of proper file content validation**. This leads to the ability to upload malicious files which could then lead to Remote Code Execution and Website Defacement.\n  - The first in the \"Vulnerability Chain\" is CWE-434 **Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type** because that is the **weakness**.\n  - It is then followed by CWE-646 **Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File**, which is a variant of unrestricted file upload\n  - The chain then requires CWE-306 **Missing Authentication for Critical Function** to be able to access the upload endpoint.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **unrestricted upload** weakness, which directly corresponds to CWE-434. The retriever results also highlighted CWE-434 as a top candidate, solidifying this choice. The vulnerability description key phrases also point to **unrestricted upload**. The evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the root cause is the **lack of proper file content validation** in the `OssService.upload` method, which allows any type of file to be uploaded.\n\nThe selection of CWE-434 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the core weakness. While other CWEs like CWE-22 (Path Traversal) or CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting) could be potential impacts of exploiting the **unrestricted upload**, they are not the root cause. CWE-646, while closely related to CWE-434, is more specific because the filename or extension of externally-supplied file is being relied upon which causes the vulnerability. The evidence supports this because the summary states the code lacks checks to validate the file's content, extension, or MIME type.\n\nCWE-306 is included as a secondary CWE because the attacker appears to need to be authenticated to access the /upload endpoint.\n\nCWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')), CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')), CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')), and CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) were considered but not used because they are not the root cause of this vulnerability. They could be consequences of exploiting the **unrestricted upload**, but the initial weakness is the **unrestricted upload** itself.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n## CWE-646: Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File\nThe program relies on the file name or extension of an externally-supplied file to make decisions about the file's type or the actions that will be performed on it. This can lead to vulnerabilities if the file name or extension is not a reliable indicator of the file's actual content or intended use.\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\nThe application does not require authentication for a resource or function that requires it.",
