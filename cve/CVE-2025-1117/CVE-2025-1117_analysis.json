  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in CoinRemitter 0.0.1/0.0.2 on OpenCart. This affects an unknown part. The manipulation of the argument coin leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 0.0.3 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.",

It details a security vulnerability in the CoinRemitter Opencart module. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   OpenCart's database API lacks prepared statements or parameterized inputs, leaving the module vulnerable to SQL injection.\n*   Failure to properly validate and sanitize user input before constructing SQL queries.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** Multiple SQLi vulnerabilities exist, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to access and manipulate the database.\n*   **Hardcoded Encryption:** The encryption details for coinremitter wallet passwords are hardcoded and publicly available, enabling decryption of stolen credentials.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Data Breach:** Access to all content stored in the database, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and payment details.\n*   **Credential Theft:** Retrieval of API credentials for coinremitter wallets, including unencrypted passwords.\n*   **Account Compromise:** Potential compromise of admin accounts and session details.\n*   **Financial Loss:** Potential theft from compromised wallets.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Unauthenticated POST requests to specific module endpoints (e.g., `/index.php?route=extension/coinremitter/module/coinremitter_invoice|payment_history`, `/index.php?route=extension/coinremitter/payment/coinremitter|notify`).\n*   Exploitation of SQLi vulnerabilities through crafted input parameters.\n*   Blind SQLi techniques when error reporting is disabled.\n*   Exploitation of hardcoded encryption to decrypt stolen passwords.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   No authentication required for some exploits.\n*   Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.\n*   Ability to craft malicious POST requests.\n*   Access to tools like `sqlmap` for automated exploitation.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Properly validate all unsafe input used in SQL queries.\n*   Cast values to numeric formats where appropriate.\n*   Use the database driver's escape method to sanitize input.\n*   Avoid hardcoding cryptographic keys.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   Specific examples of SQLi payloads are provided.\n*   Details on how to decrypt stolen passwords using the hardcoded encryption key.\n*   Timeline of vulnerability disclosure and patching.\n*   Links to the vulnerable module on OpenCart Marketplace and GitHub.\n*   CVSS score: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L 9.9 Critical\n*   Vulnerable versions are identified.\n*   The Github release notes for version 0.0.3 mention \"Security Improved\" and \"Bug Fixes\" which likely address the reported vulnerabilities.",

The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this, stating \"OpenCart's database API lacks prepared statements or parameterized inputs, leaving the module vulnerable to SQL injection\" and \"Failure to properly validate and sanitize user input before constructing SQL queries\". The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the top candidate. The description clearly states \"The manipulation of the argument coin leads to **sql injection**\".

CWE-79 (Cross-Site Scripting) was considered because it also involves **improper neutralization** of input, but the vulnerability specifically involves **SQL injection**, making CWE-89 a more appropriate choice.

Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
