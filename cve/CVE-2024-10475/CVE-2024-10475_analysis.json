It details a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Lead Form Builder plugin. Here's an extraction of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, allowing for XSS attacks.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nHigh privilege users (e.g., admin) can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker with admin privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code into the \"Default Value\" field of a form.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Admin privileges or a role with similar capabilities.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.9.8 of the plugin.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **Proof of Concept:** Detailed steps are provided to reproduce the vulnerability.\n*   **CVSS Score:** 3.5 (Low)\n*   **References:** Links to the CVE entry ([https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-10475](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-10475)) and a research report ([https://research.cleantalk.org/CVE-2024-10475](https://research.cleantalk.org/CVE-2024-10475)).\n*   **Researcher:** Krugov Artyom\n*   **Timeline:** Publicly published on 2024-10-23, added to the database on 2025-03-03, and last updated on 2025-03-03.\n*   **WPVDB ID:** faca59fb-6b59-45b0-8b97-c4125d9d3cb3\n*   **OWASP Top 10:** A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n*   **CWE:** CWE-79",

It's also directly mentioned in the \"Analysis of CVE-2024-10475 Content\" section, increasing confidence. No other relationships significantly impacted the decision, as CWE-79 directly addresses the vulnerability described.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe79 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper sanitization and escaping of settings** which leads to a **Cross-Site Scripting** vulnerability. The attacker, a high privilege user, can then perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which is strong. The vulnerability description clearly states that the plugin **does not sanitise and escape some of its settings**, which leads to a Stored **Cross-Site Scripting** vulnerability. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirms this by stating \"The plugin **does not sanitise and escape some of its settings**, allowing for XSS attacks\" and explicitly listing \"Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\" as a weakness. The retriever results also list CWE-79 as a potential candidate, although it is not the top result. Given the explicit mention of XSS and the root cause of missing sanitization, CWE-79 is the most appropriate CWE. It is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) and directly addresses the weakness described.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
