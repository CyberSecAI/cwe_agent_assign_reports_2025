# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-11215

## Vulnerability Description
**Absolute path traversal** (incorrect restriction of a path to a restricted directory) vulnerability in the EasyPHP web server, affecting version 14.1. This vulnerability could allow remote users to bypass SecurityManager restrictions and retrieve any file stored on the server by setting only consecutive strings /...%5c.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **Absolute path traversal**
- **impact:** bypass SecurityManager restrictions and retrieve any file
- **vector:** setting only consecutive strings /...%5c
- **attacker:** remote users
- **product:** EasyPHP web server
- **version:** 14.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is an absolute path traversal issue due to "incorrect restriction of a path to a restricted directory" within the EasyPHP web server.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is a CWE-22 vulnerability, which means improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory. This allows an attacker to traverse directories outside the intended web root.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows remote users to bypass `SecurityManager` restrictions and retrieve any file stored on the server. It's a confidentiality issue as attackers can access sensitive files.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). The vulnerability is triggered by sending crafted requests containing consecutive strings `/...%5c`. This appears to bypass the intended path restrictions.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L), and no user interaction is required (UI:N).

**Additional details not explicitly in the CVE description:**

*   The specific method of exploitation involves using `/...%5c` sequences in the request to bypass the `SecurityManager`.
*   The affected version is EasyPHP web server version 14.1
*   The CVSS score is 6.5 with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, highlighting the high confidentiality impact.
*   There is no known solution or patch available at this time.
