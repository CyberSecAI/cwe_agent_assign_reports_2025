*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the parent-child relationship between CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions) and its potential impact, CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor). While CWE-200 describes the impact, CWE-276 better captures the root cause of the vulnerability. CWE-276 is also a child of CWE-732 (Incorrect or Incomplete Delegation of Privilege), which could be considered but is less specific than CWE-276.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect default permissions (CWE-276)**, leading to the **exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200)** to unauthorized actors when the CDE server is installed with default settings.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description states that "**Installing CDE Server with default settings** allows unauthorized users to visit prometheus metrics page," indicating a problem with the initial configuration of the server. This aligns with **CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions)**.

The reference summary states that the vulnerability type is "CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor," but CWE-200 is the impact, not the root cause. The root cause is the **incorrect default settings** that allowed unauthorized access. The **exposure of sensitive information** is a consequence of the **incorrect default permissions**.

Therefore, **CWE-276** is the primary CWE because it represents the root cause, while **CWE-200** represents the resulting impact.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].



## CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product's intended functionality exposes information to certain actors in accordance with the developer's security policy, but this information is regarded as sensitive according to the intended security policies of other stakeholders such as the product's administrator, users, or others whose information is being processed.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.
