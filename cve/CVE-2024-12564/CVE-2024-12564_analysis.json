While CWE-200 describes the impact, CWE-276 better captures the root cause of the vulnerability. CWE-276 is also a child of CWE-732 (Incorrect or Incomplete Delegation of Privilege), which could be considered but is less specific than CWE-276.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe276[\"CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect or Incomplete Delegation of Privilege\"]\n\n    cwe276 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n    cwe200 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe276\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe276 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe732 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect default permissions (CWE-276)**, leading to the **exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200)** to unauthorized actors when the CDE server is installed with default settings.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description states that \"**Installing CDE Server with default settings** allows unauthorized users to visit prometheus metrics page,\" indicating a problem with the initial configuration of the server. This aligns with **CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions)**.\n\nThe reference summary states that the vulnerability type is \"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor,\" but CWE-200 is the impact, not the root cause. The root cause is the **incorrect default settings** that allowed unauthorized access. The **exposure of sensitive information** is a consequence of the **incorrect default permissions**.\n\nTherefore, **CWE-276** is the primary CWE because it represents the root cause, while **CWE-200** represents the resulting impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
