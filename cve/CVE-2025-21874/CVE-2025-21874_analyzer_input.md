# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-21874

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved dm-integrity **Avoid divide by zero** in table status in Inline mode In Inline mode, the journal is unused, and journal_sectors is zero. Calculating the journal watermark requires dividing by journal_sectors, which should be done only if the journal is configured. Otherwise, a simple table query (dmsetup table) can cause OOPS. This bug did not show on some systems, perhaps only due to compiler optimization. On my 32-bit testing machine, this reliably crashes with the following Oops divide error 0000
