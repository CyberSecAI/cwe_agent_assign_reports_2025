## Vulnerability Description
Develocity (formerly Gradle Enterprise) before 2024.3.1 allows an attacker who has network access to a Develocity server to obtain the hashed password of the system user. The hash algorithm used by Develocity was chosen according to best practices for password storage and provides some protection against brute-force attempts. The applicable severity of this vulnerability depends on whether a Develocity server is accessible by external or unauthorized users, and the complexity of the System User password.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **product:** Develocity
- **impact:** obtain the hashed password, obtain the System User password
- **attacker:** attacker who has network access
- **version:** before 2024.3.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
**Root cause of vulnerability:** A vulnerability in Develocity allows an attacker to obtain the hashed password of the "system" user.
**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Password hash information exposure.
**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain the hashed password of the "system" user.
**Attack vectors:** An attacker with network access to a Develocity server.
**Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network access to a Develocity server.
**Mitigation or fix:** Upgrade to Develocity 2024.1.9, 2024.2.7, 2024.3.1 or later. Change the password of the "system" user to a long and complex password.
