This allows unauthorized actors to gain knowledge about the system, which can potentially be used for further attacks. The chain is: **Information Disclosure** -> Exposure of System Information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description states that \"HCL MyXalytics is affected by sensitive **information disclosure vulnerability**. The HTTP response header exposes the Microsoft-HTTP API2.0 as the servers name & version.\" The primary **weakness** is the **information disclosure**.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a Class-level CWE that describes the **exposure of sensitive information** to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information. This CWE aligns with the general description of the vulnerability, where the Microsoft-HTTP API version is exposed in the HTTP response header. Although CWE-200 is discouraged, it's the highest-scored and most applicable Class-level CWE.\n\nCWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere) is a Base-level CWE that describes the product not properly preventing sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does. This is a more specific case of information exposure, as it focuses on system-level information.\n\nThe relationship between CWE-200 and CWE-497 is that CWE-497 is a child of CWE-200. This means that CWE-497 is a more specific type of CWE-200. The evidence supports using CWE-497 as a secondary CWE because the exposed information (Microsoft-HTTP API version) can be classified as sensitive system information.\n\nI considered other CWEs, such as CWE-201, CWE-212, and CWE-319, but they are not as applicable as CWE-200 and CWE-497. CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) is about sending sensitive data, but the vulnerability is about exposing existing information. CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer) is about not removing sensitive information before making it available, which is not the case here. CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is about transmitting sensitive data in cleartext, which is also not the case here.",
