  "description": "Tungsten Automation Power PDF JP2 File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Tungsten Automation Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JP2 files. The issue results from the ****lack of proper validation** of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-25567.",

The vulnerability description clearly states \"**Out-Of-Bounds Read**\" and that the issue results from the **'lack of proper validation of user-supplied data'**. This **lack of validation** allows for a read past the end of an allocated object.

The **'lack of proper validation'** directly contributes to the out-of-bounds read.
