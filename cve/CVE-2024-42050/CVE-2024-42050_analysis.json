  "description": "The MSI installer for Splashtop Streamer for Windows before 3.7.0.0 uses a temporary folder with **weak permissions** during installation. A local user can exploit this to escalate privileges to SYSTEM via an oplock on CredProvider_Inst.reg.",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe root cause is the use of a temporary folder with weak permissions by the Splashtop Streamer MSI installer during installation/reinstallation. This allows a local authenticated user to write to a file used in a SYSTEM context.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n*   **Weak Temporary Folder Permissions:** The MSI installer uses a temporary folder (within the user's `%TEMP%` directory) with permissions that allow write access to the current user.\n*   **Unprotected File Loading:** A `.reg` file (`CredProvider_Inst.reg`) is loaded from this user-writable folder during installation/reinstallation.\n*   **Race Condition:** The vulnerability exploits a race condition where an attacker can overwrite the `.reg` file after setting an oplock and before the file is loaded in the SYSTEM context.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Privilege Escalation:** By writing arbitrary content into the `.reg` file, the attacker can modify the registry under the `SYSTEM` context.\n*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Specifically, the attacker can create a `Debugger` value within the `Image File Execution Options` registry key to cause a SYSTEM process to execute an attacker-controlled binary.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the Windows machine.\n*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system.\n*   **Reinstallation Trigger:** The attacker triggers a reinstallation of the Splashtop Streamer using the original MSI installer.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   Local authenticated user account on the target Windows system.\n*   Ability to execute the Splashtop Streamer MSI installer (by having access to the installer or copying it back to its original location).\n*   Ability to set an oplock on a file and overwrite it before a specific action is performed on it by the system.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n*   The attacker uses an oplock to win the race condition and overwrite the `.reg` file before it is loaded by the installer.\n*   The specific method used for the privilege escalation is setting the `Debugger` value under `Image File Execution Options`, which allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary binary to be executed whenever the specified system binary is started.\n*   The vulnerability affects Splashtop Streamer for Windows versions prior to 3.7.0.0.",

CWE-379, \"Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions,\" is a more specific type of CWE-732, and is related as a child of CWE-377 (Temporary File Issues). CWE-363, \"Race Condition Enabling Link Following\", exists because the **weak permissions** allow for a race condition. The relationship between CWE-363 and CWE-59, where CWE-363 can precede CWE-59.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe379[\"CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions\"]\n    cwe363[\"CWE-363: Race Condition Enabling Link Following\"]\n    cwe59[\"CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\"]\n    \n    cwe379 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n    cwe363 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe59\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe732 primary\n    class cwe379,cwe363,cwe59 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect permissions** on the temporary folder (CWE-732), leading to the creation of a temporary file with **insecure permissions** (CWE-379). This allows a local user to exploit a race condition (CWE-363), ultimately escalating privileges to SYSTEM.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on the **weak permissions** root cause. The primary CWE, CWE-732, accurately reflects the **incorrect permission assignment** for a critical resource. The retriever results and relationship analysis supported this choice. The \"**weak permissions**\" are the main issue, allowing the local user to escalate privileges to SYSTEM. CWE-379 is a more precise description, but still stems from CWE-732. CWE-363 is present, because the **weak permissions** allowed for a race condition. The selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, addressing both the general permission issue and the specific context of temporary files.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nDuring installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
