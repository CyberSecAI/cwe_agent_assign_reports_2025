The more specific weaknesses, **Missing Authentication** CWE-306 and **Plaintext Storage of a Password** CWE-256, contribute to this exposure. Although CWE-200 is discouraged, it is suitable given the high-level information available in the description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe256 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing authentication** (CWE-306) allowing access to specific pages and database information. Then, **plaintext storage of credentials** (CWE-256) allows unauthenticated attackers to obtain administrator credentials. Both lead to **Exposure of Sensitive Information** (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment was based on the **weakness** described as \"**Exposure of Sensitive Information**.\" The retriever results pointed to CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor], CWE-532 [Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File], CWE-425 [Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')], and CWE-497 [Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere].\n\nCWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] is the most appropriate high-level classification, as the vulnerability description explicitly states \"**Exposure of Sensitive Information**.\" The description also mentions \"**unauthenticated attackers to view specific pages and obtain database information as well as plaintext administrator credentials**,\" supporting CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function] and CWE-256 [Plaintext Storage of a Password] as contributing factors.\n\nThe graph relationships highlight that CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function] and CWE-256 [Plaintext Storage of a Password] are children of CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor], indicating a hierarchical relationship where the specific weaknesses contribute to the broader exposure issue.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at a reasonable level of specificity, given the information provided. Although CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] is discouraged, it aligns with the explicit \"**weakness**\" mentioned in the description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- \"School Affairs System from Quanxun has an **Exposure of Sensitive Information**, allowing unauthenticated attackers to view specific pages and obtain database information as well as plaintext administrator credentials.\"\n\nI am overriding the discouragement for CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] because the vulnerability is explicitly described as \"**Exposure of Sensitive Information**\".",
