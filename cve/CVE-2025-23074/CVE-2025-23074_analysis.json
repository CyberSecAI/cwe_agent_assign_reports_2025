  "reference_content": "## CVE-2025-23074 Analysis\n\nThis content is directly related to CVE-2025-23074. It provides a detailed description of the vulnerability, its impact, and the fix.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe `Special:EditProfile` page in the SocialProfile extension does not respect the visibility settings (everyone/friends/friends of friends/hidden) of profile fields. This allows users with the `editothersprofiles` user right to view the contents of profile fields that should be hidden from them.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Information Leakage:** Privileged users can access sensitive information that they are not authorized to view.\n*   **Access Control Failure:** The application fails to enforce proper access control to profile data.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAn attacker with the `editothersprofiles` user right can view sensitive information from other users' profiles, even if those fields are marked as hidden. This could include personal details, contact information, or other private data.  The description also notes a potential issue where editing a hidden field with the `Special:EditProfile` page could overwrite the data, which is also undesirable.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n1.  An attacker must have the `editothersprofiles` user right.\n2.  The attacker navigates to `Special:EditProfile/User` for a target user.\n3.  The attacker can then view the contents of profile fields that should be hidden from them.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be a user with the `editothersprofiles` user right. This right is granted to members of a specific group.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe vulnerability was fixed by adding UserProfilePage-like visibility checks to the `Special:EditProfile` page.  The fix ensures that users only see profile fields that they are authorized to view, based on the field's visibility settings. The fix was implemented in Gerrit commits 1110835, 1111306, and 1111307 and merged into the `master`, `REL1_41`, and `REL1_42` branches of the `mediawiki/extensions/SocialProfile` repository.",

While less specific than a base or variant, it accurately reflects the high-level nature of the vulnerability - **exposure of sensitive information**. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is related, as the **exposure** happens because the application **fails to properly authorize** access to the sensitive profile data. Although CWE-863 is a contributing factor, the **impact** is the **exposure of the data**, making CWE-200 the more appropriate primary classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863), leading to the **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200). The **root cause** is the **missing or inadequate checks** on the `Special:EditProfile` page, which **allows users with elevated privileges (`editothersprofiles`) to access data they shouldn't be able to see**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-200 as the primary weakness, driven by the vulnerability description's emphasis on \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor.\" The retriever results support this, listing CWE-200 and related weaknesses like CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor) and CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data).\n\nThe analysis considered the relationship between the identified CWEs, specifically how **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863) directly **leads to the exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200). While CWE-863 is a contributing factor, the ultimate **impact** is the data **exposure**, making CWE-200 the more fitting primary classification.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity. While more specific CWEs exist, they don't fully capture the core issue of **unauthorized information disclosure**. The decision is based on the evidence provided, the retriever results, and the hierarchical relationships between the CWEs. The evidence clearly indicates a **failure in authorization**, leading to **sensitive information being exposed**, thus justifying the selection of CWE-200 and CWE-863.\n\nRelevant CWE
