# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-6868

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-6868

## Description

mudler/LocalAI version 2.17.1 allows for arbitrary file write due to **improper handling of automatic archive extraction**. When model configurations specify additional files as archives (e.g., .tar), these archives are automatically extracted after downloading. This behavior can be exploited to perform a tarslip attack, allowing files to be written to arbitrary locations on the server, bypassing checks that normally restrict files to the models directory. This vulnerability can lead to remote code execution (RCE) by overwriting backend assets used by the server.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** improper handling of automatic archive extraction
- **Impact:** ['arbitrary file write', 'remote code execution']
- **Vector:** tarslip attack
- **Product:** mudler/LocalAI
- **Version:** version 2.17.1

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-23 | Relative Path Traversal | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The **improper handling of automatic archive extraction** leads to the possibility of writing files to arbitrary locations due to path traversal. |
| CWE-434 | Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability involves the upload and automatic processing of archive files, which can be considered dangerous file types. |
| CWE-59 | Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The commit addresses a vulnerability related to symlink creation during the unarchiving process. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-23, as the core issue is writing files to arbitrary locations due to path traversal. CWE-434 and CWE-59 are related because the vulnerability involves uploading and processing dangerous archive files, which can lead to link following issues.

## Vulnerability Chain
1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper handling of automatic archive extraction** (CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal).
2.  The system automatically extracts archives after downloading, without properly sanitizing the file paths within the archive.
3.  This allows for a tarslip attack, where files can be written to arbitrary locations.
4.  **Impact:** Arbitrary file write, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment points to CWE-23 as the primary weakness, stemming from the **improper handling of automatic archive extraction** which leads to path traversal. The vulnerability description clearly states that the automatic extraction of archives is **improperly handled**, allowing for a tarslip attack to write files to arbitrary locations.

CWE-434 is included because the vulnerability involves uploading and processing dangerous archive files. The archives are automatically processed, which aligns with CWE-434's description of dangerous file types being automatically processed within the environment.

CWE-59 is a potential weakness due to the mention of symlink creation during the unarchiving process in the CVE reference. The commit addresses a vulnerability related to symlink creation during the unarchiving process, which could lead to path traversal vulnerabilities.

The evidence supports CWE-23 as the primary weakness, with CWE-434 and CWE-59 as contributing factors. All selected CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere. This could allow an attacker to cause the product to operate on unauthorized files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.
