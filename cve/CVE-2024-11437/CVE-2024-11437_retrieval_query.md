# Retrieval Query for CVE-2024-11437

# Vulnerability Description

    The Timeline Designer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the s parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.4 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis
    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. 
    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.
