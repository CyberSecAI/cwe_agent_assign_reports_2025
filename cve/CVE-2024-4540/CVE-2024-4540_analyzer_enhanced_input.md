## Vulnerability Description
A flaw was found in Keycloak in OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR). Client-provided parameters were found to be included in plain text in the KC_RESTART cookie returned by the authorization servers HTTP response to a `request_uri` authorization request, possibly leading to an **information disclosure vulnerability**.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **information disclosure vulnerability**
- **impact:** information disclosure
- **product:** Keycloak
- **component:** OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR)

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-4540:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the inclusion of client-provided parameters in plain text within the `KC_RESTART` cookie. This occurs during the processing of OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR) when a `request_uri` is used for authorization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information present in client-provided parameters is exposed in the `KC_RESTART` cookie.
- **Lack of Encryption/Obfuscation:** The parameters are not encrypted or obfuscated when stored in the cookie, leading to potential exposure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker who can intercept or access the `KC_RESTART` cookie could potentially obtain sensitive information, leading to:
- **Exposure of client data/parameters**
- **Potential for unauthorized access or further attacks.**

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Interception:** An attacker may intercept network traffic to capture the `KC_RESTART` cookie during the authorization process.
- **Cookie Access:** An attacker with access to the victim's browser cookies could obtain the sensitive parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Intercept Network Traffic:** The attacker needs the capability to intercept network requests to obtain the cookie.
- **Access to Browser Cookies:** The attacker needs to gain access to the victim's browser cookies.

**Affected Products:**
The vulnerability affects multiple Red Hat products, including:
- Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 (various RHEL versions)
- Red Hat build of Keycloak (versions 22.0.11 and 24.0.5)
- Red Hat Single Sign-On for OpenShift

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity by Red Hat.
- The fix involves updating Red Hat Single Sign-On and Red Hat build of Keycloak to versions where this issue is resolved.
- Red Hat has issued multiple security advisories (RHSA) to address this vulnerability in different products and versions.
- The provided content includes multiple RHSA's (RHSA-2024:3566, RHSA-2024:3567, RHSA-2024:3568, RHSA-2024:3570, RHSA-2024:3572, RHSA-2024:3573, RHSA-2024:3574, RHSA-2024:3575, RHSA-2024:3576) which all refer to the same underlying issue (CVE-2024-4540).

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
