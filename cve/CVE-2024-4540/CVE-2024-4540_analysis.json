  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-4540:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the inclusion of client-provided parameters in plain text within the `KC_RESTART` cookie. This occurs during the processing of OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR) when a `request_uri` is used for authorization.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information present in client-provided parameters is exposed in the `KC_RESTART` cookie.\n- **Lack of Encryption/Obfuscation:** The parameters are not encrypted or obfuscated when stored in the cookie, leading to potential exposure.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\nAn attacker who can intercept or access the `KC_RESTART` cookie could potentially obtain sensitive information, leading to:\n- **Exposure of client data/parameters**\n- **Potential for unauthorized access or further attacks.**\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network Interception:** An attacker may intercept network traffic to capture the `KC_RESTART` cookie during the authorization process.\n- **Cookie Access:** An attacker with access to the victim's browser cookies could obtain the sensitive parameters.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Ability to Intercept Network Traffic:** The attacker needs the capability to intercept network requests to obtain the cookie.\n- **Access to Browser Cookies:** The attacker needs to gain access to the victim's browser cookies.\n\n**Affected Products:**\nThe vulnerability affects multiple Red Hat products, including:\n- Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 (various RHEL versions)\n- Red Hat build of Keycloak (versions 22.0.11 and 24.0.5)\n- Red Hat Single Sign-On for OpenShift\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The vulnerability is rated as \"Low\" severity by Red Hat.\n- The fix involves updating Red Hat Single Sign-On and Red Hat build of Keycloak to versions where this issue is resolved.\n- Red Hat has issued multiple security advisories (RHSA) to address this vulnerability in different products and versions.\n- The provided content includes multiple RHSA's (RHSA-2024:3566, RHSA-2024:3567, RHSA-2024:3568, RHSA-2024:3570, RHSA-2024:3572, RHSA-2024:3573, RHSA-2024:3574, RHSA-2024:3575, RHSA-2024:3576) which all refer to the same underlying issue (CVE-2024-4540).",

This cookie is sent in the HTTP response, meaning that the parameters are being transmitted to another actor (the client). This aligns directly with CWE-201.\n**Confidence:** 0.9\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.90\n**Source**: graph\n**Description**: The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Justification:** This CWE applies because the application did not properly remove the sensitive client-provided parameters before including them in the `KC_RESTART` cookie.

CWE-201 is more specific as it details that the exposure occurs because the sensitive information is being sent in data. Therefore, CWE-201 is preferred.\n*   **CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication), CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key)**: These CWEs relate to authorization and authentication issues. While information disclosure can lead to authorization bypass, the **root cause** here is the **insertion of sensitive information** into the cookie, not a flaw in authorization or authentication mechanisms.\n*   **CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File)**: This is specific to log files, while the vulnerability involves a cookie. Therefore, it is not applicable.\n*   **CWE-472 (External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter)**: While the vulnerability does involve client-provided parameters, the core issue is not the external control of these parameters but their inclusion in the cookie.\n*   **CWE-226 (Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse)**: Similar to CWE-212, but the \"reuse\" aspect isn't strongly emphasized in the description.
