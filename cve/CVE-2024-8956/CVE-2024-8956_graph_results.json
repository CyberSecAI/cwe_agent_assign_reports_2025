The camera does not properly enforce authentication to /cgi-bin/param.cgi when requests are sent without an HTTP Authorization header. The result is a remote and unauthenticated attacker can leak sensitive data such as usernames, password hashes, and configurations details. Additionally, the attacker can update individual configuration values or overwrite the whole file.",
