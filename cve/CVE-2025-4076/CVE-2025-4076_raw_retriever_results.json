This affects the function easy_uci_set_option_string_0 of the file /cgi-bin/lighttpd.cgi of the component Password Handler. The manipulation of the argument routepwd leads to command injection. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
