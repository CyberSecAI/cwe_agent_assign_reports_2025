Affected by this vulnerability is the function cgi_s3 of the file /cgi-bin/s3.cgi of the component HTTP POST Request Handler. The manipulation of the argument f_a_key leads to **command injection**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. NOTE This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. NOTE Vendor was contacted early and confirmed that the product is end-of-life. It should be retired and replaced.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8130 (Note: This CVE ID is not mentioned in the provided documents, but the extracted vulnerability information is relevant and possibly related to other similar CVEs)\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   **Command Injection:** The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the `cgi_s3` function within the `/cgi-bin/s3.cgi` file. Specifically, the `f_a_key` variable, received through a POST request, is used in a `snprintf` function to construct a command. This command is then executed using the `system` command.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Unsanitized Input:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `f_a_key` variable. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands into the string that is passed to the `system` command.\n*   **Insecure System Call:** The use of the `system` function without proper input validation is inherently risky, as it directly executes shell commands, making it a prime target for command injection attacks.\n*   **Vulnerable CGI Script:** The CGI script `/cgi-bin/s3.cgi` is vulnerable because it directly processes unsanitized user input to execute system commands.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device's operating system with the privileges of the webserver process.\n*   **Complete System Compromise:** The ability to execute arbitrary commands can lead to a complete compromise of the device, allowing an attacker to gain control, potentially install malware, exfiltrate data, or disrupt services.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/cgi-bin/s3.cgi` with a malicious payload in the `f_a_key` parameter.\n*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exposed through the web configuration interface.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device to send the malicious HTTP POST request.\n*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable CGI script (`/cgi-bin/s3.cgi`) and the affected parameter (`f_a_key`).\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability affects several D-Link NAS devices, including DNS-320, DNS-320L, DNS-321, DNS-323, DNS-325, and DNS-327L.\n*   The vulnerable devices have reached their End of Life (EOL)/End of Service Life (EOS), meaning D-Link no longer provides software updates or security patches for these devices.\n\n**Summary of relevant information:**\n\n*   **Vulnerability:** Command Injection\n*   **Location:** `/cgi-bin/s3.cgi`\n*   **Parameter:** `f_a_key`\n*   **Affected Products:** D-Link DNS-320, DNS-320L, DNS-321, DNS-323, DNS-325, and DNS-327L NAS devices\n*   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution, potential system compromise\n*   **Mitigation:** D-Link recommends retiring and replacing the affected devices as they are no longer supported.",

CWE-78 is a more specific type of command injection, focusing on operating system commands. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions command injection related to OS commands, thus guiding the selection of CWE-78 as the primary classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of the `f_a_key` argument, leading to **command injection**, which then results in arbitrary command execution and potential system compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the provided CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The key phrase \"manipulation of the argument f_a_key leads to **command injection**\" directly points to command injection vulnerabilities. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further clarifies that the injected commands are OS commands.\n\nCWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')) is selected as the primary CWE because the **command injection** occurs specifically within the context of operating system commands. This is supported by the evidence that the injected commands are executed using the `system` command, which is used to execute OS commands. The retriever results also list CWE-78 as a strong candidate. The mapping guidance for CWE-78 allows its usage.\n\nCWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')) was also considered, but it's a more general case of command injection. Since the evidence points to OS commands, CWE-78 is the more specific and appropriate choice.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-78 is a Base level CWE and accurately reflects the nature of the vulnerability as OS Command Injection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
