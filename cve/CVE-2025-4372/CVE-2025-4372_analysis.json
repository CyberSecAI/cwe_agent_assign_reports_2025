There were no other competing relationships that would suggest another classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe416 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **use after free** condition (CWE-416) in WebAudio, which leads to **heap corruption**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a **use after free** in WebAudio. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this as the root cause. The description directly mentions \"Use after free in WebAudio\". This maps directly to CWE-416.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-416 as the top match, further supporting this classification. The confidence is high due to the direct match and supporting evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-416: Use After Free\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reuses or references memory after it has been freed.
