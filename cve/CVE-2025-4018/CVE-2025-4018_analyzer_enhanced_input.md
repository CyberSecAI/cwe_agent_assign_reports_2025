## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| **Indicator**                                              | **Likely CWE** |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| No identity check (no login)                               | CWE-306        |
| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
