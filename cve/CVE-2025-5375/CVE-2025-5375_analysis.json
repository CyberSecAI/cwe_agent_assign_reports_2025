  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE Content\n\nThis content **relates** to a potential vulnerability, but it is a report of a vulnerability found by a researcher and published on GitHub, not an official CVE record. The CVE ID (CVE-2025-5375) appears to be a placeholder as the description is missing. This report details a SQL injection vulnerability in phpgurukul Online Birth Certificate System Project V2.0.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the information provided:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of user input for the \"del\" parameter in the `/admin/registered-users.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Data leakage\n*   Data tampering/deletion\n*   Potential system control compromise\n*   Disruption of services\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   HTTP GET request parameter manipulation: specifically, the \"del\" parameter in `/admin/registered-users.php`.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is explicitly mentioned as being required to access the vulnerable parameter.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Prepared statements and parameter binding:**  Using prepared statements separates SQL code from user data, preventing injection.\n*   **Input validation and filtering:**  Validating and filtering user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats.\n*   **Minimize database user permissions:**  Using database accounts with the least necessary privileges.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description would likely contain):**\n\n*   **Payload Example:** `del=5';SELECT SLEEP(5) AND 'QNzB'='QNzB`\n*   **Vulnerability Request Packet:** A full HTTP GET request example is provided.\n*   **Proof of Concept:**  Demonstration using `sqlmap` with screenshots showing database enumeration.\n*   **Software Link:** A link to download the vulnerable software.\n*   **Affected Version:** V2.0\n*   **Vendor Homepage:** Link to the vendor's website.",

It is a child of CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') and CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection'). CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting) is a peer vulnerability that involves improper neutralization, but for web page generation instead of SQL commands.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe79 -->|PEEROF| cwe89\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe74,cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of the `del` parameter in the `/admin/registered-users.php` file, leading to **SQL Injection**. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized database access, data leakage, or data manipulation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary weakness is clearly **SQL Injection**, due to the **improper neutralization** of the `del` parameter.\n\nThe evidence for CWE-89 is very strong:\n*   The **Vulnerability Description** states: \"The manipulation of the argument del leads to **sql injection**.\"\n*   The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms: \"The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of user input for the \"del\" parameter in the `/admin/registered-users.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries.\" Also \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection\"\n*   The **Retriever Results** list CWE-89 as the top match with a score of 1.000.\n\nCWE-79 was considered as a secondary weakness, but there is no evidence that this vulnerability leads to Cross-site Scripting.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 as the primary CWE is appropriate because it accurately reflects the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an SQL command. The other CWEs were considered, but they did not match the vulnerability description as closely as CWE-89.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.98\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-87\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-86\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-85\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-84\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-83",
