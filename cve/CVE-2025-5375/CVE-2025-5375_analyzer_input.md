## Analysis of CVE Content

This content **relates** to a potential vulnerability, but it is a report of a vulnerability found by a researcher and published on GitHub, not an official CVE record. The CVE ID (CVE-2025-5375) appears to be a placeholder as the description is missing. This report details a SQL injection vulnerability in phpgurukul Online Birth Certificate System Project V2.0.

Here's a breakdown of the information provided:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of user input for the "del" parameter in the `/admin/registered-users.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Data leakage
*   Data tampering/deletion
*   Potential system control compromise
*   Disruption of services

**Attack vectors:**

*   HTTP GET request parameter manipulation: specifically, the "del" parameter in `/admin/registered-users.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is explicitly mentioned as being required to access the vulnerable parameter.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Prepared statements and parameter binding:**  Using prepared statements separates SQL code from user data, preventing injection.
*   **Input validation and filtering:**  Validating and filtering user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats.
*   **Minimize database user permissions:**  Using database accounts with the least necessary privileges.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description would likely contain):**

*   **Payload Example:** `del=5';SELECT SLEEP(5) AND 'QNzB'='QNzB`
*   **Vulnerability Request Packet:** A full HTTP GET request example is provided.
*   **Proof of Concept:**  Demonstration using `sqlmap` with screenshots showing database enumeration.
*   **Software Link:** A link to download the vulnerable software.
*   **Affected Version:** V2.0
*   **Vendor Homepage:** Link to the vendor's website.
