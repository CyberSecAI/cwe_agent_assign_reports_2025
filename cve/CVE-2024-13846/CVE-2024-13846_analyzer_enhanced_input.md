# Vulnerability Description

    The Indeed Ultimate Learning Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **time-based SQL Injection** via the post_id parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.9 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
