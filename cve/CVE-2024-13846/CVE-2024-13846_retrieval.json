    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    The Indeed Ultimate Learning Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **time-based SQL Injection** via the post_id parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.9 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
