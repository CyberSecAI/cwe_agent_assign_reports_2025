This is a base-level CWE that directly addresses the core issue described in the vulnerability. It has parent CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and peer relationship with CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of authentication** for a critical function (CWE-306), which directly leads to the ability to bypass authentication.\n  - Root Cause: CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function)\n  - Impact: Authentication Bypass\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that it can be exploited to bypass authentication. The key phrase is **\"bypass authentication\"**. Based on the CWE Classification Guidance, especially the section on \"Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control\", the most appropriate CWE is CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). This CWE is specifically used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-306 as a potential candidate. While other CWEs like CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and CWE-305 (Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness) are related, CWE-306 is the most specific and directly addresses the **lack of authentication**.\n\nThe CWE Classification Guidance states:\n\n*   **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* \u2013 used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).\n\nThe given vulnerability perfectly matches this description, leading to a confident classification of CWE-306.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This CWE is about relying on untrusted inputs, but the vulnerability is about the **lack of authentication**.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This CWE is about an incorrect implementation, but the vulnerability is about the **lack of authentication**.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* This CWE is about the use of weak credentials, but the vulnerability is about the **lack of authentication**.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This CWE is about externally controllable parameters, but the vulnerability is about the **lack of authentication**.\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This CWE is about an alternate path.
