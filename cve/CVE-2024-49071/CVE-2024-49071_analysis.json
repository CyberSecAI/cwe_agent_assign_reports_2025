This choice is influenced by its direct relevance to the vulnerability description. CWE-612 is a child of CWE-1230 (Improper Handling of Index/Range/Offset) and has a parent relationship to itself, indicating its focus on indexing issues.\n\nCWE-201, considered as a secondary candidate, relates to the insertion of sensitive information into sent data, which is a possible consequence of the improper authorization.\n\nCWE-497, also a secondary candidate, deals with the exposure of sensitive system information, which aligns with the described impact of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe612[\"CWE-612: Improper Authorization of Index Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe1230[\"CWE-1230: Improper Handling of Index/Range/Offset\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe612 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1230\n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe612\n    cwe497 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe612\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe612 primary\n    class cwe201,cwe497 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper authorization** (CWE-612) of an index containing sensitive information. This leads to the potential insertion of sensitive information into sent data (CWE-201) and, ultimately, the disclosure of information over a network.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary CWE selection is based on the vulnerability description's explicit mention of \"**improper authorization**\" in the context of a \"Global Files search\" that allows an attacker to \"disclose information over a network.\" The phrase \"**Improper authorization** of an index that contains sensitive information\" directly maps to CWE-612.\n\nCWE-284, CWE-285, CWE-862 and CWE-863 were considered, but determined to be less specific. CWE-284 is a pillar level CWE and is too general. CWE-285 is a class level CWE and is also too general. CWE-862 and CWE-863 both relate to missing or incorrect authorization, but CWE-612 is more specific to the context of an index containing sensitive information.\n\nCWE-201 and CWE-497 are considered as secondary candidates because they represent potential impacts or related weaknesses stemming from the primary authorization issue. They are not the root cause, but contribute to the overall understanding of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately reflect the root cause and potential impacts of the vulnerability, based on the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
