## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
CVE-2025-26263 - GeoVision ASManager Windows desktop application with the version 6.1.2.0 or less, is vulnerable to credentials disclosure due to improper memory handling in the ASManagerService.exe process.

Root cause of vulnerability:
*   Improper memory handling in the ASManagerService.exe process.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
*   Credentials disclosure.

Impact of exploitation:
*   An attacker with high privilege system user, who isn't authorized to access GeoVision ASManager, is able to dump ASManager accounts credentials and authenticate in ASManager.
*   After authenticating in ASManager, an attacker will be able to access the resources such as monitoring cameras, access cards, parking cars, employees and visitors, etc.
*   Make changes in data and service network configurations such as employees, access card security information, IP addresses and configurations, etc.
*   Disrupt and disconnect services such as monitoring cameras, access controls.
*   Clone and duplicate access control data for further attack scenarios.

Attack vectors:
*   The attacker needs System level access to the GV-ASManager windows desktop application with the version 6.1.2.0 or less.
*   The attacker needs a high privilege account to dump the memory.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
*   System level access.
*   A high privilege account.

Additional Details:
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by dumping credentials from memory.
*   Credentials leakage in memory can be dumped and found with two methods:
    *   Account which has been authenticated in the software at least once.
    *   Account has never been authenticated in the software, but an attacker is able to trigger memory allocation by triggering it with "Forget Password?" function.
