# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2025-26263

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-226 | Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE - Root cause is **improper memory handling** resulting in credentials disclosure |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE - Impact is sensitive information exposure, but this is a high-level class. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the parent-child relationship. CWE-226 is at the Base level of abstraction, making it a more suitable choice than its parent classes. CWE-200 was also considered, but is discouraged as it represents the impact rather than the root cause.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper memory handling** (CWE-226), which leads to the disclosure of credentials, resulting in exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on the **improper memory handling** as the root cause leading to credentials disclosure. The primary CWE selected, CWE-226, directly addresses the **failure to remove sensitive information before reuse**, which aligns with the vulnerability description stating **improper memory handling** led to credentials being exposed. CWE-200 was considered due to the impact of credentials disclosure. However, CWE-200 is a high-level class representing the impact of the vulnerability rather than the root cause. The final decision favors CWE-226 for its specific description of the memory handling issue and its base abstraction level.

The vulnerability description states: "GeoVision ASManager Windows desktop application with the version 6.1.2.0 or less (fixed in 6.2.0), is vulnerable to credentials disclosure due to **improper memory handling** in the ASManagerService.exe process." This statement and the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** entry stating "**rootcause:** **improper memory handling**" directly supports the root cause assessment.

### Analysis of other CWEs Considered but not Used:

*   **CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**: While **improper memory handling** might suggest a buffer overflow, the description focuses on the presence of sensitive data in memory rather than an overflow condition. Therefore, CWE-119 is less appropriate.
*   **CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**: This CWE describes the impact of the vulnerability (credentials disclosure) rather than the root cause (**improper memory handling**).
*   **CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write**: Similar to CWE-119, this relates to memory corruption, which isn't the core issue described.
*   **CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read**: Similar to CWE-119 and CWE-787, this relates to memory corruption, which isn't the core issue described.
*   **CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource**: This CWE focuses on incorrect permission assignments. While the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to resources after exploitation, the initial cause is related to **improper memory handling** rather than a permission issue.
