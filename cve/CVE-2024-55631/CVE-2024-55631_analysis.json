  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-55631:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- An engine link following vulnerability.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Improper privilege management (CWE-269). Specifically, the vulnerability stems from how Trend Micro Apex One handles links related to its engine component.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- A local attacker can escalate their privileges on the affected system. This means an attacker with low-level access can gain higher-level privileges, potentially allowing them to perform actions they wouldn't normally be authorized to do, such as gaining complete control over the system.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Local access is required. The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system with low-level privileges.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. This could be achieved through various means, such as exploiting another vulnerability or gaining access through compromised credentials.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- The vulnerability is identified as ZDI-CAN-23995.\n- The vulnerability has a CVSSv3 score of 7.8 with a vector of AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.\n- This vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities addressed in the December 2024 security bulletin for Trend Micro Apex One.\n- The specific nature of the \"engine link following\" is not detailed.",
