## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability has been identified in Simcenter Femap (All versions < V2406). The affected applications contain an **out of bounds read** past the end of an allocated structure while parsing specially crafted BMP files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read during the parsing of specially crafted BMP files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125): The application attempts to read data beyond the allocated memory region.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is the potential for arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process. This could allow an attacker to gain control of the affected application or system. The provided CVSS scores also indicate a high potential impact (confidentiality, integrity, availability).

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a local one (AV:L), requiring the attacker to have access to the local system.
- The user must be tricked into opening a malicious BMP file (UI:R - user interaction required).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious BMP file to the user of the affected application.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious BMP file using the vulnerable software.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions that this is one of multiple vulnerabilities affecting the Simcenter Femap software related to different file formats.
- The provided CVSS v3.1 and v4.0 scores are 7.8 and 7.3 respectively, highlighting the severity of the vulnerability.
- The mitigation is to avoid opening untrusted BMP files.
