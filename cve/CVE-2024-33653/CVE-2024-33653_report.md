# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-33653

## Description

A vulnerability has been identified in Simcenter Femap (All versions < V2406). The affected applications contain an **out of bounds read** past the end of an allocated structure while parsing specially crafted BMP files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the parsing of a specially crafted BMP file, leading to an **out-of-bounds read**, which can then lead to arbitrary code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is an **out-of-bounds read** that occurs when parsing a specially crafted BMP file. The vulnerability description explicitly states "**out of bounds read past the end of an allocated structure**". The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section also confirms the root cause as an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125 [CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read]).

CWE-125 [CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read] is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level. The retriever results list CWE-125 [CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read] and CWE-787 [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write] with high scores. However, the description clearly indicates a read operation, not a write operation.

CWE-787 [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write] was considered due to its high score in the "Top CWEs" and "Retriever Results", and its selection as the "Primary CWE Match" in the CWE for similar CVE Descriptions section. However, the vulnerability description specifically mentions an **out-of-bounds read**, making CWE-125 [CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read] the more accurate choice.


## CWE Relationship Analysis

Current CWEs represent these abstraction levels: .
