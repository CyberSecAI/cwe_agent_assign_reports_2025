# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-12366

## Vulnerability Description
PandasAI uses an interactive prompt function that is vulnerable to **prompt injection** and run arbitrary Python code that can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) instead of the intended explanation of the natural language processing by the LLM.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's an analysis of the provided content, focusing on information relevant to CVE-2024-12366, based on the official description (which is a placeholder and not provided):

Since the CVE description is not provided, I will analyze the content for any information related to prompt injection vulnerabilities, as the content appears to be related to prompt injection attacks.

**Content from www.kb.cert.org_0cc488cc_20250624_121117.html (text)**

*   **Relevance:** This content directly addresses CVE-2024-12366.
*   **Vulnerability:** PandasAI is vulnerable to Prompt Injection attacks.
*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The security controls of PandasAI (2.4.3 and earlier) fail to distinguish between legitimate and malicious inputs, allowing attackers to manipulate the system into executing untrusted code.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution (RCE), system compromise, or pivoting attacks on connected services.
*   **Attack vector:** Crafting malicious input that is interpreted as code.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Access to the chat prompt.
*   **Mitigation or fix:**
    *   SinaptikAI has introduced a Security parameter to the configuration file of the PandasAI project.
    *   Users can select one of three security configurations: Standard, Advanced, or None.
    *   SinaptikAI has also released a sandbox.

*   **Relevance:** The content is related to prompt injection attacks, but does not specifically reference the CVE.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** LLMs consume both trusted system prompts and untrusted user inputs as natural language, which means that they cannot distinguish between commands and inputs based on data type.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Steal sensitive data, spread misinformation, or worse.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Hackers disguise malicious content as benign user input and feed it to an LLM application.
    *   Hiding malicious prompts in websites and messages that LLMs consume.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No specific technical expertise is needed.
*   **Mitigation or fix:**
    *   Validating inputs
    *   Closely monitoring LLM activity
    *   Keeping human users in the loop
    *   Timely updates and patching
    *   Training users to spot prompts hidden in malicious emails and websites
    *   Monitoring and response tools
    *   Parameterization
    *   Input validation and sanitization
    *   Output filtering
    *   Strengthening internal prompts
    *   Least privilege
    *   Human in the loop

*   **Relevance:** The content is related to prompt injection attacks, but does not specifically reference the CVE.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Prompt injection attacks occur when malicious users craft their input to manipulate the AI into providing incorrect or harmful outputs.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Data Exposure and Privacy Breaches
    *   System Manipulation and Unauthorized Actions
    *   Malicious Content Generation
    *   Financial Fraud and Scams
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Direct prompt injections
    *   Indirect prompt injections
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Malicious users.
*   **Mitigation or fix:**
    *   Secure Prompt Engineering
    *   Rate Limiting and Anomaly Detection
    *   Sandboxing and Isolation Techniques
    *   Continuous Monitoring and Logging
    *   Input Validation and Sanitization

*   **Relevance:** The content is related to prompt injection attacks, but does not specifically reference the CVE.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Attackers manipulate the input to an AI model to cause it to execute unintended actions or reveal sensitive information.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Data leakage, Offensive content & misinformation, Model manipulation.
*   **Attack vectors:** Manipulating the input to an AI model.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Adversaries.
*   **Mitigation or fix:**
    *   Validate and Sanitize Inputs
    *   Test Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    *   Prioritize Security From The Outset
    *   Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
