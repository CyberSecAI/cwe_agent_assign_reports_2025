# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-5151

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in defog-ai introspect up to 0.1.4. This affects the function execute_analysis_code_safely of the file introspect/backend/tools/analysis_tools.py. The manipulation of the argument code leads to **code injection**. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The patch is named 502. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The code maintainer explains, that [they] have added some workarounds to address this in #502, but will not be implementing a full fix. This is because this repo is meant to be run in a docker environment, which will significantly mitigate potential security risks. Having said that, we have added a SECURITY section in our README to make this clearer to users.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **code injection**
- **vector:** manipulation of the argument code
- **product:** defog-ai introspect
- **version:** up to 0.1.4
- **component:** execute_analysis_code_safely of the file introspect/backend/tools/analysis_tools.py

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The `execute_analysis_code_safely` function directly executes user-provided code using the `exec` function.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
CWE-94: Code Injection.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can potentially access and manipulate libraries to perform unauthorized actions, such as reading sensitive files (e.g., /etc/passwd), modifying system configurations, or performing malicious network operations.

Attack vectors:
The attacker can provide malicious code as the `code` parameter when calling the `execute_analysis_code_safely` function.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
An attacker needs to be able to provide the `code` parameter to the `execute_analysis_code_safely` function.

Mitigation or fix:
The provided content references a fix in pull request #502 which includes restricting builtins and imports when executing analysis code and validating user supplied code using `ast`.
