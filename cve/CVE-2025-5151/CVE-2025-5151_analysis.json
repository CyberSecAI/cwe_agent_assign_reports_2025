  "description": "A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in defog-ai introspect up to 0.1.4. This affects the function execute_analysis_code_safely of the file introspect/backend/tools/analysis_tools.py. The manipulation of the argument code leads to **code injection**. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The patch is named 502. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The code maintainer explains, that [they] have added some workarounds to address this in #502, but will not be implementing a full fix. This is because this repo is meant to be run in a docker environment, which will significantly mitigate potential security risks. Having said that, we have added a SECURITY section in our README to make this clearer to users.",

The `execute_analysis_code_safely` function directly executes user-provided code using the `exec` function. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the decision is the direct match of the vulnerability description to the characteristics of CWE-94. CWE-94 is a base-level CWE, providing a good level of specificity for the **code injection** vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe94 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-94 - Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'). The `execute_analysis_code_safely` function allows arbitrary code execution via the `exec` function.\n2.  **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, such as reading sensitive files, modifying system configurations, or performing malicious network operations.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which explicitly states \"CWE-94: Code Injection.\" The vulnerability description also clearly indicates **code injection** as the weakness. The function `execute_analysis_code_safely` directly executes user-provided code using the `exec` function, which aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-94. The provided content also states that \"The attacker can provide malicious code as the `code` parameter when calling the `execute_analysis_code_safely` function.\" The suggested mitigations in pull request #502 which includes restricting builtins and imports when executing analysis code and validating user supplied code using `ast`. This fix strategy also supports the assessment that CWE-94 is the correct classification.\n\nThe graph relationships are simple in this case. The selection of CWE-94 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g. \"eval\").\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*CWE-95 was considered but is less appropriate than CWE-94. While the vulnerability involves dynamic evaluation, CWE-94 is a broader category encompassing various forms of **code injection**, while CWE-95 specifically focuses on 'Eval Injection'.*\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*CWE-1286 was considered but is not the primary weakness. Although input validation is related, the core issue is the execution of arbitrary code, which is better captured by CWE-94.*\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*CWE-497 was considered but is an impact of the vulnerability. The root cause is the **code injection**, not the information exposure itself.*\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*CWE-74 was considered, but it is too high-level. CWE-94 provides a more specific classification for **code injection**.*\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*CWE-212 was considered, but it's not relevant to the described vulnerability.*\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*CWE-88 was considered, but it refers to argument injection, which is not the case here.*\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*CWE-116 was considered, but it's not relevant to the described vulnerability.*\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*CWE-346 was considered, but it's not relevant to the described vulnerability.*\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*CWE-184 was considered, but it's not relevant to the described vulnerability.*\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might",
