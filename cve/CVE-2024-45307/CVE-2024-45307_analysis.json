  "description": "SudoBot, a Discord moderation bot, is vulnerable to privilege escalation and exploit of the `-config` command in versions prior to 9.26.7. Anyone is theoretically able to update any configuration of the bot and potentially gain control over the bots settings. Every version of v9 before v9.26.7 is affected. Other versions (e.g. v8) are not affected. Users should upgrade to version 9.26.7 to receive a patch. A workaround would be to create a command permission overwrite in the Database. A SQL statement provided in the GitHub Security Advisor can be executed to create a overwrite that disallows users without `ManageGuild` permission to run the `-config` command. Run the SQL statement for every server the bot is in, and replace `` with the appropriate Guild ID each time.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content relates to CVE-2024-45307.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `-config` command of the `sudobot`. This allows any user, regardless of their permissions, to execute the command and modify the bot's configuration.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Improper authorization: The `-config` command lacks a check to ensure that only authorized users (e.g., those with `ManageGuild` permissions) can execute it.\n- Privilege escalation: Unauthorized users can modify the bot's configuration, potentially gaining control over the bot.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Privilege escalation: Attackers can gain control over the bot's settings by modifying the configuration.\n-  The bot's functionality can be altered by changing configuration values.\n-  Potential for other attacks depending on how the bot's configuration is utilized.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Network: The attack vector is network-based, meaning that the attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker does not need any privileges to exploit this vulnerability.\n- The attacker needs to interact with the bot via the `-config` command.\n\n**Additional information:**\n- The vulnerability is fixed in version 9.26.7 of the bot. Users are advised to update to this version, or v10.\n- A workaround using an SQL query that creates a command permission overwrite in the database is also provided as a temporary solution.\n- The vulnerability has a high severity rating with a CVSS score of 8.8.\n- The vulnerability has the following CVSS v3.1 vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:H\n- The related CWEs are CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).\n- The provided commit `ef46ca9` fixes the vulnerability by adding a `PermissionFlags.ManageGuild` check to the command.",

Since the vulnerability description states a **missing authorization** check, **CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]** is more accurate. **CWE-269 [Improper Privilege Management]**, a Class level CWE, is too general and discouraged by MITRE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|PEEROF| cwe863\n    cwe863 -->|ChildOf| cwe285\n    cwe269 -->|PEEROF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe269,cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check (**CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]**) in the `-config` command. This allows unauthorized users to modify the bot's configuration, leading to privilege escalation. The impact is that attackers can gain control over the bot's settings.\n- Root Cause: **CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]**\n- Impact: Privilege escalation, unauthorized configuration changes.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The key evidence is the statement that the vulnerability stems from a **missing authorization** check in the `-config` command. This directly corresponds to **CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]**. While other CWEs like **CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization]** and **CWE-269 [Improper Privilege Management]** were considered, they were deemed less accurate or too general based on the specific details of the vulnerability. The choice of **CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]** is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately reflects the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
