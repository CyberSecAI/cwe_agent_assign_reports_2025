  "query": "Harman Becker MGU21 Bluetooth Improper Input Validation Denial-of-Service Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to create a denial-of-service condition on affected installations of Harman Becker MGU21 devices. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the Bluetooth stack of the BCM89359 chipset. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of Bluetooth frames. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to create a denial-of-service condition on the system. Was ZDI-CAN-23942.",
