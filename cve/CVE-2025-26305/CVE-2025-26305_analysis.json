  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-26305 Content\n\nThe provided content details a memory leak vulnerability in `libming` version 0.4.8.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nMemory allocated for `EnvelopeRecords` within the `parseSWF_SOUNDINFO` function in `util/parser.c` is not freed after use. This occurs when parsing SWF sound information containing envelope data.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Memory Leak: Failure to release allocated memory.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nA memory leak can lead to increased memory consumption over time, potentially causing the application to slow down or crash, especially when processing many SWF files.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Processing a specially crafted SWF file containing envelope data.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to provide a SWF file to the application using `libming` to trigger the vulnerability. No special privileges are required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not provide a specific fix, but implies that freeing the allocated memory for `EnvelopeRecords` within the `parseSWF_SOUNDINFO` function would resolve the issue.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\nThe content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including:\n\n*   Specific file and function name where the vulnerability exists (`util/parser.c`, `parseSWF_SOUNDINFO`).\n*   Code snippet illustrating the vulnerable allocation.\n*   ASAN (AddressSanitizer) output confirming the memory leak.\n*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) available as a zip file.\n*   Affected version (`libming v0.4.8`).",
