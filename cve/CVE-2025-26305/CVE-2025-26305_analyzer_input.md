# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-26305

## Vulnerability Description
A **memory leak** has been identified in the parseSWF_SOUNDINFO function in util/parser.c of libming v0.4.8, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted SWF file.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **memory leak**
- **impact:** denial of service
- **vector:** crafted SWF file
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** libming
- **version:** v0.4.8
- **component:** parseSWF_SOUNDINFO function in util/parser.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-26305 Content

The provided content details a memory leak vulnerability in `libming` version 0.4.8.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

Memory allocated for `EnvelopeRecords` within the `parseSWF_SOUNDINFO` function in `util/parser.c` is not freed after use. This occurs when parsing SWF sound information containing envelope data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Memory Leak: Failure to release allocated memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**

A memory leak can lead to increased memory consumption over time, potentially causing the application to slow down or crash, especially when processing many SWF files.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Processing a specially crafted SWF file containing envelope data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to provide a SWF file to the application using `libming` to trigger the vulnerability. No special privileges are required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not provide a specific fix, but implies that freeing the allocated memory for `EnvelopeRecords` within the `parseSWF_SOUNDINFO` function would resolve the issue.

**Additional Details:**

The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including:

*   Specific file and function name where the vulnerability exists (`util/parser.c`, `parseSWF_SOUNDINFO`).
*   Code snippet illustrating the vulnerable allocation.
*   ASAN (AddressSanitizer) output confirming the memory leak.
*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) available as a zip file.
*   Affected version (`libming v0.4.8`).
