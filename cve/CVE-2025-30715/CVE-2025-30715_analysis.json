Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server.

This CWE is a base-level weakness. A related Class-level CWE is CWE-400, **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')**, which is a parent of CWE-770. The vulnerability description mentions \"cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server\", indicating a denial-of-service condition due to resource exhaustion. The relationship between CWE-770 and CWE-400 is that CWE-770 can lead to CWE-400.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a high-privileged attacker gaining network access via multiple protocols, leading to **allocation of resources without limits or throttling** (CWE-770), which ultimately results in a hang or crash of the MySQL server due to **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400), causing a denial-of-service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the vulnerability description, the primary weakness is the **uncontrolled allocation of resources**, which leads to a denial-of-service. CWE-770, **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**, is the most appropriate CWE to represent this weakness, as it directly addresses the root cause. The description includes the phrase \"cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server\", supporting this assessment. CWE-400, **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**, represents the impact (denial of service).\n\nThe retriever results listed CWE-770 with a score of 0.139 which supports the assessment.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-20 (**Improper Input Validation**): While input validation issues can contribute to resource exhaustion, the primary issue here is the **lack of limits on resource allocation**, making CWE-770 a more direct fit.\n*   CWE-89 (**Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')**): SQL injection is not indicated in the description.\n*   CWE-129 (**Improper Validation of Array Index**): Array index validation is not indicated in the description.\n*   CWE-173 (**Improper Handling of Alternate Encoding**): Alternate encoding issues are not indicated in the description.\n* CWE-190 (**Integer Overflow or Wraparound**): Integer overflow issues are not indicated in the description.\n* CWE-1284 (**Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input**): Improper validation of input quantity issues are not indicated in the description.\n\nThe selection of CWE-770 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the **uncontrolled allocation of resources**.",
