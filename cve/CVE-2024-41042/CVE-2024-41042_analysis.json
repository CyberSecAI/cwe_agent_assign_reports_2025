  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved netfilter nf_tables prefer nft_chain_validate nft_chain_validate already performs loop detection because a cycle will result in a call **stack overflow** (ctx->level >= NFT_JUMP_STACK_SIZE). It also follows maps via ->validate callback in nft_lookup, so there appears no reason to iterate the maps again. nf_tables_check_loops() and all its helper functions can be removed. This improves ruleset load time significantly, from 23s down to 12s. This also fixes a crash bug. Old loop detection code can result in **unbounded recursion** BUG TASK stack guard page was hit at .... Oops stack guard page 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN CPU 4 PID 1539 Comm nft Not tainted 6.10.0-rc5+ #1 [..] with a suitable ruleset during validation of register stores. I cant see any actual reason to attempt to check for this from nft_validate_register_store(), at this point the transaction is still in progress, so we dont have a full picture of the rule graph. For nf-next it might make sense to either remove it or make this depend on table->validate_state in case we could catch an error earlier (for improved error reporting to userspace).",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from an inefficient and flawed implementation of loop detection in the Linux kernel's `nf_tables` subsystem. The old loop detection code, specifically `nf_tables_check_loops()` and its related functions, attempted to recursively traverse chains and sets to identify potential loops during ruleset validation. This approach was redundant and could lead to unbounded recursion when processing certain crafted rulesets, ultimately resulting in a stack overflow.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n1.  **Unbounded Recursion:** The primary weakness was the potential for unbounded recursion in the loop detection mechanism. When a ruleset contained complex chains and jumps, the recursive nature of `nf_tables_check_loops()` could exceed the stack limit, leading to a kernel crash.\n2.  **Inefficient Loop Detection:** The original loop detection mechanism was inefficient because it duplicated functionality already present in `nft_chain_validate`. It redundantly iterated through maps and chains.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Kernel Crash (Denial of Service):** A carefully crafted ruleset could be loaded into the kernel's `nf_tables` subsystem, triggering the unbounded recursion. This would result in a stack overflow and a kernel crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition on the affected system.\n*   **Slow Ruleset Load Times:** The old implementation also led to significantly longer ruleset load times.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Ruleset Loading:** The primary attack vector is through loading a malicious nftables ruleset via the `nft` command-line tool or any other method for configuring netfilter rules.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Privileged Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to load netfilter rules into the kernel, which typically requires root privileges or capabilities.\n*   **Ruleset Crafting Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of how to construct specific rulesets that can trigger the unbounded recursion.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n*   The fix replaces the vulnerable loop detection with calls to `nft_chain_validate`, which already performs loop detection and has a limit to prevent unbounded recursion.\n*   The fix also significantly improves ruleset loading time by removing the unnecessary iteration of maps.\n\nIn summary, the vulnerability was caused by a flawed and inefficient loop detection implementation in the netfilter subsystem, leading to a denial-of-service vulnerability via stack overflow when loading specially crafted rulesets. The fix replaces the faulty loop detection with an existing function and removes the vulnerable code.",
