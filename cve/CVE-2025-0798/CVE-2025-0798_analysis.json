  "description": "A vulnerability was found in MicroWorld eScan Antivirus 7.0.32 on Linux. It has been rated as critical. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file rtscanner of the component Quarantine Handler. The manipulation leads to **os command injection**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

While other CWEs like CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')) are related, CWE-78 is more specific as it explicitly mentions OS commands. CWE-78 is a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')), which represents a broader class of injection vulnerabilities, but is discouraged.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe77 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of special elements within the rtscanner component of eScan Antivirus, leading to **OS command injection**. This allows for remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description which clearly states \"**os command injection**\". The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-78 as the most appropriate mapping with a score of 1.0. The vulnerability description key phrases also highlight \"os command injection\". All evidence points towards CWE-78 as the primary root cause.
