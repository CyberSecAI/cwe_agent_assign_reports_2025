  "description": "A vulnerability has been found in viames Pair Framework up to 1.9.11 and classified as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is the function getCookieContent of the file /src/UserRemember.php of the component PHP Object Handler. The manipulation of the argument cookieName leads to **deserialization**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "Here's an analysis of the provided content:\n\n*   **Relevance:** The content directly relates to a PHP Object Injection vulnerability in the Pair Framework. This aligns with the potential for vulnerabilities that could be described in CVE-2025-2376.\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from the deserialization of untrusted data. Specifically, Pair Framework uses `unserialize()` on the contents of a cookie without proper validation, allowing for object injection.\n\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is PHP Object Injection (CWE-502, CAPEC-586). The code takes input from a cookie and passes it to `unserialize()`.\n\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary file writes, including the potential for uploading a webshell. Depending on the gadget chains available in the application, remote code execution is also possible.\n\n*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP request. An attacker sets a malicious value for the \"remember me\" cookie.\n\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to set or modify the value of the \"remember me\" cookie. The attacker also needs to know the value of `PRODUCT_NAME` to construct the correct cookie name.\n\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** The suggested mitigation is to use the `allowed_classes` option with `unserialize()` to restrict the classes that can be deserialized or replace serialization with `json_encode` and `json_decode`.\n\n*   **More detail than CVE description:** Yes, the content provides more detail than a standard CVE description. It includes specific code examples, the vulnerable file and line numbers, steps to reproduce, and a proof of concept exploit.",

CWE-784 [Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision] is related because the vulnerability occurs due to the system relying on a cookie without proper validation, which provides the untrusted data for deserialization. CWE-784 is a variant-level CWE, making it more specific, but it is a secondary concern to the core issue of deserialization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    cwe784[\"CWE-784: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision\"]\n    \n    cwe784 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe502\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe502 primary\n    class cwe784 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **reliance on a cookie without proper validation** (CWE-784). This leads to the **deserialization of untrusted data** (CWE-502), which can then lead to remote code execution or arbitrary file writes. The **deserialization** is the direct root cause as it's the unsafe operation being performed on the untrusted data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a vulnerability due to insecure deserialization. The primary CWE, CWE-502 [Deserialization of Untrusted Data], accurately reflects the root cause as the system **deserializes untrusted data** without proper validation. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**deserialization**\" as the root cause. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that the vulnerability arises from the deserialization of untrusted data. The suggested mitigation also points to deserialization issues, such as using `allowed_classes` with `unserialize()` or replacing serialization with `json_encode` and `json_decode`.\n\nCWE-784 [Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision] is a secondary CWE because the application relies on the contents of a cookie (the data being deserialized) without properly validating it. This is the mechanism that provides the untrusted data. The vulnerability description indicates that the manipulation of the `cookieName` argument leads to deserialization.\n\nThe retriever results also support the selection of CWE-502 [Deserialization of Untrusted Data], which has a high relevance score.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-502 [Deserialization of Untrusted Data] is a base-level CWE that accurately describes the root cause. CWE-784 [Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision] is a variant-level CWE which accurately describes how the untrusted data is passed to the application.\n\nOther CWEs Considered and Rejected:\n\n*   CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] and CWE-89 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')] were considered due to their high retriever scores. However, they are not relevant as the vulnerability is related to deserialization, not input neutralization.\n*   CWE-434 [Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type] was considered, but it is not relevant because the vulnerability does not involve file uploads.\n*   CWE-1336 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine] was also considered, but it's not applicable since the vulnerability isn't related to template engines.",
