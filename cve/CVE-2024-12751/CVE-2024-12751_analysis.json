  "description": "Foxit PDF Reader AcroForm Out-Of-Bounds Read Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Foxit PDF Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of AcroForms. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-25344.",

CWE-125 is a base-level CWE, providing a specific description of the vulnerability, while CWE-20 is a class-level CWE that represents a more general category of input validation issues. CWE-125 is a child of CWE-119 \"Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\", which indicates a more general class of memory boundary errors.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe125\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with a **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-20), which leads to an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125). This, in turn, allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as a potential primary CWE based on similar CVE descriptions. However, the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"Out-of-Bounds Read\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms \"Out-of-bounds read\" as the weakness. Therefore, CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is the most accurate primary CWE. The root cause is a **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, so CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a secondary contributing factor. CWE-125 is at the optimal level of specificity as a Base CWE, directly describing the out-of-bounds read condition.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available.
