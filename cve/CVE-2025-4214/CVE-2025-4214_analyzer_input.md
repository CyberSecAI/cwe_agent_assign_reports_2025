## Analysis of CVE-2025-4214 Content

The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Phpgurukul Online DJ Booking Management System V1.0". This **relates** to a potential CVE, but it's important to note this is a report *about* a vulnerability, not the official CVE description itself. It provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description would.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the 'fromdate' parameter in the `/admin/booking-bwdates-reports-details.php` file.  Malicious code injected into this parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   Comprehensive system control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The `/admin/booking-bwdates-reports-details.php` file is vulnerable via the 'fromdate' POST parameter.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the vulnerable file with a crafted 'fromdate' parameter. No authentication is required.
*   Knowledge of SQL injection techniques is necessary.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.
*   **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.
*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the least necessary privileges.
*   **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.

**Payload Example:**

```
Parameter: fromdate (POST)
    Type: time-based blind
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
    Payload: fromdate=1' AND (SELECT 4016 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))uvcB) AND 'KUwg'='KUwg&tomdate=1
