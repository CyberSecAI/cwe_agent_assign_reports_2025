CWE-120 is a more specific case of CWE-119, focusing on buffer copies without size checking, which directly aligns with the vulnerability description indicating a **buffer overflow** due to the `GET` command. Although CWE-119 was a top retriever result, its discouraged usage and higher abstraction level made CWE-120 a better fit as a base CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe120 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the FTP server's handling of the `GET` command, which leads to a **buffer overflow** due to the lack of size checking when copying data into a buffer. This allows for arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the description of the **buffer overflow** in the `GET` command handler. The evidence, \"The manipulation leads to **buffer overflow**,\" directly supports the identification of a buffer-related weakness. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also confirms this by stating, \"A remote buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Freefloat FTP Server 1.0 when handling the 'GET' command.\"\n\nCWE-120 aligns well with the evidence because it describes a scenario where a buffer copy operation occurs without proper size validation, leading to an overflow. CWE-119 was considered but ultimately deemed less specific, as it is a broader class of memory buffer errors.\n\nCWE-120 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) because it accurately represents the root cause of the vulnerability which is a buffer copy operation that lacks input size validation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified
