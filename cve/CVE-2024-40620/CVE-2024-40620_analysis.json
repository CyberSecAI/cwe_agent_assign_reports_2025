CWE-311 is a Class-level CWE, while CWE-319 is a Base-level CWE and child of CWE-311. Since the vulnerability description indicates that data is being transmitted without encryption, both CWEs are relevant. However, CWE-311 is a more direct fit for the **lack of encryption**, while CWE-319 describes the specific impact of that **lack of encryption**: cleartext transmission.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe311 primary\n    class cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of encryption**, leading to the transmission of sensitive information in cleartext, and ultimately impacting data confidentiality.\n\nRoot Cause: **lack of encryption** (CWE-311)\nImpact: Cleartext transmission (CWE-319)\nImpact: Data confidentiality impact\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability and its impact. The vulnerability description explicitly states the **lack of encryption** of sensitive information. This directly aligns with CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data). The subsequent transmission of data without encryption matches CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information).\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the parent-child relationship between CWE-311 and CWE-319. While both are relevant, CWE-311 more accurately represents the root cause, while CWE-319 describes the resulting transmission in cleartext.\n\nCWE-311 is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **lack of encryption**. CWE-319 is a valid secondary CWE due to the resulting cleartext transmission. The chosen CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
