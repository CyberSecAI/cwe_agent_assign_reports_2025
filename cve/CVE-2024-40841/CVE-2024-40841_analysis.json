This hierarchical relationship indicates that CWE-787 is a specific type of CWE-119. Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions an **out-of-bounds write**, selecting the more specific CWE-787 is appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a maliciously crafted video file, leading to an **out-of-bounds write**, which then results in unexpected application termination.\n\nMalicious Video File --> **Out-of-bounds Write** (CWE-787) --> Application Termination\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which explicitly states an **out-of-bounds write** issue. The evidence is strong, and the confidence level is high.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the parent-child relationship between CWE-787 and CWE-119. While CWE-119 is a related and broader category, CWE-787 is a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability described.\n\nThe selected CWE, CWE-787, is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly corresponds to the **root cause** identified in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\nCWE-125 was considered but not selected because the vulnerability description explicitly states an **out-of-bounds write** issue, not a read.\n\n## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\nCWE-843 was considered but not selected because the vulnerability description explicitly states an **out-of-bounds write** issue, not type confusion.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\nCWE-131 was considered but not selected because there is no evidence to suggest that the buffer size was incorrectly calculated. The description focuses on an out-of-bounds write, which may or may not be caused by an incorrect buffer size calculation.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\nCWE-667 was considered but not selected because there is no evidence to suggest that improper locking is involved.\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\nCWE-665 was considered but not selected because there is no evidence to suggest that improper initialization is the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\nCWE-193 was considered but not selected because the description focuses on a more general **out-of-bounds write** rather than a specific off-by-one error.\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\nCWE-252 was considered but not selected because there is no evidence to suggest that an unchecked return value is related to the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\nCWE-119 was considered and listed as a secondary candidate.

However, CWE-787 is a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\nCWE-367 was considered but not selected because there is no evidence to suggest that a TOCTOU race condition is involved.\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\nCWE-824 was considered but not selected because there is no evidence to suggest that an uninitialized pointer is related to the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\nCWE-190 was considered but not selected because there is no evidence to suggest that an integer overflow or wraparound is related to the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error\nCWE-197 was considered but not selected because there is no evidence to suggest that a numeric truncation error is related to the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-128: Wrap-around Error\nCWE-128 was considered but not selected because there is no evidence to suggest that a wrap-around error is related to the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset\nCWE-823 was considered but not selected because there is no evidence to suggest that the use of an out-of-range pointer offset is related to the vulnerability. The description focuses on a general out-of-bounds write.\n\n## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')\nCWE-124 was considered but not selected because the vulnerability is described as an **out-of-bounds write**, not a buffer underwrite.\n\n## CWE-1339: Insufficient Precision or Accuracy of a Real Number\nCWE-1339 was considered but not selected because there is no evidence to suggest that insufficient precision or accuracy of a real number is related to the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\nCWE-825 was considered but not selected because there is no evidence to suggest that an expired pointer dereference is related to the vulnerability.",
