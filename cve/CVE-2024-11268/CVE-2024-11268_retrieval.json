A malicious actor can leverage this vulnerability to cause a crash or could lead to an arbitrary **memory leak**.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## WEAKNESS: 'Out-of-Bounds Read'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1.

This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to st...\n\n### 4. CWE-193: Off-by-one Error (Score: 277.09)\n\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value....\n\n### 5.
