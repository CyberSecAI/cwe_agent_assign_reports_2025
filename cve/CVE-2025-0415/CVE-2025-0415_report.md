# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-0415

## Description

A remote attacker with web administrator privileges can exploit the devices web interface to execute arbitrary system commands through the NTP settings. Successful exploitation may result in the device entering an infinite reboot loop, leading to a total or partial denial of connectivity for downstream systems that rely on its network services.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Impact:** execute arbitrary system commands, total or partial denial of connectivity
- **Attacker:** remote attacker with web administrator privileges
- **Component:** NTP settings

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-285 | Improper Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-78, which is a base-level weakness describing **improper neutralization of special elements** used in an OS command. This CWE is a child of CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command) and CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')). CWE-78 can lead to CWE-184 (Improper Enforcement of Boundary Conditions).

The secondary CWE is CWE-285, which is a class-level weakness describing **improper authorization**. This CWE is high-level and is often misused when lower-level CWEs can be used instead. It is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with an **improper neutralization of special elements** used in an OS command (CWE-78). A remote attacker with web administrator privileges exploits the deviceâ€™s web interface to execute arbitrary system commands through the NTP settings. This can then result in an infinite reboot loop, leading to a total or partial denial of connectivity (impact). The attacker needs to have web administrator privileges to exploit this vulnerability, which means the system does not properly perform an authorization check (CWE-285).

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-78, which is supported by the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" specifying "CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')" and the vulnerability description stating the attacker can "execute arbitrary system commands through the NTP settings".

CWE-285 is considered because the attacker needs web administrator privileges. While the vulnerability description indicates that the attacker needs "web administrator privileges," which suggests an authorization issue, the primary root cause lies in the **improper neutralization of special elements** that allows command injection. The access control aspect (CWE-285) is a prerequisite for exploiting the **command injection** (CWE-78), but the command injection is the more direct cause of the vulnerability. It is a plausible secondary weakness to consider.

The evidence clearly points to **command injection** as the core issue, making CWE-78 the most appropriate primary classification.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This is not the correct CWE because the attacker has privileges to access the NTP settings.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This is not the correct CWE because the vulnerability is not related to path equivalence.

## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This is not the correct CWE because the attacker has web administrator privileges.

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected*: This is not the correct CWE because the vulnerability is not related to data authenticity.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This is not the correct CWE because the vulnerability is related to **command injection** not a security decision.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

*Not Selected*: CWE-78 is more specific to OS Command Injection.

## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This is not the correct CWE because the vulnerability is related to **command injection** not privilege definition.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-
