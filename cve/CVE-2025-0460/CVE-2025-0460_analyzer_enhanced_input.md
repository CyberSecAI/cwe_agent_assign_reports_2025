## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-0460 Content

This content **RELATES** to CVE-2025-0460. It provides significantly more detail than the placeholder CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The BlogBotz OpenCart module allows unrestricted file uploads. The `image` parameter in a POST request to `/index.php?route=extension/module/blog_add` accepts a URL to a file, which is then downloaded and saved to the server without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-434:** Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
*   **CWE-918:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
*   **CAPEC-650:** Upload a Web Shell to a Web Server

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthenticated attacker can gain unauthorized access to the site/hosting infrastructure.
*   Potential for executing arbitrary code via a PHP webshell.
*   Full site compromise, including access to admin session details/credentials and manipulation of application/code.
*   Exfiltration of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and/or payment details.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Sending a POST request to `/index.php?route=extension/module/blog_add` with a malicious URL in the `image` parameter.
*   The attacker-controlled server hosting the malicious file must serve the raw PHP source if a PHP file is uploaded.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Unauthenticated - no authentication is required.
*   Ability to host a malicious file (e.g., using a simple HTTP server).
*   Basic understanding of HTTP requests and PHP.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Require authentication before processing file uploads.
*   Implement file type validation (allow-list) to ensure only valid image files are accepted.
*   Configure the webserver to prevent execution of PHP scripts in user-uploadable directories.
