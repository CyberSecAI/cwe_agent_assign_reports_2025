  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in Blog Botz for Journal Theme 1.0 on OpenCart. This affects an unknown part of the file /index.php?route=extension/module/blog_add. The manipulation of the argument image leads to **unrestricted upload**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-0460 Content\n\nThis content **RELATES** to CVE-2025-0460. It provides significantly more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe BlogBotz OpenCart module allows unrestricted file uploads. The `image` parameter in a POST request to `/index.php?route=extension/module/blog_add` accepts a URL to a file, which is then downloaded and saved to the server without proper validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **CWE-434:** Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n*   **CWE-918:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n*   **CAPEC-650:** Upload a Web Shell to a Web Server\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthenticated attacker can gain unauthorized access to the site/hosting infrastructure.\n*   Potential for executing arbitrary code via a PHP webshell.\n*   Full site compromise, including access to admin session details/credentials and manipulation of application/code.\n*   Exfiltration of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and/or payment details.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Sending a POST request to `/index.php?route=extension/module/blog_add` with a malicious URL in the `image` parameter.\n*   The attacker-controlled server hosting the malicious file must serve the raw PHP source if a PHP file is uploaded.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Unauthenticated - no authentication is required.\n*   Ability to host a malicious file (e.g., using a simple HTTP server).\n*   Basic understanding of HTTP requests and PHP.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Require authentication before processing file uploads.\n*   Implement file type validation (allow-list) to ensure only valid image files are accepted.\n*   Configure the webserver to prevent execution of PHP scripts in user-uploadable directories.",

The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**unrestricted upload**\". The CVE reference confirms that the `image` parameter allows uploading files without proper validation. |\n| CWE-918 | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The CVE reference mentions that the application downloads a file from a URL provided by the user. This suggests the possibility of an SSRF attack, where an attacker could potentially force the server to make requests to internal resources.|\n| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The CVE reference explicitly states, \"Unauthenticated - no authentication is required,\" before processing file uploads. This means that anyone can upload files, which is a critical flaw. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\n- CWE-434 is the primary weakness, allowing the upload of dangerous file types.\n- CWE-918 can occur because the application fetches data from an external URL without proper validation.\n- CWE-306 exacerbates both CWE-434 and CWE-918 because the lack of authentication allows any attacker to exploit these weaknesses.\n- CWE-434, CWE-918, and CWE-306 are all Base level CWEs, offering the most specific descriptions for this vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe434 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe918\n    cwe306 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe434\n    cwe306 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe918\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe434 primary\n    class cwe918,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n1.  **CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function:** This is the starting point. The application lacks authentication for the file upload functionality.\n2.  **CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type:** Because there's no authentication, an attacker can upload any file type.\n3.  **CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application fetches files from URLs provided by the user, which can be abused to make internal requests.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is primarily an **unrestricted upload** issue (CWE-434), which is directly stated in the vulnerability description. The CVE reference confirms this by explaining how the `image` parameter is vulnerable. Since no authentication is required before processing file uploads (CWE-306), anyone can exploit this vulnerability. The server fetches the file from an external URL (CWE-918), compounding the issue.\n\nThe Retriever Results also suggest CWE-434 as a strong candidate. The graph-based results list CWE-434 and other related weaknesses like CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) and CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory).\n\nI considered other CWEs from the Retriever Results but did not include them because they were not as directly relevant:\n- CWE-89 (SQL Injection): There's no direct evidence of SQL injection in the description.\n- CWE-79 (Cross-Site Scripting): There's no direct evidence of XSS in the description.\n- CWE-22 (Path Traversal): While possible, the primary issue is the unrestricted upload itself, not necessarily a path traversal vulnerability.\n- CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path): This is related to CWE-434 but less specific to the core problem.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity (Base). They directly address the root cause and contributing factors of the vulnerability based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and CVE reference.",
