  "description": "The Profitori plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to a **missing capability check** on the stocktend_object endpoint in versions 2.0.6.0 to 2.1.1.3. This makes it possible to trigger the save_object_as_user() function for objects whose _datatype is set to users,. This allows unauthenticated attackers to write arbitrary strings straight into the users wp_capabilities meta field, potentially elevating the privileges of an existing user account or a newly created one to that of an administrator.",

This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-862, where the product fails to perform an authorization check before allowing access to a resource or action. The impact of this **missing check** is that unauthenticated attackers can escalate privileges, which makes it possible to write arbitrary strings straight into the users wp_capabilities meta field.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description, specifically the phrase \"**missing capability check**\". The retriever results also list CWE-862 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) and CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) were considered as secondary CWEs because the ultimate impact of the vulnerability is privilege escalation, but the root cause is the **missing authorization check**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-862 directly addresses the **missing authorization** issue, while CWE-266 captures the consequence of privilege escalation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
