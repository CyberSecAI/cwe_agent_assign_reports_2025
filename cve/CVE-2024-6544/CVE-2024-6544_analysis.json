  "description": "The Custom Post Limits plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to full path disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.1. This is due to the plugin utilizing bootstrap and leaving test files with display_errors on. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6544:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability is caused by the Custom Post Limits plugin leaving test files with `display_errors` enabled. This setting exposes the full server path of the application when errors occur during script execution.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Full Path Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of the web application's full server path. This occurs due to the `display_errors` setting being enabled in the test files, specifically `bootstrap.php`.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** The exposed server path can be used by attackers to gain knowledge of the system's file structure. This information is not directly exploitable but could be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to perform more severe attacks.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Unauthenticated HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploitable via unauthenticated requests to the affected test file (`bootstrap.php`). This means no prior user authentication is needed.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Remote Access:** Attackers can be remote and do not need any special privileges on the server.\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the WordPress site.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability is present in Custom Post Limits plugin versions up to and including 4.4.1.\n-  The specific file exposing the vulnerability is `tests/bootstrap.php` within the plugin directory.\n- The Wordfence article states that the information is not useful on its own and requires another vulnerability for a successful attack.",

This is the root cause of the vulnerability, where sensitive information (full path) is being inserted into the sent data (error message). |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of CWE-201's description to the vulnerability details. The vulnerability involves the insertion of sensitive information (full path) into data sent in error messages, aligning perfectly with CWE-201.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe201 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of the following:\n1.  **Root Cause:** `display_errors` is enabled in test files.\n2.  The application generates an error.\n3.  The full path is inserted into the error message.\n4.  **Impact:** Full path disclosure.\n\nThe primary weakness is CWE-201, which directly represents the insertion of sensitive information into the sent data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which includes a detailed description of the vulnerability and its root cause. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the plugin utilizes bootstrap and leaves test files with `display_errors` on, leading to full path disclosure. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that the vulnerability is caused by leaving test files with `display_errors` enabled, which exposes the full server path. The most relevant CWE based on this information is CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data), as it directly addresses the core issue of sensitive information being inserted into sent data. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-201 is the most appropriate choice. Other CWEs were considered but were not as directly relevant to the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n*Not Selected:* CSRF is not relevant because the vulnerability is about information disclosure, not about unauthorized actions.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* Forced browsing is not relevant because it's not about authorization bypass, but more specifically about sensitive data included in output.\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its

vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* Unrelated to file uploads.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is not about externally controlled immutable parameters.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* Authorization Bypass is not the primary issue, but sensitive data exposure.\n\n## CWE-178: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly account for differences in case sensitivity when accessing or determining the properties of a resource, leading to inconsistent results.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* Case sensitivity is irrelevant here.\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is not path traversal.\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Selected:* This is the core issue, as the full path is sensitive data being inserted into the output.\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* While authorization might be indirectly related, the primary issue is the exposure of sensitive data, not the lack of authorization.\n\n## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not
