## Vulnerability Description
The teachPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the order parameter of the tpsearch shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 9.0.7 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**.
