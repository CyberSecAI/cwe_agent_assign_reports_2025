While the description indicates an access control issue, the lack of specific details regarding the root cause (authentication or authorization) led to the selection of the more general CWE-284. The guidance suggests using more specific children like CWE-285, CWE-862, or CWE-863 if the root cause were clearer, but the current evidence does not support that.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe284 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **Improper Access Control** issue. This leads to a Security feature bypass. The specific steps and technical details on how the access control is bypassed are not available.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **Improper Access Control** as the primary weakness based on the vulnerability description. The description mentions that a low-privileged attacker can bypass security measures, indicating an access control issue. However, the description lacks specific details about whether the issue stems from missing authentication, incorrect authorization, or other access control flaws.\n\nThe selection of CWE-284 is based on the guidance provided, which suggests using CWE-284 when the root cause of the access control failure is unclear. Without more information, choosing a more specific CWE like CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) or CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) would be speculative.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE Classification Guidance\n\nThe following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:\n\n### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance\n\n## ===Guidance===\n\n### Level Set \u2013 Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control\n\n**Authentication**:\nDetermines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.\n\n* Example phrases: \"user must log in\", \"lack of login check\", \"bypasses login\"\n* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.\n\n  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* \u2013 used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).\n\n**Authorization**:\nDetermines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do.

  "analysis_with_relationships": "# Summary\n| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.75 | Pillar | Allowed | General access control issue where the root cause is unclear. |\n  \n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the CWE selection was the hierarchical relationship between CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) and its potential children. While the description indicates an access control issue, the lack of specific details regarding the root cause (authentication or authorization) led to the selection of the more general CWE-284. The guidance suggests using more specific children like CWE-285, CWE-862, or CWE-863 if the root cause were clearer, but the current evidence does not support that.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe284 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **Improper Access Control** issue. This leads to a Security feature bypass. The specific steps and technical details on how the access control is bypassed are not available.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **Improper Access Control** as the primary weakness based on the vulnerability description. The description mentions that a low-privileged attacker can bypass security measures, indicating an access control issue. However, the description lacks specific details about whether the issue stems from missing authentication, incorrect authorization, or other access control flaws.\n\nThe selection of CWE-284 is based on the guidance provided, which suggests using CWE-284 when the root cause of the access control failure is unclear. Without more information, choosing a more specific CWE like CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) or CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) would be speculative.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE Classification Guidance\n\nThe following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:\n\n### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance\n\n## ===Guidance===\n\n### Level Set \u2013 Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control\n\n**Authentication**:\nDetermines *who* the actor is (identity validation).
