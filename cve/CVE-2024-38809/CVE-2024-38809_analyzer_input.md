# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-38809

## Vulnerability Description
Applications that parse ETags from If-Match or If-None-Match request headers are vulnerable to DoS attack. Users of affected versions should upgrade to the corresponding fixed version. Users of older, unsupported versions could enforce a size limit on If-Match and If-None-Match headers, e.g. through a Filter.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** DoS attack

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-38809:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Spring Framework parses ETags from "If-Match" or "If-None-Match" request headers.  Specifically, the parsing process is susceptible to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure parsing of ETag values within HTTP headers.
- Vulnerability to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition, making the affected application unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests.
- Specifically, requests with a large amount of data in "If-Match" or "If-None-Match" headers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the targeted application.
- The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this vulnerability, making it remotely exploitable.
- The attacker does not need any prior privileges

**Additional Notes:**
- The NetApp advisory lists multiple products that are affected and also products not affected and under investigation.
- The Spring advisory notes that older, unsupported versions are also affected, and that there are no other mitigations besides upgrading to the corrected versions (or implementing custom filters).
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.9 (MEDIUM), with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.
