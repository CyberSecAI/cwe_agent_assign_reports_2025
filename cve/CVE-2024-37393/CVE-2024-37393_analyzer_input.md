# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-37393

## Vulnerability Description
Multiple **LDAP injection**s vulnerabilities exist in SecurEnvoy MFA before 9.4.514 due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An unauthenticated remote attacker could exfiltrate data from Active Directory through blind **LDAP injection** attacks against the DESKTOP service exposed on the /secserver HTTP endpoint. This may include ms-Mcs-AdmPwd, which has a cleartext password for the Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) feature.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper input validation**
- **weakness:** **LDAP injection**
- **impact:** data exfiltration from Active Directory and exfiltrate data
- **attacker:** unauthenticated remote attacker
- **product:** SecurEnvoy MFA
- **version:** before 9.4.514
- **component:** /secserver HTTP endpoint

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-37393:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation of user-supplied data within the SecurEnvoy MFA's "*DESKTOP*" protocol, specifically within the `securectrl.exe` binary. This allows for LDAP injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **User Enumeration (VULN 1):** The application exposes an unauthenticated endpoint `/secserver` that allows for user enumeration via the `USERID` parameter in the "*DESKTOP*" protocol. The server responds differently based on whether a user exists or not, enabling enumeration.
*   **LDAP Injection (USERID) (VULN 2):**  The `USERID` parameter within the "*DESKTOP*" protocol is directly inserted into LDAP queries without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary LDAP filters to extract information.
*   **LDAP Injection (MEMBEROF) (VULN 3):** Similar to the `USERID` vulnerability, the `MEMBEROF` parameter is also directly inserted into LDAP queries without sanitization, enabling LDAP injection via the "*DESKTOP*" protocol.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can exfiltrate sensitive data from Active Directory, including:
    *   SecurEnvoy's secret attributes (encrypted 2FA factors), stored in the `telexNumber` and `primaryTelexNumber` attributes.
    *   Potentially any Active Directory attribute that the service account has permissions to access, such as `ms-MCS-AdmPwd` (LAPS passwords).
*   **User Enumeration:** Attackers can enumerate valid user accounts that are tied to the SecurEnvoy MFA, which can be used in further attacks.
*   **Privileged Access:** The LDAP queries are executed using the SecurEnvoy service account, which often has elevated privileges (e.g., Domain Administrator), amplifying the impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Exploitation:** The `/secserver` endpoint, which handles the "*DESKTOP*" protocol, is exposed without authentication, allowing remote attackers to exploit the vulnerabilities directly over the network.
*   **Custom "*DESKTOP*" Protocol Messages:** Attackers send crafted HTTP POST requests to `/secserver` with specifically formatted "*DESKTOP*" protocol messages containing malicious LDAP injection payloads within the `USERID` or `MEMBEROF` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers require network access to the vulnerable SecurEnvoy MFA instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication is needed to access the vulnerable endpoint and exploit the LDAP injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Technical Skills:** An understanding of HTTP requests, the "*DESKTOP*" protocol, and LDAP injection techniques is required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerable software is SecurEnvoy MFA version 9.4.513 and earlier.
*   The fix is available in version 9.4.514 and later.
*   The blog post from optistream.io provides significant details beyond the basic CVE description.
*   A python script was made available by Optistream as a Proof of Concept:  [https://github.com/optistream/securenvoy-cve-2024-37393](https://github.com/optistream/securenvoy-cve-2024-37393)
