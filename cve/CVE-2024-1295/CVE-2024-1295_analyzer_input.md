# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-1295

## Vulnerability Description
The events-calendar-pro WordPress plugin before 6.4.0.1, The Events Calendar WordPress plugin before 6.4.0.1 does not prevent users with at least the contributor role from leaking details about events they shouldnt have access to. (e.g. password-protected events, drafts, etc.)

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper access control**
- **impact:** access password-protected events and drafts
- **attacker:** users with contributor role
- **product:** The Events Calendar WordPress plugin
- **version:** before 6.4.0.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1295:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control in The Events Calendar and Events Calendar Pro plugins. Specifically, the plugins fail to prevent users with the "contributor" role (or higher) from accessing event details that they should not have permission to view. This includes password-protected events, drafts, and other restricted event statuses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is the failure to enforce access restrictions based on user roles and event statuses. Contributors can use shortcodes to bypass these restrictions.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized disclosure of sensitive event data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** Users with contributor roles can view event details that should be restricted, such as the content of private or password-protected events.
- **Information Leakage:** Confidential information present within those events becomes accessible to unauthorized users.
- **Potential Security Risk:** The access to sensitive event details could lead to other malicious activities if the content contains sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers (users with contributor or higher roles) can embed specific shortcodes into posts or pages to retrieve details of events they do not have direct access to.
- **Event ID Manipulation:** By guessing or knowing the event ID, a contributor can use this ID in the shortcode to view the details of the targeted event.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **WordPress Contributor Role:** The attacker needs to have at least the contributor role within the WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of Event IDs:** The attacker needs to either know or guess the ID of the event they want to access.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects both the free "The Events Calendar" plugin and the premium "Events Calendar Pro" plugin.
- The vulnerability is fixed in versions 6.4.0.1 and later for both plugins.
- The provided content also offers a proof of concept for both the free and pro plugin scenarios.
- The CVSS score is 2.7 (Low), based on a high required privilege (Contributor role) and low confidentiality impact.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

## Summary – Quick LLM Rules of Thumb

| **Indicator**                                              | **Likely CWE** |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| No identity check (no login)                               | CWE-306        |
| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
