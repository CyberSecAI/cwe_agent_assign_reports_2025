## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control**, leading to the exposure of sensitive information. Users with the contributor role can bypass intended restrictions and access details about events they shouldn't have access to, such as password-protected events and drafts. This results in information leakage.

## Summary of Analysis
Based on the vulnerability description and the provided information, the primary weakness is **incorrect authorization**. The vulnerability allows users with the contributor role to access event details that they should not have access to, such as password-protected events and drafts. This aligns with the definition of CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), where the product performs an authorization check, but does not correctly perform the check. The **impact** is that it leads to CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor).
The selection of CWE-863 is based on the **rootcause** evidence from "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" and "CVE Reference Links Content Summary", specifically "**improper access control**" and "failure to enforce access restrictions". The "Retriever Results" also lists CWE-863 as the top candidate.
