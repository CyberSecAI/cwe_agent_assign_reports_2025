  "description": "A vulnerability was found in kurniaramadhan E-Commerce-PHP 1.0. It has been declared as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file /blog-details.php. The manipulation of the argument blog_id leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

The SQL Injection vulnerability allows for the retrieval of admin credentials. XSS is then achieved by exploiting this to inject malicious JavaScript code. Also there is a CSRF Vulnerability\n*   **Impact of exploitation**: Mass user data at risk, database leaks can happen, admin panel credentials in risk, and the ability to store malicious JavaScript code from the admin panel.\n*   **Attack vectors**: Exploiting SQL Injection vulnerabilities in the application to retrieve admin credentials and then using those credentials to log in to the admin panel and inject XSS payloads\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to find and exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities, decrypt a password, and understand how to inject XSS payloads in the admin panel of the vulnerable application.\n*   **Mitigation or fix**: The article does not describe any mitigation or fix.\n\nThe content provides more detail than the official CVE description because it describes the vulnerable application, the technical details of the vulnerability, how to exploit, and the impact of the exploitation.\n```",

The vulnerability description clearly states that the manipulation of the `blog_id` argument leads to **SQL injection**. |\n| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicates an XSS vulnerability in addition to the SQL Injection. |\n| CWE-352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | 0.6 | Compound | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicates a CSRF vulnerability in addition to the SQL Injection and XSS. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-89, **SQL Injection**, which can lead to other vulnerabilities. The retriever results and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicate the presence of **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** which is CWE-79 and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) which is CWE-352. CWE-79 and CWE-352 are both PeerOf CWE-89. The primary CWE is at the Base level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -- PEEROF --> cwe89\n    cwe352 -- PEEROF --> cwe89\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe79,cwe352 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **SQL Injection** (**CWE-89**). According to the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, the **SQL Injection** vulnerability allows for the retrieval of admin credentials. This then allows for **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** (**CWE-79**) by injecting malicious JavaScript code via the admin panel. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also mentions a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability, so **CWE-352** is included in the chain.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly points to **SQL Injection** due to the manipulation of the `blog_id` argument, making **CWE-89** the primary weakness. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this and further identifies **XSS** and CSRF vulnerabilities. This additional information strengthens the selection of **CWE-79** and **CWE-352** as secondary weaknesses. The relationship analysis shows that these vulnerabilities are related, with **SQL Injection** potentially leading to the exploitation of the others. The chosen CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, providing sufficient specificity for the described vulnerabilities.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path): While file paths might be involved, the core issue is the **SQL Injection** and not direct manipulation of file paths.\n*   CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type): This CWE is not directly related to the described vulnerability, which focuses on **SQL Injection** and resulting **XSS**.\n*   CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')): This is too general. The **SQL Injection** is the root cause, not arbitrary code injection.\n*   CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function): While authentication might be bypassed due to the **SQL Injection**, the primary issue is the improper handling of SQL queries.\n*   CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine): This is not applicable as there is no mention of a template engine in the vulnerability description.",
