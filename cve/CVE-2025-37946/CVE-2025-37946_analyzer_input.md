## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved s390/pci Fix duplicate pci_dev_put() in disable_slot() when PF has child VFs With commit bcb5d6c76903 (s390/pci introduce lock to synchronize state of zpci_devs) the code to ignore power off of a PF that has child VFs was changed from a direct return to a goto to the unlock and pci_dev_put() section.
