  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved s390/pci Fix duplicate pci_dev_put() in disable_slot() when PF has child VFs With commit bcb5d6c76903 (s390/pci introduce lock to synchronize state of zpci_devs) the code to ignore power off of a PF that has child VFs was changed from a direct return to a goto to the unlock and pci_dev_put() section. The change however left the existing pci_dev_put() untouched resulting in a doubple put. This can subsequently cause a **use after free** if the struct pci_dev is released in an unexpected state. Fix this by removing the extra pci_dev_put().",

While the description points to a **use after free** condition, the root cause stems from a double `pci_dev_put()`, which could potentially lead to a double free. The choice of **CWE-416 (Use After Free)** as the primary CWE is based on the explicit mention of \"use after free\" in the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe415[\"CWE-415: Double Free\"]\n    cwe123[\"CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\"]\n    cwe666[\"CWE-666: Operation on Resource in Wrong Phase of Lifetime\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on a Resource after Expiration or Release\"]\n\n    cwe415 -- CHILDOF --> cwe666\n    cwe415 -- CHILDOF --> cwe672\n    cwe415 -- PEEROF --> cwe416\n    cwe415 -- PEEROF --> cwe123\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe415 secondary\n    class cwe123 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a coding error: an extra `pci_dev_put()` call. This leads to a double free if the `struct pci_dev` is released in an unexpected state. This double free can then lead to a **use after free** condition if the freed memory is subsequently accessed.\n\n`Improper Resource Management` -> `Double Free` -> `Use After Free`\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is a **use after free**, as explicitly stated in the vulnerability description. The root cause is the duplicate `pci_dev_put()` call. The analysis heavily relies on the provided evidence, particularly the vulnerability description key phrases. The graph relationships helped to consider alternative classifications and understand the potential impact of the double free. The selection of **CWE-416 (Use After Free)** as the primary CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly describes the observed vulnerability. **CWE-415 (Double Free)** is a strong secondary candidate, representing a potential root cause or a closely related weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* While locking issues are often related to concurrency problems, there is no evidence in the vulnerability description to suggest that locking is directly involved in this vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* The description doesn't mention any explicit race condition.\n\n## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* There is no mention of an unchecked return value being the cause.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
