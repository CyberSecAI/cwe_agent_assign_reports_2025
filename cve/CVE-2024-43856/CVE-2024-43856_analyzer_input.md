# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-43856

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved dma fix call order in dmam_free_coherent dmam_free_coherent() frees a DMA allocation, which makes the freed vaddr available for reuse, then calls devres_destroy() to remove and free the data structure used to track the DMA allocation. Between the two calls, it is possible for a concurrent task to make an allocation with the same vaddr and add it to the devres list. If this happens, there will be two entries in the devres list with the same vaddr and devres_destroy() can free the wrong entry, triggering the WARN_ON() in dmam_match. Fix by destroying the devres entry before freeing the DMA allocation. kokonut //net/encryption http//sponge2/b9145fe6-0f72-4325-ac2f-a84d81075b03

- **impact:** free the wrong entry
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** dmam_free_coherent

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect call order within the `dmam_free_coherent()` function in the Linux kernel's DMA (Direct Memory Access) subsystem. Specifically, the function first frees a DMA allocation, making the freed virtual address (`vaddr`) available for reuse, and then attempts to remove the associated device resource tracking data using `devres_destroy()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Race Condition:** A race condition exists between the freeing of the DMA allocation and the removal of its tracking data. A concurrent task could potentially allocate new DMA memory using the same virtual address that was just freed.
*   **Double Free (Potential):** If a concurrent allocation occurs and its data is added to the device resources list before `devres_destroy()` is called, `devres_destroy()` might inadvertently attempt to free the wrong entry in the devres list. This could cause the `dmam_match` to trigger a `WARN_ON()` due to the presence of two entries with the same `vaddr`, and can lead to memory corruption.
*   **Incorrect Resource Management:** The vulnerability highlights an issue in device resource management where the allocated resource (DMA memory) was freed before its resource tracking metadata was properly removed, leading to a potential inconsistency.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Kernel Panic/Crash:** The `WARN_ON()` in `dmam_match`, triggered by attempting to free the wrong resource, can lead to a kernel panic/crash, disrupting system operation.
*   **Memory Corruption:** Incorrect management of devres list can result in a double-free, leading to memory corruption, and subsequently potential privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Concurrency:** Exploiting the race condition requires a concurrent task to allocate DMA memory at the same virtual address very quickly after it has been released.
*   **DMA Subsystem:** The attack vector is within the DMA subsystem, requiring the attacker to trigger DMA allocation and deallocation operations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to trigger DMA operations:** An attacker would need the ability to trigger the allocation and deallocation of DMA coherent memory, likely through specific drivers or kernel interfaces.
*   **Concurrency control:** The attacker would need some control or knowledge of concurrent task execution to reliably trigger the race condition. This might involve timing, or manipulating process priorities.

**Fix:**

The fix for this vulnerability involves changing the order of operations in `dmam_free_coherent()`. The `devres_destroy()` call, which removes the tracking data, is now executed *before* the call to `dma_free_coherent()`, which actually frees the memory. This ensures that the devres entry is removed before the virtual address it's associated with can be reused.
