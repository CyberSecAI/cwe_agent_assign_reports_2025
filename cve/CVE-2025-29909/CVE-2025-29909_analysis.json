  "description": "CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. In versions 1.3.3 and prior, a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in CryptoLibs `Crypto_TC_ApplySecurity()` allows an attacker to craft a malicious TC frame that causes out-of-bounds memory writes. This can result in denial of service (DoS) or, under certain conditions, remote code execution (RCE). Any application or system that relies on CryptoLib for Telecommand (TC) processing and does not strictly validate incoming TC frames is at risk. This includes satellite ground stations or mission control software where attackers can inject malformed frames. A patch is available at commit c7e8a8745ff4b5e9bd7e500e91358e86d5abedcc.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-29909 based on provided content\n\n**1. Verification:**\n\nThe provided content details a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in the `Crypto_TC_ApplySecurity()` function of the CryptoLib library. This directly relates to the CVE-2025-29909 as identified in the advisory.\n\n**2. Extracted Information:**\n\n* **Root cause of vulnerability:**\n    The vulnerability stems from a lack of validation of the `fl` (frame length) field in the TC frame. This allows an attacker to provide a value that results in an incorrect calculation of `tf_payload_len`, leading to a buffer overflow during the `memcpy` operation.\n\n* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    * Heap buffer overflow (CWE-191, CWE-787)\n    * Insufficient input validation\n\n* **Impact of exploitation:**\n    * Denial of Service (DoS) due to heap corruption and process crash.\n    * Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) if heap protection mechanisms are insufficient.\n\n* **Attack vectors:**\n    * Network: An attacker can send a crafted TC frame over the network.\n\n* **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n    * The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious TC frame to the system processing the frames. This could be through a ground station, testing environment, or network-exposed service. No privileges are required.\n\n* **Mitigation or fix:**\n    * Implement strict bounds-checking on the `fl` (frame length) field.\n    * Ensure `tf_payload_len` is never negative or exceeds the actual size of the input buffer before performing `memcpy`.\n\n**3. Additional Details (compared to a placeholder CVE description):**\n\nThe provided content offers significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It includes:\n\n*   Specific function names (`Crypto_TC_ApplySecurity_Cam`, `Crypto_TC_ApplySecurity`) and file (`crypto_tc.c`).\n*   Code snippets illustrating the vulnerable code.\n*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) with a sample malicious frame and reproduction steps.\n*   CVSS score and metrics.\n*   Credits to the researchers who discovered and coordinated the disclosure.\n*   Detailed explanation of the vulnerability's impact and affected systems.\n*   Specific ASan logs to help reproduce the issue.",

CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer). The relationships show a progression from the initial flaws (integer overflow and missing input validation) to the out-of-bounds write, which is the direct cause of the vulnerability. The abstraction levels guided the selection towards more specific Base and Variant CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with:\n1.  **Integer Overflow (CWE-190)**: The `fl` field is not properly validated, leading to an integer overflow when calculating `tf_payload_len`.\n2.  **Improper Input Validation (CWE-1284)**: The input `fl` is not validated for maximum/minimum acceptable sizes.\n3.  **Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)**: The integer overflow leads to `memcpy` writing beyond buffer bounds.\n\nThe root causes are CWE-190 and CWE-1284 which leads to CWE-787.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified a **heap buffer overflow** vulnerability leading to out-of-bounds writes. The evidence from the CVE reference link content summary highlights the **lack of validation** of the `fl` field, resulting in an incorrect calculation of `tf_payload_len`, which then leads to the buffer overflow during the `memcpy` operation.\n\nThe graph relationships reinforce this understanding by showing how CWE-190 and CWE-1284 can precede CWE-787.\n\nCWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is the primary CWE because it directly describes the observed vulnerability. The integer overflow (CWE-190) and the missing input validation (CWE-1284) are contributing factors. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, representing the root cause and the resulting weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary.
