## Vulnerability Description
Tungsten Automation Power PDF PDF File Parsing Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Tungsten Automation Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PDF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a **memory corruption** condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24455.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of PDF files, which leads to a memory corruption condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could lead to a complete system compromise with the potential to access sensitive information and disrupt system availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a user opening a malicious PDF file or visiting a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF file or host a malicious page. The user must then interact with the malicious file or webpage (i.e., open the file or visit the page) for the exploit to succeed.
