  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mac802154 Fix potential RCU dereference issue in mac802154_scan_worker In the `mac802154_scan_worker` function, the `scan_req->type` field was accessed after the RCU read-side critical section was unlocked. According to RCU usage rules, this is illegal and can lead to unpredictable behavior, such as accessing memory that has been updated or causing use-after-free issues. This possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developed by myself, specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues. To address this, the `scan_req->type` value is now stored in a local variable `scan_req_type` while still within the RCU read-side critical section. The `scan_req_type` is then used after the RCU lock is released, ensuring that the type value is safely accessed without violating RCU rules.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The vulnerability lies in the `mac802154_scan_worker` function in the Linux kernel's mac802154 subsystem.\n- The `scan_req->type` field, which indicates the type of scan being performed, was accessed *after* the RCU (Read-Copy-Update) read-side critical section was exited. This violates RCU usage rules.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **RCU Dereference Issue:** Accessing `scan_req->type` outside of the RCU read-side critical section is a dereference violation. RCU protects shared data by allowing readers to access it without locks, but only within a critical section. After the critical section is exited, the data might be freed or modified, leading to issues.\n- **Potential Use-After-Free or Data Corruption:** The illegal access could lead to unpredictable behavior, including:\n    - **Use-after-free:** If the `scan_req` structure is freed after the RCU read-side critical section, accessing `scan_req->type` would result in a use-after-free.\n    - **Data corruption:** If the memory where `scan_req` resides is reallocated and overwritten after the RCU read-side critical section, the read would access unrelated data or potentially cause a crash.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:\n  - **Kernel Crash:** The system could crash due to the memory access violation.\n  - **Unpredictable Behavior:** The system might exhibit erratic or unexpected behavior.\n  - **Potential Denial of Service:** A crash could lead to a denial-of-service condition.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The vulnerability is triggered within the `mac802154_scan_worker` function, which is called when a scan request is processed.\n- An attacker would need to trigger a scan operation in the mac802154 subsystem.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker would need to be able to interact with the mac802154 networking subsystem.\n- This might involve:\n    - Having the appropriate network interface and drivers enabled\n    - Sending commands/requests to initiate scans.\n- The attacker would likely require a user with sufficient privileges to interact with the networking subsystem.\n\n**Fix:**\n- The fix involves storing the value of `scan_req->type` in a local variable, `scan_req_type`, *within* the RCU read-side critical section. The local variable is then used later *outside* the RCU read-side critical section to safely access the data. This ensures the value is accessed before the `scan_req` structure can be modified or freed.",

A secondary CWE, CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference, is also considered since accessing the resource after the RCU lock is released could lead to dereferencing a NULL pointer if the `scan_req` structure has been freed. These two CWEs are related in that CWE-367 can precede CWE-476. The abstraction level for both is Base, which is preferred.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    \n    cwe367 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe476\n    cwe367 -->|PEEROF| cwe667\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe367 primary\n    class cwe476 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper RCU usage** leading to a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition (CWE-367), which can then result in a NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476) or data corruption. The root cause is accessing `scan_req->type` after the RCU lock is released, creating a window where the data can change.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. The key point is the **improper RCU usage** in the `mac802154_scan_worker` function, where `scan_req->type` is accessed after the RCU read-side critical section is unlocked. This creates a race condition where the value of `scan_req->type` can change between the time the RCU lock is released and the time the value is accessed.\n\nThe evidence from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" strongly supports this:\n\n*   \"**rootcause:** **improper RCU usage**\"\n*   \"accessing scan_req->type after RCU unlock\"\n*   \"RCU Dereference Issue: Accessing `scan_req->type` outside of the RCU read-side critical section is a dereference violation.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-367 is optimal because it directly addresses the Time-of-check Time-of-use issue introduced by the **improper RCU usage**. CWE-476 is considered a potential consequence (NULL pointer dereference) if the race condition leads to accessing freed memory.\n\n**CWEs Considered But Not Used:**\n\n*   **CWE-667 Improper Locking:** While RCU is a locking mechanism, the core issue is not the locking itself but the timing of accessing the data after the \"lock\" (RCU read-side critical section) is released. Therefore, this is a PEEROF relationship.\n*   **CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'):** This is a broader category, and CWE-367 is a more specific type of race condition.\n*   **CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference:** This is a potential *result* of the race condition, not the root cause itself.\n*   **CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read:** While data corruption is mentioned, there is no clear evidence of an out-of-bounds read.\n*   **CWE-824 Access of Uninitialized Pointer:** The pointer isn't necessarily uninitialized, but its contents become invalid after the RCU section.\n*   **CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling** Not applicable\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
