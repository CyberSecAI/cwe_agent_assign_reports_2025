# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-50005
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mac802154 Fix potential RCU dereference issue in mac802154_scan_worker In the `mac802154_scan_worker` function, the `scan_req->type` field was accessed after the RCU read-side critical section was unlocked. According to RCU usage rules, this is illegal and can lead to unpredictable behavior, such as accessing memory that has been updated or causing use-after-free issues. This possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developed by myself, specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues. To address this, the `scan_req->type` value is now stored in a local variable `scan_req_type` while still within the RCU read-side critical section. The `scan_req_type` is then used after the RCU lock is released, ensuring that the type value is safely accessed without violating RCU rules.
