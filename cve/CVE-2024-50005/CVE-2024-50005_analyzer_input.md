# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-50005

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mac802154 Fix potential RCU dereference issue in mac802154_scan_worker In the `mac802154_scan_worker` function, the `scan_req->type` field was accessed after the RCU read-side critical section was unlocked. According to RCU usage rules, this is illegal and can lead to unpredictable behavior, such as accessing memory that has been updated or causing use-after-free issues. This possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developed by myself, specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues. To address this, the `scan_req->type` value is now stored in a local variable `scan_req_type` while still within the RCU read-side critical section. The `scan_req_type` is then used after the RCU lock is released, ensuring that the type value is safely accessed without violating RCU rules.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper RCU usage**
- **impact:** accessing memory that has been updated and use-after-free
- **vector:** accessing scan_req->type after RCU unlock
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** mac802154_scan_worker function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `mac802154_scan_worker` function in the Linux kernel's mac802154 subsystem.
- The `scan_req->type` field, which indicates the type of scan being performed, was accessed *after* the RCU (Read-Copy-Update) read-side critical section was exited. This violates RCU usage rules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **RCU Dereference Issue:** Accessing `scan_req->type` outside of the RCU read-side critical section is a dereference violation. RCU protects shared data by allowing readers to access it without locks, but only within a critical section. After the critical section is exited, the data might be freed or modified, leading to issues.
- **Potential Use-After-Free or Data Corruption:** The illegal access could lead to unpredictable behavior, including:
    - **Use-after-free:** If the `scan_req` structure is freed after the RCU read-side critical section, accessing `scan_req->type` would result in a use-after-free.
    - **Data corruption:** If the memory where `scan_req` resides is reallocated and overwritten after the RCU read-side critical section, the read would access unrelated data or potentially cause a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:
  - **Kernel Crash:** The system could crash due to the memory access violation.
  - **Unpredictable Behavior:** The system might exhibit erratic or unexpected behavior.
  - **Potential Denial of Service:** A crash could lead to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered within the `mac802154_scan_worker` function, which is called when a scan request is processed.
- An attacker would need to trigger a scan operation in the mac802154 subsystem.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to interact with the mac802154 networking subsystem.
- This might involve:
    - Having the appropriate network interface and drivers enabled
    - Sending commands/requests to initiate scans.
- The attacker would likely require a user with sufficient privileges to interact with the networking subsystem.

**Fix:**
- The fix involves storing the value of `scan_req->type` in a local variable, `scan_req_type`, *within* the RCU read-side critical section. The local variable is then used later *outside* the RCU read-side critical section to safely access the data. This ensures the value is accessed before the `scan_req` structure can be modified or freed.
