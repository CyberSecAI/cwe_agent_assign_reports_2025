Specifically, the encrypted passwords of other administrators are accessible through the \"Log Access Event\" logs page.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-497, Information disclosure. The vulnerability lies in the fact that password hashes of administrators are exposed in the logs, which are accessible to other authenticated administrators with read-only access.\n- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker with read-only access can obtain the encrypted password hashes of other administrators. Although the passwords are encrypted, this exposure can be used in further attacks to escalate privileges.\n- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated attacker with read-only admin access navigates to the \"Log Access Event\" page within the FortiWeb GUI.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated user with read-only administrator access to FortiWeb.",

The vulnerability is caused by the exposure of sensitive system information. |\n| CWE-532 | Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. The vulnerability results in sensitive information being written to a log file. |\n| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.5 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate. The vulnerability results in exposure of sensitive information. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE, CWE-497, is a base-level CWE that describes the root cause of the vulnerability: exposure of sensitive system information. CWE-532, Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File, and CWE-200, Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor, are related as potential consequences of this initial exposure. CWE-532 is more specific than CWE-200, because the logs are the vulnerable resource.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe497 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe532\n    cwe497 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe497 primary\n    class cwe532 secondary\n    class cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **exposure of sensitive system information [CWE-497]**, specifically the encrypted administrator passwords. This information is then **inserted into the log files [CWE-532]**, which can be accessed by authenticated users, leading to an **exposure of sensitive information [CWE-200]**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly states the **rootcause** as an **exposure of sensitive system information to an unauthorized control sphere [CWE-497]**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that the \"root cause of vulnerability\" is \"Exposure of sensitive system information to an unauthorized control sphere.\" The vulnerability description also mentions the impact of the vulnerability, which is that an authenticated attacker can \"access the encrypted passwords of other administrators via the Log Access Event logs page.\" This aligns with CWE-497, which describes a scenario where sensitive system-level information can be accessed by unauthorized actors.\n\nCWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) is also considered, as the passwords are being written to a log file. This is a valid secondary CWE, as it describes how the sensitive information is being exposed.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a more general CWE, and while applicable, it is less specific than CWE-497 and CWE-532. The MITRE guidance discourages the use of CWE-200 as it is a high-level class.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-497 is a base-level CWE that accurately describes the root cause of the vulnerability. CWE-532 is also a base-level CWE that describes the mechanism by which the sensitive information is exposed.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
