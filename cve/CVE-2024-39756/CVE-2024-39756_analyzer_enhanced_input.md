## Vulnerability Description
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the adm.cgi rep_as_router() functionality of Wavlink AC3000 M33A8.V5030.210505. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to stack-based buffer overflow. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2024-39756 based on provided content:

The provided content is directly relevant to CVE-2024-39756. It's a Talos Vulnerability Report detailing a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Wavlink AC3000 router. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A buffer overflow occurs due to a lack of length checking when copying data into a buffer. Specifically, the `wl_rep_ssid2g` POST parameter in the `rep_as_router` function can exceed the allocated buffer size (0xa0 bytes) when the `ModelType` is "AP".

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-120:** Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input (‘Classic Buffer Overflow’).
*   Stack-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Arbitrary code execution. Overwriting the return address allows an attacker to redirect control flow to their own code.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An authenticated HTTP request to the `adm.cgi` script with a specially crafted `page=wzdrepeater` POST request.
*   Specifically, manipulating the `wl_rep_ssid2g` POST parameter when `ModelType` is "AP".

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Authenticated access to the router's web interface. (The report states the attacker needs to be authenticated)
*   Knowledge of the vulnerable parameters and the buffer overflow condition.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The report does not explicitly state a fix. It mentions the vendor was working on patches, but doesn't provide details.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The report provides detailed technical analysis, including code snippets and debugging information (GDB output).
*   It explains the overall architecture and how the `adm.cgi` script interacts with other components.
*   It details the timeline of vulnerability disclosure and vendor communication.
*   CVSSv3 Score: 9.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)
*   Confirmed Vulnerable Version: Wavlink AC3000 M33A8.V5030.210505
