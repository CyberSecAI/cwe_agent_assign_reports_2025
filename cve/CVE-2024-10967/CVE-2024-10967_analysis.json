  "cve_id": "CVE-2024-10967",
  "description": "A vulnerability was found in code-projects E-Health Care System 1.0. It has been classified as critical. Affected is an unknown function of the file /Doctor/delete_user_appointment_request.php. The manipulation of the argument id leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- Unfiltered user-supplied input (`$_GET['id']`) is directly incorporated into an SQL query in the `delete_user_appointment_request.php` file.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection, which arises from the lack of sanitization or parameterized queries. This allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query by injecting malicious code.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database. The provided content shows that the attacker was able to retrieve database names (`information_schema`, `bloodbank`, `crud`, etc.). It's likely that any data within these databases could also be accessed.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through manipulating the `id` parameter in an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `delete_user_appointment_request.php` file.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker doesn't need any authentication or specific privileges, since the file is accessible without authentication, which makes it easy to exploit.\n- The attacker needs to be able to send an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable file on the server.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n- The `sql.md` file provides more context than the official CVE description placeholder.\n- The vulnerability is located in the E-Health Care System.\n- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (POC) using `sqlmap` to show how an attacker can exploit this vulnerability.",

Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 895.75\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## Other CWEs Considered but Not Used:\n- CWE-74, CWE-79, CWE-138, CWE-434, CWE-1336, CWE-705, CWE-117, CWE-99, CWE-93, CWE-639, CWE-73, CWE-425, CWE-94, CWE-78, CWE-471, CWE-113, CWE-472, CWE-80, CWE-96, CWE-116\nThese CWEs were considered but ultimately not selected because they were either too general, focused on different types of vulnerabilities (e.g., Cross-site Scripting, File Upload), or at a higher level of abstraction than CWE-89. The evidence clearly points to an **SQL Injection** vulnerability due to the **improper neutralization** of input within an SQL query.\n\n\n## CWE Relationship Analysis\n\nCurrent CWEs represent these abstraction levels: .\n\n\n### Vulnerability Chain Analysis\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-471:**\n- 471 (Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)) - ROOT\n\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-94:**\n- 94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')) - ROOT\n\n\n\n### CWE Relationship Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n```",
