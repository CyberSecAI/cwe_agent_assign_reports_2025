  "description": "Vulnerability in the Oracle Communications Order and Service Management product of Oracle Communications Applications (component Security). Supported versions that are affected are 7.4.0, 7.4.1 and 7.5.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Communications Order and Service Management. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Communications Order and Service Management accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Communications Order and Service Management accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Oracle Communications Order and Service Management. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 5.5 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector (CVSS3.1/AVN/ACL/PRL/UIR/SU/CL/IL/AL).",

This is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-287, which represents improper authentication. CWE-200, which represents information exposure, is a class-level CWE and is often the result of other weaknesses, such as **missing authentication** or authorization. CWE-280 represents improper handling of permissions, which can also be related to **missing authentication**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe280[\"CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe200 -->|RELATED| cwe306\n    cwe280 -->|RELATED| cwe306\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe280 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing authentication** (CWE-306) for critical functions, which allows a low-privileged attacker to gain unauthorized access. This can lead to unauthorized data access (CWE-200) and unauthorized data modification (CWE-280), as well as a partial denial of service.\n\nCWE-306 (Missing Authentication) -> CWE-200 (Information Exposure) / CWE-280 (Improper Permissions) -> Impact (Data Modification, DoS)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **missing authentication** for critical functions (CWE-306). The vulnerability description states that a low-privileged attacker can compromise the system via HTTP, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, and denial of service. This strongly suggests that authentication is either **missing** entirely or is insufficient to protect critical functions.\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information) and CWE-280 (Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges) are possible secondary weaknesses that stem from the **missing authentication**. If authentication were properly implemented, the attacker would not be able to access or modify data.\n\nThe selection of CWE-306 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: the **lack of authentication** for critical functions.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
