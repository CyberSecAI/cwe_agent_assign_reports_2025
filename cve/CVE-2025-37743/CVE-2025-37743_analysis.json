  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi ath12k Avoid **memory leak** while enabling statistics Driver uses monitor destination rings for extended statistics mode and standalone monitor mode. In extended statistics mode, TLVs are parsed from the buffer received from the monitor destination ring and assigned to the ppdu_info structure to update per-packet statistics. In standalone monitor mode, along with per-packet statistics, the packet data (payload) is captured, and the driver updates per MSDU to mac80211. When the AP interface is enabled, only extended statistics mode is activated. As part of enabling monitor rings for collecting statistics, the driver subscribes to HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV in the filter configuration. This TLV is received from the monitor destination ring, and kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object occurs, which is not freed, leading to a **memory leak**. The kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object is only required while enabling the standalone monitor interface. This causes a **memory leak** while enabling extended statistics mode in the driver. Fix this **memory leak** by removing the kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object in the HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV handling. Additionally, remove the standalone monitor mode handlings in the HAL_MON_BUF_ADDR and HAL_RX_MSDU_END TLVs. These TLV tags will be handled properly when enabling standalone monitor mode in the future.

The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**memory leak**\" |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary identified CWE is CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime), which is at the Variant level. There are no direct parent-child relationships or chain relationships that strongly influence the selection in this case, as the vulnerability description focuses on a specific **memory leak** issue. Other potential CWEs such as resource initialization and pointer issues were considered, but the direct evidence of a **memory leak** makes CWE-401 the most appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe401 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of the following:\n1.  A `kzalloc` call is made for the `mon_mpdu` object.\n2.  The allocated memory is not freed when the extended statistics mode is enabled, leading to a **memory leak**.\n    *   **Root Cause:** CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime)\n    *   **Impact:** Resource exhaustion due to the unreleased memory.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis, based on the vulnerability description, identifies a clear **memory leak** caused by the missing release of memory allocated for the `mon_mpdu` object.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states: \"This TLV is received from the monitor destination ring, and kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object occurs, which is not freed, leading to a **memory leak**.\"\n\nThe evidence directly supports the selection of CWE-401, which is at the optimal level of specificity (Variant). The other CWEs were not selected because they represent different aspects of software weaknesses (e.g., out-of-bounds read, race condition) that are not directly described in the vulnerability report.
