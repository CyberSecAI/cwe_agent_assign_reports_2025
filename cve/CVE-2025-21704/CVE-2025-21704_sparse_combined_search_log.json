  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved usb cdc-acm Check control transfer buffer size before access If the first fragment is shorter than struct usb_cdc_notification, we cant calculate an expected_size. Log an error and discard the notification instead of reading lengths from memory outside the received data, which can lead to memory corruption when the expected_size decreases between fragments, causing `expected_size - acm->nb_index` to wrap. This issue has been present since the beginning of git history however, it only leads to memory corruption since commit ea2583529cd1 (cdc-acm reassemble fragmented notifications). A mitigating factor is that acm_ctrl_irq() can only execute after userspace has opened /dev/ttyACM* but if ModemManager is running, ModemManager will do that automatically depending on the USB devices vendor/product IDs and its other interfaces.",
