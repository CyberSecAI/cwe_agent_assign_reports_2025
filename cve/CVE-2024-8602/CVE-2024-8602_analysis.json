  "description": "When the XML is read from the codes in the PDF and parsed using a DocumentBuilder, the **default settings of the DocumentBuilder allow for an **XXE**** (XML External Entity) attack. Further information on this can be found on the website of the Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP). An attacker could theoretically leverage this by delivering a manipulated PDF file to the target, and depending on the environment, various actions can be executed. These actions include * Reading files from the operating system * Crashing the thread handling the parsing or causing it to enter an infinite loop * Executing HTTP requests * Loading additional DTDs or XML files * Under certain conditions, executing OS commands",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe root cause is the use of an outdated and vulnerable Java library (`taxstatement.jar`) in multiple Swiss tax applications. This library uses the `DocumentBuilderFactory` without proper configuration to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **XXE Vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is an XML External Entity (XXE) injection flaw. The `DocumentBuilderFactory` is not configured to disallow processing of `DOCTYPE` declarations which allows for an attacker to include external entities in the XML data.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially leak sensitive information by forcing the application to read local files (through file paths) or make requests to external resources (through URLs).\n- **NTLM Hash Leakage:** The attacker can potentially leak NTLMv2 hashes by directing the application to access a remote SMB share with a malicious DTD file.\n- **Denial of Service:** The attacker can crash the tax application.\n- **Arbitrary HTTP GET Requests:** The attacker can make arbitrary HTTP GET requests.\n- Potential for more severe impact on servers or web applications if the vulnerable library is used in such a context.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Malicious XML Data:** The primary attack vector is through crafted XML data that includes malicious external entity declarations.\n- **Barcodes:** The attack data can be delivered through barcodes embedded in PDF documents. These PDFs are used as \"e-tax statement files.\"\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Ability to Craft Malicious XML:**  The attacker needs to be able to craft XML with malicious external entities.\n- **Ability to Generate PDF with malicious XML:** The attacker needs to be able to generate a PDF document containing the malicious XML data serialized into barcodes.\n- **Access to vulnerable application:** The attacker needs access to a system running one of the vulnerable tax applications and be able to import a malicious PDF (e-tax statement file).\n- **Social engineering (optional):** The blog post mentions the author got sample XML data from a bank via social engineering. Though this was for test data, it demonstrates how obtaining the e-tax statement files may be possible through social engineering.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerable library, `taxstatement.jar`, is used across multiple tax applications from different cantons in Switzerland.\n- The library is distributed by the SSK (Schweizerischen Steuerkonferenz) to cantons and banks for use in their applications.\n- The library parses XML data extracted from barcodes in PDF documents.\n- Some applications exhibit a double-render vulnerability where the XML data is parsed twice.\n- The fix for the vulnerability involves disabling processing of `DOCTYPE` declarations when parsing XML.\n- The SSK has released version 2.2.4.1 of the library that addresses the issue.\n\nThe content provides more detail than the standard CVE description, explaining the context, the attack vector via barcodes, the vulnerable applications, the library distribution mechanism, and the coordinated vulnerability disclosure process.",

CWE-611 focuses on the general issue of improper restriction of XML external entities, while CWE-776 is a more specific case dealing with recursive entity references in DTDs (Document Type Definitions). Both are at the Base level of abstraction. There is no direct parent-child relationship between these CWEs, but they can be considered peer vulnerabilities within the realm of XML security.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe611[\"CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\"]\n    cwe776[\"CWE-776: Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe611 primary\n    class cwe776 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **default settings of the DocumentBuilder allowing for an XXE**, which leads to the potential for:\n\n1.  Reading files from the operating system\n2.  Crashing the thread handling the parsing or causing it to enter an infinite loop\n3.  Executing HTTP requests\n4.  Loading additional DTDs or XML files\n5.  Under certain conditions, executing OS commands\n\nThe root cause is the **XXE** vulnerability. This is directly caused by the **improper configuration of the DocumentBuilderFactory**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary vulnerability is CWE-611 [CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference] due to the **default settings of the DocumentBuilder allowing for an XXE**, as explicitly stated in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section also confirms this, stating that the `DocumentBuilderFactory` is not configured to disallow processing of `DOCTYPE` declarations, leading to the **XXE vulnerability**. The impact of this vulnerability includes information disclosure, denial of service, and arbitrary HTTP GET requests, which are all consequences of a successful XXE attack.\n\nCWE-776 [CWE-776: Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')] is a secondary candidate because the vulnerability description mentions the possibility of causing the parsing thread to enter an infinite loop, which could be related to recursive entity expansion. However, the primary issue is the **XXE** vulnerability, not specifically the recursive entity expansion.\n\nThe evidence strongly supports CWE-611 as the primary CWE. While CWE-776 could be a contributing factor, it's not the main root cause. Therefore, I'm assigning CWE-611 with high confidence (1.0) and CWE-776 as a secondary consideration with a lower confidence (0.7).\n\nThe retriever results also support this conclusion, with CWE-611 having the highest score.\n\nThe mapping guidance for both CWE-611 and CWE-776 indicates that they are at the Base level of abstraction and are ALLOWED for mapping, which further supports their selection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n* CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n* CWE-776: Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')",
