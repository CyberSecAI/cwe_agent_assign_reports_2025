# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-8602

## Vulnerability Description
When the XML is read from the codes in the PDF and parsed using a DocumentBuilder, the **default settings of the DocumentBuilder allow for an **XXE**** (XML External Entity) attack. Further information on this can be found on the website of the Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP). An attacker could theoretically leverage this by delivering a manipulated PDF file to the target, and depending on the environment, various actions can be executed. These actions include * Reading files from the operating system * Crashing the thread handling the parsing or causing it to enter an infinite loop * Executing HTTP requests * Loading additional DTDs or XML files * Under certain conditions, executing OS commands

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **default settings of the DocumentBuilder allow for an XXE**
- **weakness:** **XXE**
- **impact:** Reading files from the operating system and Crashing the thread handling the parsing or causing it to enter an infinite loop and Executing HTTP requests and Loading additional DTDs or XML files and Under certain conditions, executing OS commands
- **vector:** malicious PDF file
- **attacker:** attacker

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the use of an outdated and vulnerable Java library (`taxstatement.jar`) in multiple Swiss tax applications. This library uses the `DocumentBuilderFactory` without proper configuration to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XXE Vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is an XML External Entity (XXE) injection flaw. The `DocumentBuilderFactory` is not configured to disallow processing of `DOCTYPE` declarations which allows for an attacker to include external entities in the XML data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially leak sensitive information by forcing the application to read local files (through file paths) or make requests to external resources (through URLs).
- **NTLM Hash Leakage:** The attacker can potentially leak NTLMv2 hashes by directing the application to access a remote SMB share with a malicious DTD file.
- **Denial of Service:** The attacker can crash the tax application.
- **Arbitrary HTTP GET Requests:** The attacker can make arbitrary HTTP GET requests.
- Potential for more severe impact on servers or web applications if the vulnerable library is used in such a context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious XML Data:** The primary attack vector is through crafted XML data that includes malicious external entity declarations.
- **Barcodes:** The attack data can be delivered through barcodes embedded in PDF documents. These PDFs are used as "e-tax statement files."

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft Malicious XML:**  The attacker needs to be able to craft XML with malicious external entities.
- **Ability to Generate PDF with malicious XML:** The attacker needs to be able to generate a PDF document containing the malicious XML data serialized into barcodes.
- **Access to vulnerable application:** The attacker needs access to a system running one of the vulnerable tax applications and be able to import a malicious PDF (e-tax statement file).
- **Social engineering (optional):** The blog post mentions the author got sample XML data from a bank via social engineering. Though this was for test data, it demonstrates how obtaining the e-tax statement files may be possible through social engineering.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable library, `taxstatement.jar`, is used across multiple tax applications from different cantons in Switzerland.
- The library is distributed by the SSK (Schweizerischen Steuerkonferenz) to cantons and banks for use in their applications.
- The library parses XML data extracted from barcodes in PDF documents.
- Some applications exhibit a double-render vulnerability where the XML data is parsed twice.
- The fix for the vulnerability involves disabling processing of `DOCTYPE` declarations when parsing XML.
- The SSK has released version 2.2.4.1 of the library that addresses the issue.
