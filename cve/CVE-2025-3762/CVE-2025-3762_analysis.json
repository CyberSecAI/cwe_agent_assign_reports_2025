  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-3762 Content\n\nThis content **RELATES** to a vulnerability in PCMan FTP Server, specifically a buffer overflow in the `MPUT` command. It provides a detailed exploit script.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `MPUT` command handling of PCMan FTP Server version 2.0.7. The server does not properly validate the size of the input provided with the `MPUT` command, allowing an attacker to send a payload larger than the allocated buffer.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Buffer Overflow\n*   Improper Input Validation\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation allows the attacker to overwrite the execution flow of the program, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. The exploit script aims to redirect execution to a shellcode payload.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Remote attacker can send a crafted `MPUT` command to the FTP server.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Network access to the FTP server.\n*   Ability to send arbitrary data to the FTP server on port 21.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not provide information about a specific fix. However, the root cause suggests that proper input validation and buffer size checks in the `MPUT` command handling are necessary to mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **Version Affected:** 2.0.7\n*   **Tested on:** Windows XP SP3 (Build 2600)\n*   **Exploit Details:** The script uses `msfvenom` to generate shellcode for Windows, specifically a reverse TCP shell.\n*   **Offset:** The exploit uses an offset of 2006 bytes to reach the EIP register.\n*   **EIP overwrite:** The exploit overwrites EIP with `0x74e32fd9` (JMP ESP).\n*   **Bad Characters:** The exploit avoids using null bytes (`\\x00`), line feeds (`\\x0a`), and carriage returns (`\\x0d`).\n*   **Exploit Script:** The provided Perl script demonstrates a complete exploit, including connecting to the FTP server, authenticating as an anonymous user, and sending the malicious `MPUT` command.\n*   **LHOST/LPORT:** The exploit is configured to connect back to `192.168.176.136` on port `4444`.\n*   **NOP sled:** The exploit uses a 20-byte NOP sled (`\\x90`x20) before the shellcode.",

It is a more specific case of the class-level CWE-119. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **buffer overflow** due to the MPUT command handler, and the CVE reference confirms this. CWE-120 is the most precise and applicable CWE based on the available information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe120 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n1.  The vulnerability begins with a **buffer overflow** in the MPUT command handler due to the lack of input size validation. (CWE-120)\n2.  This leads to potential arbitrary code execution by overwriting program memory.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis indicated a **buffer overflow** vulnerability. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference links confirms the **buffer overflow** in the `MPUT` command handler of the PCMan FTP Server. The root cause is the lack of input size validation during the buffer copy operation, which directly corresponds to CWE-120. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-120 is a specific type of CWE-119, but CWE-120 is a better fit due to its specific description of a \"Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input\". The evidence is strong and directly supports the classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
