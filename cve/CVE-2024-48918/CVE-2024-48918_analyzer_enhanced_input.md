## Vulnerability Description
RDS Light is a simplified version of the Reflective Dialogue System (RDS), a self-reflecting AI framework. Versions prior to 1.1.0 contain a vulnerability that involves a **lack of input validation** within the RDS AI framework, specifically within the user input handling code in the main module (`main.py`). This leaves the framework open to injection attacks and potential memory tampering. Any user or external actor providing input to the system could exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious commands, corrupt stored data, or affect API calls. This is particularly critical for users employing RDS AI in production environments where it interacts with sensitive systems, performs dynamic memory caching, or retrieves user-specific data for analysis. Impacted areas include developers using the RDS AI system as a backend for AI-driven applications and systems running RDS AI that may be exposed to untrusted environments or receive unverified user inputs. The vulnerability has been patched in version 1.1.0 of the RDS AI framework. All user inputs are now sanitized and validated against a set of rules designed to mitigate malicious content. Users should upgrade to version 1.1.0 or higher and ensure all dependencies are updated to their latest versions. For users unable to upgrade to the patched version, a workaround can be implemented. The user implementing the workaround should implement custom validation checks for user inputs to filter out unsafe characters and patterns (e.g., SQ

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-48918:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation within the RDS AI framework, specifically in the `main.py` module, where user input is handled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** User-provided inputs are not properly sanitized or validated before being processed by the system.
- **Injection Vulnerability:** The lack of input sanitization creates an injection vulnerability where malicious commands, code or other malicious content can be embedded in the user input.
- **Potential Memory Tampering:** Unvalidated inputs can potentially be used to corrupt stored data or affect API calls, leading to memory tampering or related issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Injection Attacks:** Attackers can inject malicious commands or code into the system.
- **Data Corruption:** Exploitation can lead to the corruption of stored data.
- **API Call Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate API calls through injected input.
- **System Compromise:** In severe scenarios, the system's integrity and operation can be compromised.
- **Sensitive data exposure:** If not properly sanitized, user data could be exposed to other users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User Input:** Any user or external actor providing input to the system can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Untrusted Environments:** Systems running RDS AI in untrusted environments or systems that handle unverified user inputs are more susceptible.
- **API interaction:** External actors using the API could potentially inject malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Input:** An attacker needs to be able to provide input to the RDS AI system, either directly or through an interface.
- **Knowledge of System:**  While specific system knowledge might enhance the attack, the basic lack of input validation allows even naive attackers to cause harm.

**Additional Details from the Patched Commit:**
- **Input Sanitization Implementation:** The patch includes the implementation of `sanitize_input()` function in `main.py` which does the following sanitization:
    - `strip()` removes leading/trailing whitespace from user input
    - `[:500]` limits the input to 500 characters
    - `re.sub(r"[\'\";<>]", '', sanitized_input)` removes characters like `'`, `"`, `;`, `<`, and `>` which are known to be used for injection attacks.
    - `prohibited_phrases` defines a list of phrases to remove from user input like "ignore", "forget", "shutdown", "delete", "system" and "exit" to avoid direct manipulation of the AI.
- **Safe Prompt Creation:** A `build_safe_prompt` function is also introduced which uses `sanitize_input()` to create a prompt that would be safer to pass to the AI.
- **Vulnerability Fix:** The patch in the commit `7dac0e214a344447a2a8ea7414188c38c6a61a6e` aims to fix the vulnerability by sanitizing user inputs.
- **Affected Versions:** Versions prior to `1.1.0` of RDS Light are affected.
- **Resolution:** Upgrade to version `1.1.0` of RDS Light or implement manual input validation and limit/remove the usage of user input.
