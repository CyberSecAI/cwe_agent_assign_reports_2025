## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Root Cause:** The idccms V1.35 application does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Weaknesses:**
*   Lack of CSRF protection: The application doesn't implement proper CSRF mitigation techniques like anti-CSRF tokens or checking the "Origin" or "Referer" headers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can force an authenticated user's browser to send malicious requests to the vulnerable application.
*   In this specific case, the attacker can delete a software backup by targeting the `softBak_deal.php` endpoint with the `mudi=del&dataID=2` parameters.
*   Other administrative actions might be vulnerable via similar attacks if other endpoints lack proper CSRF protections.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack is performed via a malicious HTML page hosted by the attacker.
*   The attacker crafts a form that submits a request to the vulnerable endpoint on the target application.
*   The attacker tricks an authenticated user to visit the malicious HTML page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be able to host a malicious website or inject HTML into a vulnerable site.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and its parameters.
*   The user must be authenticated on the targeted idccms application.

**Additional Details:**
*   The proof of concept (PoC) provided in the content includes the HTML form that can be used to trigger the CSRF attack. The form automatically submits using javascript.
*   The specific vulnerable component is located at `http://127.0.0.1:80/admin/softBak_deal.php?mudi=del&dataID=2`
*   The target system uses the domain `idccms.com`.
*   The vulnerable application is idccms V1.35.
