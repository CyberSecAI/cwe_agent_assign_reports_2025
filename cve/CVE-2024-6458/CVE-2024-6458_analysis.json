  "description": "The WooCommerce Product Table Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized post title modification due to a missing capability check on the wcpt_presets__duplicate_preset_to_table function in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber access and above to change titles of arbitrary posts. Missing sanitization can lead to Stored **Cross-Site Scripting** when viewed by an admin via the WooCommerce Product Table.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6458\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `wcpt_presets__duplicate_preset_to_table` function within the `presets/presets.php` file of the WooCommerce Product Table Lite plugin.\n- Specifically, there isn't a capability check to verify if the user has the necessary permissions to perform this action.\n- Additionally, missing sanitization of the post title leads to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Missing Authorization:** The `wcpt_presets__duplicate_preset_to_table` function lacks a capability check, allowing unauthorized users to execute it.\n- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin doesn't sanitize the post title, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability when an admin views the modified title.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized Post Title Modification:** Attackers with subscriber-level access or higher can modify the titles of arbitrary posts within WordPress.\n- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the post title. When an administrator views the affected post title, the malicious script will execute, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions with admin privileges, such as cookie theft, data exfiltration, or further compromise of the site.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The attack vector is through the WordPress admin panel.\n- The vulnerability is triggered when a user with minimal permissions (subscriber or higher) accesses the table editor and manipulates the `wcpt_preset` and `post_id` parameters to trigger the vulnerable function.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level access to the WordPress site.\n- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the WordPress admin interface.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerable function is located in `/wc-product-table-lite/trunk/presets/presets.php`\n- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 3.5.1.\n- The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.8.6.\n- The fix included adding a capability check to the `wcpt_presets__duplicate_preset_to_table` function, ensuring that only users with the \"create_wc_product_tables\" capability can execute it and sanitizing the post title.\n\nThis information provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability, its causes, impacts, and how to mitigate it.",

This is represented by CWE-862. The secondary weakness is the resulting **Cross-Site Scripting**, due to **missing sanitization**. This is represented by CWE-79. CWE-862 is a Class, but a more specific base CWE was not available in the retriever results.

The next link is the **missing sanitization**, which results in **Cross-Site Scripting** (CWE-79).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified two key weaknesses: **missing authorization** and **Cross-Site Scripting**. The **missing authorization** is the root cause, allowing unauthorized users to modify post titles. The **Cross-Site Scripting** is a consequence of **missing sanitization**.\n\nThe evidence for **missing authorization** is strong, with the vulnerability description explicitly stating a \"**missing capability check**\" on the `wcpt_presets__duplicate_preset_to_table` function. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms this, stating: \"The vulnerability stems from a **missing authorization** check\". The retriever results also listed CWE-862 (**Missing Authorization**) as a potential candidate.\n\nThe evidence for **Cross-Site Scripting** is also strong, with the vulnerability description stating that \"**missing sanitization** can lead to Stored **Cross-Site Scripting**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating: \"Additionally, **missing sanitization** of the post title leads to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\". The retriever results also listed CWE-79 (**Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**) as a potential candidate.\n\nCWE-862 is a Class, but no suitable base CWE was found in the retriever results.
