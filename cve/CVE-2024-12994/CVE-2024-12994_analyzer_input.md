# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-12994

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in running-elephant Datart 1.0.0-rc3. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is the function extractModel of the file /import of the component File Upload. The manipulation of the argument file leads to **deserialization**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **deserialization**
- **vector:** manipulation of the argument file
- **product:** running-elephant Datart
- **version:** 1.0.0-rc3
- **component:** File Upload

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content describes a deserialization vulnerability in Datart version 1.0.0-rc.3 or earlier.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `extractModel(MultipartFile file)` method within the `datart.server.service.impl.VizServiceImpl` class. This method directly deserializes the contents of an uploaded file using `ObjectInputStream` without proper validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unsafe deserialization of user-supplied data.
- Lack of input validation and sanitization on the uploaded file.
- Usage of `ObjectInputStream` to directly deserialize the file content, which is vulnerable to object injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by uploading a malicious serialized object.
- Full server compromise: The attacker could gain complete control over the affected server and perform any action.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  Uploading a malicious file via the `/import` endpoint, which passes the file to the vulnerable `extractModel` method.
- The vulnerability is exposed through the `importViz` method.
- HTTP POST request to the `/import` endpoint with a file parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to authenticate to the application, as the login process is required to access the vulnerable `/import` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious serialized object using tools like ysoserial or similar means and deliver this to the vulnerable endpoint
