# Vulnerability Description

    **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer** vulnerability in Arm Ltd Valhall GPU Firmware, Arm Ltd Arm 5th Gen GPU Architecture Firmware allows a local non-privileged user to make improper GPU processing operations to access a limited amount outside of buffer bounds. If the operations are carefully prepared, then this in turn could give them access to all system memory. This issue affects Valhall GPU Firmware from r29p0 through r46p0 Arm 5th Gen GPU Architecture Firmware from r41p0 through r46p0.
