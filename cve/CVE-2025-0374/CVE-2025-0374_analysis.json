  "description": "When etcupdate encounters conflicts while merging files, it saves a version containing conflict markers in /var/db/etcupdate/conflicts. This version does not preserve the mode of the input file, and is world-readable. This applies to files that would normally have restricted visibility, such as /etc/master.passwd. An unprivileged local user may be able to read encrypted root and user passwords from the temporary master.passwd file created in /var/db/etcupdate/conflicts. This is possible only when conflicts within the password file arise during an update, and the unprotected file is deleted when conflicts are resolved.",

The content from security.netapp.com is unusable as it requires JavaScript.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the FreeBSD security advisory:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nWhen `etcupdate` encounters conflicts during file merging, it saves a version with conflict markers to `/var/db/etcupdate/conflicts`. This temporary file does not preserve the original file's permissions and is world-readable.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Insecure file permissions on conflict files created by `etcupdate`.\n*   Loss of file mode (permissions) during conflict resolution.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAn unprivileged local user can read sensitive information, specifically encrypted root and user passwords, from the temporary `master.passwd` file if conflicts arise during an update and the unprotected file is not promptly deleted.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Local access to a FreeBSD system.\n*   Triggering conflicts during an `etcupdate` operation (e.g., by manually modifying files that `etcupdate` manages).\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Unprivileged local user account on the affected FreeBSD system.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade to a supported FreeBSD stable or release/security branch dated after the correction date (January 28, 2025, or January 29, 2025, depending on the branch).\n*   Update via `freebsd-update(8)` or by applying the provided patch and recompiling the system.\n*   Avoid using `etcupdate` if possible, and use `freebsd-update(8)` instead.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   Specific Git commit hashes are provided for each affected branch, allowing for precise identification of the fix.\n*   Instructions for updating via binary patch (`freebsd-update`) and source code patch are detailed.\n*   Affected FreeBSD versions are explicitly listed (13.4, 14.1, 14.2).\n*   The advisory includes information about verifying the patch's signature using GPG.",

The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors. |\n| CWE-276 | Incorrect Default Permissions | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. During installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those files. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the hierarchical relationship between CWE-732 and its potential children and the relationship with CWE-276. CWE-732 is a Class-level CWE, and while there might be more specific child CWEs, the description aligns well with the general concept of incorrect permission assignment for critical resources. CWE-276 is considered as a secondary weakness because it describes the specific scenario of incorrect *default* permissions.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe276[\"CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions\"]\n    \n    cwe276 -->|PEEROF| cwe732\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe732 primary\n    class cwe276 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the `etcupdate` tool creating a temporary file during conflict resolution. This file is then assigned incorrect permissions, specifically world-readable permissions, leading to the exposure of sensitive information such as encrypted passwords.\n\nRoot Cause: **Incorrect permissions assigned** to the temporary file by `etcupdate`.\nWeakness: **World-readable** `master.passwd` file in `/var/db/etcupdate/conflicts`.\nImpact: An unprivileged local user can read encrypted root and user passwords.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **weakness** of the world-readable file and the root cause of the incorrect permission assignment. The retriever results suggested CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) and CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions), among others.\n\nThe evidence supporting CWE-732 is the description: \"When etcupdate encounters conflicts while merging files, it saves a version containing conflict markers in /var/db/etcupdate/conflicts. This version does not preserve the mode of the input file, and is world-readable.\" This indicates that the critical resource, the `master.passwd` file, is being created with incorrect permissions.\n\nCWE-276 is a good secondary candidate, as this issue is caused by a failure of `etcupdate` to correctly apply default file permissions.\n\nThe graph relationships confirmed that both CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-732 being a broader category encompassing the specific instance of incorrect default permissions represented by CWE-276.\n\nThe final decision is to map the vulnerability to CWE-732 as the primary cause, with CWE-276 as a secondary contributing factor to this issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nDuring installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nOpening temporary files without appropriate measures or controls can leave the file, its contents and any function that it impacts vulnerable to attack.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
