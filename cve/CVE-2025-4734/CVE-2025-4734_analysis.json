Here's the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n* A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the '/pages/ci\\_update.php' file of the 'Sales and Inventory System' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter 'name' and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n* SQL injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n* Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n* The vulnerability is present in the `/pages/ci_update.php` file.\n* The 'name' parameter is vulnerable.\n* No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n* An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/pages/ci_update.php` endpoint.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n* Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n* Input validation and filtering.\n* Minimize database user permissions.\n* Regular security audits.\n\n**Additional details (more than the CVE description):**\n\n*   The content provides specific payloads for exploiting the vulnerability (boolean-based blind and error-based).\n*   Screenshots from `sqlmap` are included, demonstrating the vulnerability.\n*   The affected version is V1.0 of the \"campcodes Sales and Inventory System\".\n*   Links to the vendor's homepage and software download are provided.",
