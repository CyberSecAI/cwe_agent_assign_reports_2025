# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-11523

## Description

IrfanView DXF File Parsing Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a **memory corruption** condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24597.

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** results in a **memory corruption** leading to an out-of-bounds write.|
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate: The root cause is **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is that CWE-787 is a potential consequence of CWE-20. The vulnerability stems from the lack of input validation, which then leads to memory corruption manifested as an out-of-bounds write. While CWE-20 is a general class, CWE-787 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability's manifestation.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-20), leading to a **memory corruption** condition (CWE-787), and ultimately resulting in Remote Code Execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment pointed to CWE-787 as the primary weakness due to the memory corruption condition described in the vulnerability. The root cause, a **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, aligns with CWE-20.

The graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting how improper input validation can lead to memory corruption and out-of-bounds writes. CWE-787 provides a more specific description of the memory corruption, which is the direct consequence of the initial flaw.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent both the root cause (CWE-20) and the specific type of memory corruption (CWE-787) involved in the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.



## CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available. It also overlaps existing CWE entries and might be deprecated in the future.



## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write

**Similarity Score**: 1007.75
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 981.47
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().

## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 975.48
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:

        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the
        properties that are required to process the data safely and
        correctly.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could
