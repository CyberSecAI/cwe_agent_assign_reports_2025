## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/xe Use reserved copy engine for user binds on faulting devices User binds map to engines with **can fault, faults depend on user binds completion**, thus we can **deadlock**. Avoid this by using reserved copy engine for user binds on faulting devices. While we are here, normalize bind queue creation with a helper. v2 - Pass in extensions to bind queue creation (CI) v3 - s/resevered/reserved (Lucas) - Fix NULL hwe check (Jonathan)

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **can fault, faults depend on user binds completion**
- **weakness:** **deadlock**
- **vector:** User binds map to engines with can fault
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** drm/xe

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to a patch that addresses a potential deadlock in the Intel Xe DRM driver.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from user binds (memory mappings) being associated with engines that can fault. The handling of these faults depends on the completion of user binds. This creates a circular dependency, leading to a potential deadlock where user binds are waiting for fault resolution, and fault resolution is waiting for user bind completion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Deadlock:** The primary weakness is the potential for a deadlock. User-initiated memory binding operations can be stalled indefinitely if they occur on a faulting engine, creating a dependency loop with fault resolution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- System or GPU hang: A deadlock would lead to a system hang or prevent GPU resources from being accessible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A user-mode process can trigger this vulnerability by initiating memory binding operations on a faulting engine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create memory mappings on an Intel GPU that uses the `xe` DRM driver. This requires the ability to use the DRM API for memory management and have a capable Intel GPU.
- The attacker does not require elevated privileges.

**Mitigation:**
- The patch resolves the issue by using a reserved copy engine for user binds on faulting devices. This avoids the circular dependency.
- The patch also normalizes bind queue creation with a helper function to manage the selection of the appropriate engine.
