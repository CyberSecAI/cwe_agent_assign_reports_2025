## Vulnerability Description
**Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** vulnerability in MESbook 20221021.03 version. An unauthenticated remote attacker can use the message parameter to inject a payload with dangerous JavaScript code, causing the application to loop requests on itself, which could lead to resource consumption and disable the application.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**
- **impact:** resource consumption and disable the application
- **vector:** inject a payload with dangerous JavaScript code
- **attacker:** unauthenticated remote attacker
- **product:** MESbook
- **version:** 20221021.03

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-6427:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the application's failure to properly sanitize the "message" parameter, which allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation of the "message" parameter
- Vulnerability to JavaScript injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated remote attacker can inject malicious Javascript code, causing the application to loop requests on itself, leading to resource consumption.
- Denial of Service (DoS) by potentially overwhelming the server with excessive requests.
- The application may become disabled.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote unauthenticated attacker.
- Injection of a malicious Javascript payload via the `message` parameter

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the affected application.
- No prior authentication is needed.
