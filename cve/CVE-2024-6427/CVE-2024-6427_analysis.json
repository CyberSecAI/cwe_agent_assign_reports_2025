However, based on the provided description, CWE-400 directly addresses the **uncontrolled resource consumption** issue. There is also a relationship between the **injection** of Javascript and XSS.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -->|CANRESULTIN| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper input validation** that allows the injection of malicious Javascript code. This leads to the application looping requests on itself, which results in **uncontrolled resource consumption** and ultimately disables the application.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-400 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of **\"Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"** in the vulnerability description. The evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary supports this, stating that the application's failure to properly sanitize the \"message\" parameter allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code, leading to resource consumption and potential denial of service. While CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE, it directly reflects the core issue described.\n\nCWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) was considered because the vulnerability involves the injection of JavaScript code. However, the primary impact described is resource consumption, not necessarily the execution of arbitrary code in a user's browser. Therefore, CWE-79 is a secondary weakness that contributes to the primary issue of resource exhaustion.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-400 is based on the direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. It represents the root cause of the problem.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-405: Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control situations in which an adversary can cause the product to consume or produce excessive resources without requiring the adversary to invest equivalent work or otherwise prove authorization, i.e., the adversary's influence is \"asymmetric.\"\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This was not selected because the vulnerability description doesn't focus on the asymmetric aspect of the resource consumption, but on the general uncontrolled consumption.*\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This was not selected because the vulnerability is not specifically about excessive memory allocation, but about the broader issue of uncontrolled resource usage, which may include CPU, network bandwidth, etc.*\n\n## CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs multiple related behaviors, but the behaviors are performed in the wrong order in ways which may produce resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This was not selected because the vulnerability does not directly relate to an incorrect order of operations.*\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n\n*This was selected as the PRIMARY because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions **\"Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"**.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

The injection of malicious code to make the app loop to itself is the **rootcause**, and **uncontrolled resource consumption** is the impact.*\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This was not selected because it focuses on external control of immutable parameters, not the broader issue of resource consumption due to injected code.*\n\n## CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an externally controlled name or reference that resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
