The login flow generates a link to be pasted in the browser, and then polls every 10 seconds for the `/v3-public/authTokens/<token name>` endpoint. The `<token name>` is randomly generated by the CLI.\n- Required attacker capabilities/position:\nAn unauthenticated user.\n- Mitigation or fix:\nThe fix involves removing GET and DELETE methods for the authTokens collection. Patched versions include releases `v2.8.13`, `v2.9.7` and `v2.10.3`.\n- More detail than the official CVE description:\nYes\n```",

The vulnerability description clearly indicates an exposure of sensitive information, making CWE-200 a strong candidate. The retriever results also support this, though CWE-200 is a Class level. The guidance suggests using a Base level CWE where possible, but no Base level CWE is a clear and strong match. CWE-306 and CWE-285 are considered as secondary candidates.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor** (CWE-200), allowing unauthenticated users to list and delete CLI authentication tokens. This can then lead to users being prevented from logging in via the CLI. There is potentially a **missing authentication** (CWE-306) or **improper authorization** (CWE-285) issue involved, but the primary issue is the exposure itself.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nMy assessment is primarily based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The key phrase \"exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor\" and the summary stating \"An unauthenticated user can list all CLI authentication tokens\" directly support the selection of CWE-200.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the potential for more specific CWEs related to authentication and authorization. However, the core issue remains the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nCWE-200 is selected as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **exposure of sensitive information**. While CWE-306 and CWE-285 could potentially be contributing factors, they are not the primary weakness. The chosen CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately reflects the vulnerability without being overly broad or narrow.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
