## Vulnerability Description
The Tainacan plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a **missing capability check** on the get_file function in all versions up to, and including, 0.21.7. The function is also vulnerable to **directory traversal**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **missing capability check**
- **weakness:** **directory traversal**
- **impact:** unauthorized access of data
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access and above
- **product:** Tainacan plugin for WordPress
- **version:** up to and including 0.21.7
- **component:** get_file function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7135:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check within the `get_file` function of the Tainacan plugin's REST API. Specifically, the function does not properly verify if the user has the necessary permissions to access the requested file. Additionally, the function is vulnerable to directory traversal, allowing an attacker to read files outside of the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The `get_file` function lacks a capability check, which would verify if the authenticated user has the right to access the file.
*   **Directory Traversal:** The function is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks, which could allow the attacker to access arbitrary files on the server, not just the ones intended to be accessed by the endpoint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as:
    *   Configuration files with database credentials
    *   User data
    *   Application source code
    *   Other sensitive data

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network via the REST API endpoint.
*   **Direct Request:** The attacker would need to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `tainacan/v2/bg-processes/file` endpoint, including a `guid` parameter with a path to the file that is intended to be read. The path is also vulnerable to directory traversal attempts, in order to read files outside of the intended directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with at least Subscriber level privileges.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site where the vulnerable plugin is installed.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability is present in all versions of the Tainacan plugin up to and including 0.21.7.
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.21.8.
* The vulnerable code can be found in the `class-tainacan-rest-background-processes-controller.php` file of the plugin.
* The file path is validated via `realpath()`, however, `strpos()` is not a suitable way to check for path traversal, and bypasses the check with techniques like `../` and similar.
