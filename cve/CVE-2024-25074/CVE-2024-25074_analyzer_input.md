## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-25074:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the baseband software not properly validating a pointer provided by the Session Management (SM) module before dereferencing it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Untrusted Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is that the software blindly trusts a pointer supplied by the SM module without any checks. This lack of validation can lead to the software attempting to access arbitrary memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact of this vulnerability is a denial-of-service condition. When the software dereferences an invalid pointer, it is likely to cause a crash, making the device unusable until restarted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves manipulating the pointer provided by the Session Management module to point to an invalid memory location.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need the capability to influence or control the pointer provided by the SM module to trigger the vulnerability. This might require a deeper understanding of the interaction between baseband software and the SM module.

**Affected Products:**

The vulnerability affects a wide range of Samsung Exynos processors and modems, including:

*   Exynos 9820
*   Exynos 9825
*   Exynos 980
*   Exynos 990
