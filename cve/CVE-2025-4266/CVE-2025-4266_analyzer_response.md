# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-4266

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship identified is that CWE-89 stands alone as the root cause. No parent or child relationships significantly influence this specific identification, as the provided information directly points to SQL Injection.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is straightforward:
1.  The application fails to properly neutralize special elements in SQL commands.
2.  An attacker manipulates input parameters ('fromdate'/'tomdate').
3.  The injected SQL code is executed, leading to potential data breaches or unauthorized access.

The root cause is the **improper neutralization**, leading directly to the SQL Injection vulnerability.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly states that the manipulation of the 'fromdate' and 'tomdate' arguments leads to **sql injection** in PHPGurukul Notice Board System 1.0.

The primary evidence is: "The manipulation of the argument fromdate/tomdate leads to **sql injection**."

The Retriever Results strongly support CWE-89 as the primary candidate, with a score of 1.0. This, combined with the direct statement of SQL injection in the description, provides very high confidence in this assessment.

The analysis is based almost entirely on the provided evidence and the retriever results, making the selection of CWE-89 straightforward. It is at the optimal level of specificity (Base).

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g. "eval").

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.
