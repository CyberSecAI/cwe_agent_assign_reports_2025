It provides significantly more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nThe XSS could be used against high privilege users such as admins.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nAn attacker can craft a malicious HTML payload and trick an administrator into opening a specially crafted link. The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates this with a POST request to `admin-ajax.php` containing a malicious `searchData` parameter.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious HTML payload.\n*   The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a link containing the payload.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content states \"No known fix\" as of May 9, 2025.  The underlying mitigation would involve proper sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input before it is outputted in the page.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Affected Plugin:** Gearside Developer Dashboard <= 1.0.72\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.1 (High)\n*   **Researcher:** Tommaso Gregori (p1s1o)\n*   **WPVDB ID:** a487f5c9-7db6-4427-8d95-17acbfd49fd2\n*   **CWE:** CWE-79\n*   **OWASP Top 10:** A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
