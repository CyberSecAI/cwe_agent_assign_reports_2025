  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-2065 Content\n\nThis content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it's not directly tied to a CVE with the ID CVE-2025-2065 as the CVE description is a placeholder. It details a SQL injection vulnerability in \"Projectworlds Life Insurance Management System in PHP Project V1.0\".  It provides more detail than a standard CVE description.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   Insufficient user input validation of the `agent_id` parameter in the `/editAgent.php?agent_id=1` file.  Malicious code injected into this parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering\n*   Comprehensive system control\n*   Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The `/editAgent.php?agent_id=1` endpoint is vulnerable.  No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to craft and send malicious SQL queries via the `agent_id` parameter. No authentication is required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.\n*   **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.\n*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the least necessary privileges.\n*   **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.\n\n**Payload Example:**\n\n```\nParameter: agent_id (GET)\n    Type: time-based blind\n    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)\n    Payload: agent_id=1' AND (SELECT 6942 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))LrYO) AND 'QMEV'='QMEV\n```\n\n**Software Details:**\n\n*   **Affected Product:** Life Insurance Management System in PHP\n*   **Vendor Homepage:** <https://projectworlds.in/free-projects/php-projects/online-examination/>\n*   **Vulnerable File:** `/editAgent.php?agent_id=1`\n*   **Version:** V1.0\n*   **Software Link:** <https://projectworlds.in/life-insurance-management-system-in-php/>",

The root cause is **improper neutralization** leading to **SQL Injection**. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary identified weakness is CWE-89, which is a Base level CWE. There are no direct parent-child or chain relationships that significantly impact the selection in this case, as the vulnerability is a straightforward SQL injection. The abstraction level of CWE-89 is appropriate as it directly describes the **improper neutralization** leading to SQL injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is simple:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper neutralization** of special elements in SQL commands (CWE-89).\n2.  **Impact:** SQL Injection leading to unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and service interruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which strongly points to an SQL injection vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions that the manipulation of the `agent_id` argument leads to **SQL injection**. The CVE reference content summary confirms this by stating that the root cause is insufficient user input validation of the `agent_id` parameter, leading to malicious code being directly used in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.\n\nThe retriever results also support this finding, with CWE-89 being the top-ranked CWE. Given the direct evidence and the retriever results, CWE-89 is the most appropriate and specific CWE for this vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly describes the weakness.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
