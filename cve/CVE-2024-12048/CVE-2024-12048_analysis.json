  "description": "An **IDOR** (**Insecure Direct Object Reference**) vulnerability exists in transformeroptimus/superagi version v0.0.14. The application fails to properly check authorization for multiple API endpoints, allowing attackers to view, edit, and delete other users information without proper authorization. Affected endpoints include but are not limited to /get/project/{project_id}, /get/schedule_data/{agent_id}, /delete/{agent_id}, /get/organisation/{organisation_id}, and /get/user/{user_id}.",

This is further refined by the secondary CWE-425, which represents direct requests without adequate authorization enforcement. CWE-862, a class-level weakness denoting missing authorization, also contributes to the overall vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe862 -->|ParentOf| cwe425\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe425,cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)**, leading to the **missing authorization** checks which causes **attackers** to **view, edit, and delete other users information**.\n\nCWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) -> CWE-425 (Direct Request) -> Impact (View/Edit/Delete other users' data).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly states an **IDOR** vulnerability due to the application failing to properly check authorization. The primary weakness, CWE-639, directly addresses the **authorization bypass** by modifying the key value identifying the data. The description includes endpoints that are vulnerable and an impact of attackers viewing, editing, and deleting other user's information.\n\nThe retriever results and keyphrase analysis both point to CWE-639, CWE-425, and CWE-862 as relevant. CWE-639 is chosen as the primary because it directly reflects the **root cause** of the **IDOR**, where attackers can manipulate keys to access unauthorized data. The other CWEs refine the authorization context, where direct requests bypass checks.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-639 is a base-level weakness that accurately represents the core issue, while CWE-425 and CWE-862 provide additional context regarding the nature of the authorization failure.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   **CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key** - The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data. This aligns directly with the **IDOR** vulnerability.\n*   **CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')** - The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files. This supports the fact that the authorization checks are not being properly enforced for the listed API endpoints.\n*   **CWE-862: Missing Authorization** - The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. This CWE is a class level and could be considered, but is less specific than CWE-639 and CWE-425.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n*   CWE-285, CWE-863 are considered as alternatives. They are not selected as they are less descriptive of the actual vulnerability than CWE-639, CWE-425, and CWE-862. They are higher-level classes that describe authorization issues.",
