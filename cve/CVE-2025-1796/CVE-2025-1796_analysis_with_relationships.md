|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-338 | Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-338, which is a Base level CWE that directly addresses the use of a cryptographically weak PRNG. CWE-340, a Class level CWE, is a parent of CWE-341, and represents the broader category of generating predictable numbers or identifiers. The vulnerability description clearly indicates the use of `random.randint`, a **weak PRNG**, which leads to predictable password reset codes, thus aligning with CWE-338. CWE-340 is considered as a secondary weakness because it generalizes the issue of predictability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a weak PRNG (CWE-338)**, which leads to the **generation of predictable password reset codes (CWE-340)**, ultimately allowing an attacker to **take over user accounts**.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is the **use of a weak PRNG** (CWE-338). The vulnerability description states, "The application uses `random.randint` for this purpose, which is not suitable for cryptographic use and can be cracked." This directly supports the selection of CWE-338. The secondary weakness (CWE-340) describes the broader issue of generating predictable values but is less specific than CWE-338. The choice of CWE-338 is at the optimal level of specificity as it accurately describes the root cause of the vulnerability. Other CWEs, like CWE-337 (Predictable Seed), are related, but the core issue isn't necessarily a predictable seed but the weakness of the PRNG itself, which makes it crackable.

**Description**:
The product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) in a security context, but the PRNG's algorithm is not cryptographically strong.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-335: Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) but does not correctly manage seeds.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-337: Predictable Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) is initialized from a predictable seed, such as the process ID or system time.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-340: Generation of Predictable Numbers or Identifiers
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a scheme that generates numbers or identifiers that are more predictable than required.

**Mapping Guidance**:

## CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an algorithm or scheme that produces insufficient entropy, leaving patterns or clusters of values that are more likely to occur than others.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-334: Small Space of Random Values
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The number of possible random values is smaller than needed by the product, making it more susceptible to brute force attacks.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
