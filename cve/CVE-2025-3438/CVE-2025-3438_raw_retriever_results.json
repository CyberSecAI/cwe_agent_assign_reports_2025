  "query": "The MStore API Create Native Android & iOS Apps On The Cloud plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to limited privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 4.17.4. This is due to a lack of restriction of role when registering. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to to register with the wcfm_vendor role, which is a Store Vendor role in the WCFM Marketplace Multivendor Marketplace for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress. The vulnerability can only be exploited if the WCFM Marketplace Multivendor Marketplace for WooCommerce plugin is installed and activated. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 4.17.3.",
