There are no direct parent-child or chain relationships that strongly influence the selection in this case. While some other CWEs like CWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity) were considered, CWE-1333 is the most specific and appropriate due to the vulnerability being directly related to regular expression complexity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe1333 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity (CWE-1333) due to an invalid regex being provided.\n2.  **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the vLLM server.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on strong evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary, both of which explicitly mention the crash being caused by an invalid regex, leading to a **Denial of Service (ReDoS)**. The retriever results also ranked CWE-1333 as the top candidate. This aligns with the Base level abstraction for root cause analysis.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1333 is based on the evidence: \"vLLM server to crash if an invalid regex was provided while using structured output\" and \"Root cause of vulnerability: The vLLM server crashes when an invalid regular expression (regex) is provided within structured output.\"\nThe graph relationships didn't influence the selection as much as the clear description of the vulnerability.\nCWE-1333 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause, which is the inefficient regular expression complexity. Other CWEs were considered (like CWE-407, Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity), but they were more general and less specific to the identified **weakness**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced
