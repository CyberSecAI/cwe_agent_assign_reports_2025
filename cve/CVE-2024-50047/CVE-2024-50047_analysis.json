Fix this by allocating a new AEAD TFM for async decryption, but keep the existing one for synchronous READ cases (similar to what is done in smb3_calc_signature()). Also remove the calls to aead_request_set_callback() and crypto_wait_req() since its always going to be a synchronous operation.",

  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability occurs in the Linux kernel's SMB client during asynchronous decryption of SMB messages. This happens because the same crypto transform (TFM) is used concurrently for both synchronous and asynchronous operations.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the concurrent use of a single TFM for both synchronous and asynchronous decryption, leading to a race condition.\n- **Impact of exploitation:**  Exploitation results in a slab-use-after-free, which crashes the system. The provided kernel log shows a KASAN report indicating a read of size 8 at a freed memory location, which is a strong indication of a UAF.\n- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves mounting a CIFS share with encryption enabled (seal option) and initiating a large read operation using a command like 'dd'. This triggers the asynchronous decryption code path where the UAF exists.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to mount an SMB share on a vulnerable client, control the server, and perform large read operations triggering the vulnerable code path.\n\nThe provided content gives detailed information about the vulnerability including the root cause, the kernel crash details, the attack vector and the fix.",
