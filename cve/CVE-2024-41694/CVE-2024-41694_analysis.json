This suggests that while CWE-200 is a general classification, the vulnerability could potentially be narrowed down to either CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information) or CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information) if more specific information were available.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe359,cwe497 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **rootcause**, where the application or system **does not adequately protect sensitive information from unauthorized access**. This leads directly to the **impact** of confidential data, financial records, proprietary data, and personal information being accessed and potentially disclosed to unauthorized parties.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis strongly points to CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) as the primary CWE, primarily because it is explicitly mentioned in the vulnerability description and the key phrases section. The **weakness** identified is \"CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\". The analysis also considered the Retriever results, which listed CWE-200 as the top combined result.\n\nThe Retriever results also suggested considering CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor) and CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere). These are more specific instances of information exposure and are children of CWE-200. However, without more specific details confirming the type of sensitive information exposed (personal vs. system), it's difficult to definitively classify the vulnerability under these more specific CWEs.\n\nWhile CWE-200 is generally discouraged due to its high-level nature, its explicit mention in the vulnerability description, combined with the lack of more granular information, justifies its selection as the primary CWE. The presence of keywords like \"personal information\", \"financial records\" and \"proprietary data\" suggest the potential for CWE-359 and CWE-497, but additional evidence is needed before these can be confirmed.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n*   **CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** - The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n*   **CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor** - The product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.\n*   **CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere** - The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.",
