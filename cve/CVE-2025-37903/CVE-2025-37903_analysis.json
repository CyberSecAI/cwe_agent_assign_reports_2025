  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/amd/display Fix **slab-use-after-free** in hdcp The HDCP code in amdgpu_dm_hdcp.c copies pointers to amdgpu_dm_connector objects without incrementing the kref reference counts. When using a USB-C dock, and the dock is unplugged, the corresponding amdgpu_dm_connector objects are freed, creating dangling pointers in the HDCP code.
