  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-1116 Content\n\nThis content **relates** to CVE-2025-1116. It provides significantly more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization when constructing SQL queries within the Dreamvention Live Ajax Search OpenCart module. Specifically, the module directly incorporates user-supplied input (`$this->request->get['keyword']`) into an SQL query without using prepared statements or escaping special characters.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is a classic SQL injection flaw.\n*   **Error-based SQL Injection:** The vulnerability can be exploited using error-based techniques, where database errors reveal information.\n*   **Blind SQL Injection:**  If error reporting is disabled, blind SQL injection techniques (e.g., time-based) can still be used.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Full Database Access:** An unauthenticated attacker can access all data stored in the database.\n*   **Credential Theft:**  The attacker can potentially exfiltrate admin session details and credentials.\n*   **PII and Payment Data Exposure:**  Any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and payment details stored in the database are vulnerable to theft.\n*   **Site Compromise:** Full database access can lead to complete site compromise.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **GET Parameter Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `keyword` GET parameter in the URL: `http://opencart.ddev.site/index.php?route=extension/live_search/module/live_search.searchresults&keyword=malicious_payload`\n*   **Error-based Exploitation:** Exploiting database errors to reveal information.\n*   **Blind SQL Injection:** Using time-based or other blind techniques when error reporting is disabled.\n*   **sqlmap:** The `sqlmap` tool can be used to automate the exploitation process.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **Unauthenticated:** No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the OpenCart instance.\n*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** Understanding of SQL syntax is helpful for crafting payloads.\n*   **Tooling (Optional):** Tools like `sqlmap` can simplify the exploitation process.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all user-supplied input used in SQL queries.\n*   **Escaping:** Use the database driver's escaping mechanism (e.g., `$this->db->escape()`) to sanitize input.\n*   **Prepared Statements:**  Ideally, use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.\n*   **Example from OpenCart:** The document references a secure coding example from OpenCart itself, demonstrating the use of both casting to numeric types and escaping input.\n\n**Vulnerable Code Snippets:**\n\nThe following code snippets are identified as vulnerable:\n\n*   `catalog/controller/extension/module/d_ajax_search.php#L83` - Where the keyword is retrieved from the request.\n*   `catalog/model/extension/module/d_ajax_search.php#L5` - Where the unsanitized keyword is directly used in the SQL query.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*   **Affected Version:** 1.0.6 (Free version tested, PRO version potentially vulnerable)\n*   **Tested with:** OpenCart 4.0.2.3\n*   **CVSS:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L 9.9 Critical\n*   **CWE/CAPEC:** CWE-89, CAPEC-66, CAPEC-7",

The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization when constructing SQL queries. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the decision is the direct match of the vulnerability description to the definition of CWE-89. Although several other CWEs were considered, none directly address the **SQL Injection** issue as precisely as CWE-89.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command** (CWE-89) due to lack of input validation and sanitization.\n2.  **Impact:** An attacker can manipulate SQL queries to access sensitive data, potentially leading to full database access, credential theft, and site compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identifies **SQL Injection** as the primary vulnerability. The evidence from the CVE reference link confirms this, highlighting the lack of input validation and sanitization as the root cause. The retriever results strongly support CWE-89 as the most relevant CWE.\n\nThe decision is based on the clear evidence of **SQL injection** due to the **improper neutralization of special elements** within SQL commands. The CVE reference details the vulnerable code snippets and the attack vector, which aligns perfectly with CWE-89. The selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity, representing the base-level weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
