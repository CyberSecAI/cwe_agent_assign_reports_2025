CWE-73, External Control of File Name or Path, is a broader category encompassing path traversal, but CWE-36 is more precise given the vulnerability description explicitly mentions absolute path traversal. There is a parent-child relationship between CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory) and CWE-36 as CWE-36 is a type of CWE-22.

This leads directly to **CWE-36, Absolute Path Traversal**, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files. The impact of this is potential remote code execution due to exposure of cleartext credentials.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary classification is CWE-36, Absolute Path Traversal. This is based on the vulnerability description explicitly stating \"**absolute path traversal**\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirming that the `getImageByPath` method takes a user-supplied path and directly uses it to read a file, without proper input validation.\n\nCWE-73, External Control of File Name or Path, was also considered because the vulnerability involves external control of the file path. However, since the description specifically mentions \"absolute path traversal\", CWE-36 is a more specific and accurate representation of the weakness and the first in the vulnerability chain.\n\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-22, Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') and CWE-23, Relative Path Traversal.
