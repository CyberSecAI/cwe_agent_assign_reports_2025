The specific mechanism of injection is not detailed.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\nThe primary weakness is the plugin\\'s failure to properly handle input, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary content into the website.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\nAn attacker could inject malicious content, potentially including:\\n*   Phishing pages designed to steal user credentials.\\n*   Arbitrary HTML or JavaScript, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\\n*   Malicious iframes or redirects.\\n*   Defacement of the website\\'s content.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\nThe attack vector involves injecting malicious content into the ARForms Form Builder plugin. The specifics of how the injection occurs (e.g., through a form field or a specific plugin feature) are not provided but it is likely through a form submission.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\nThe attacker does not need to be authenticated meaning the vulnerability can be exploited by any unauthenticated user.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n*   The vulnerability has a low severity and is unlikely to be exploited, according to the source.\\n*   The vulnerability is present in versions <= 1.7.1 of the ARForms Form Builder plugin.\\n*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.7.2 of the plugin.\\n*   The vulnerability is classified under OWASP Top 10 as A3: Injection.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds':
