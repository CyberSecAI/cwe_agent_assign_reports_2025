  "description": "OpenWebUI version 0.3.0 contains a vulnerability in the audio API endpoint `/audio/api/v1/transcriptions` that allows for arbitrary file upload. The application performs **insufficient validation** on the `file.content_type` and allows user-controlled filenames, leading to a path traversal vulnerability. This can be exploited by an authenticated user to overwrite critical files within the Docker container, potentially leading to remote code execution as the root user.",

CWE-22 describes the root cause of the path traversal vulnerability. CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) is related because the vulnerability involves uploading a file.

This directly aligns with CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')). The ability to upload arbitrary files is represented by CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type). CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a general weakness and is included as a secondary weakness because it is **insufficient validation** that leads to the Path Traversal.\n\nThe retriever results also support this assessment, with CWE-22 being the top result.

Since the description doesn't specify whether the path traversal is relative or absolute, CWE-22 is more appropriate.\n*   CWE-59 (Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')) is not applicable because the vulnerability description does not mention anything about links or shortcuts.\n*   CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is not the primary cause, as the vulnerability exists for authenticated users.\n*   CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) is too general and doesn't accurately capture the specifics of the path traversal vulnerability.\n*   CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) is not directly related to the vulnerability description.\n*   CWE-41 (Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence) is not applicable as there is no mention of path equivalence or special characters in file and directory names.",
