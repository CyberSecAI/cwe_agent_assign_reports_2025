# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-57075

## Vulnerability Description
A **prototype pollution** in the lib.Logger function of eazy-logger v4.0.1 allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via supplying a crafted payload.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **prototype pollution**
- **impact:** Denial of Service
- **vector:** supplying a crafted payload
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** eazy-logger
- **version:** v4.0.1
- **component:** lib.Logger function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input validation when handling user-supplied data within the `lib.Logger` function, specifically allowing modification of the `Object.prototype`.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Prototype Pollution

Impact of exploitation:
Denial of Service (DoS) at a minimum. Potential for other injection-based attacks if the polluted property propagates to sensitive Node.js APIs (e.g., exec, eval), potentially enabling arbitrary command execution.

Attack vectors:
Supplying a payload with an `Object.prototype` setter to the `lib.Logger` function.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
An attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `lib.Logger` function.

Mitigation or fix:
The advisory does not specify a fix, but suggests input validation to prevent modification of the `Object.prototype`.
