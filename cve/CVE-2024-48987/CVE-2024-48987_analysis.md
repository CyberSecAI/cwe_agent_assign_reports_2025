# Analysis for CVE-2024-48987

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-502 | Deserialization of Untrusted Data | 0.9 | Base | Primary CWE | Allowed |
| CWE-321 | Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key | 0.8 | Variant | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-502, which represents the core issue of deserializing untrusted data. A related weakness, CWE-321, involves the use of a hard-coded cryptographic key. While CWE-321 could be considered a prerequisite, it is not directly in a parent-child or chain relationship with CWE-502. The abstraction levels were considered, with CWE-502 at the Base level and CWE-321 at the Variant level, both of which are preferred.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **use of the `APP_KEY`** in cookie serialization, leading to the deserialization of untrusted data, and ultimately resulting in remote code execution.
  - **Root Cause:** The **insecure deserialization** of cookies because of the hardcoded `APP_KEY`.
  - **Weakness:** Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502)
  - **Impact:** Remote Code Execution

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The description clearly points to the exploitation of the `APP_KEY` in cookie serialization, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

The evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary supports this:
- The vulnerability stems from the potential exploitation of the `APP_KEY` within the Snipe-IT application, specifically how it was used with cookie serialization.
-  The application was vulnerable to a Remote Code Execution (RCE) attack if an attacker gained access to the `APP_KEY`, due to the ability to serialize cookies.

Based on this evidence, CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data) was selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability stems from **insecure deserialization** of cookies because of the hardcoded `APP_KEY`. CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) is included as a secondary CWE because the `APP_KEY` may be a **hardcoded key**. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity (Base and Variant, respectively).

The retriever results confirm the relevance of CWE-502, which had a high score. The graph relationships did not significantly influence the selection, as the primary focus was on identifying the root cause based on the vulnerability description.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
