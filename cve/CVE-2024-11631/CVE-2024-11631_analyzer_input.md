## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `expedit.php` file, specifically the `expcat` parameter, before it's used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly uses the unsanitized `expcat` parameter in SQL queries, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate and sanitize user input, specifically the `expcat` parameter, which is directly used in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:**  Attackers can retrieve sensitive information stored in the database.
- **Data Tampering:**  Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **Comprehensive System Control:** Attackers might gain control over the system through database manipulation.
- **Service Interruption:**  Attackers could potentially disrupt the system's services.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `expedit.php` file.
- **`expcat` Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `expcat`, which is included in the POST request body using `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the application.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `expcat` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection.
- A proof of concept (POC) is provided, demonstrating how to exploit this vulnerability by injecting a sleep command via the `expcat` parameter.
- The content also provides examples of SQLMap being used to exploit the vulnerability
- The vulnerable application is the "Tailoring Management System Project In PHP With Source Code" version 1.0
- The vulnerable file is `expedit.php`
