  "description": "After gaining access to the firmware of a charging station, a file at can be accessed to obtain default credentials that are the same across all Iocharger AC model EV chargers. This issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC models before firmware version 25010801. The issue is addressed by requiring a mandatory password change on first login, it is still recommended to change the password on older models. Likelihood Moderate The attacker will first have to abuse a **code execution or file inclusion vulnerability** (for example by using .sh) to gain access to the .json file, or obtain a firmware dump of the charging station or obtain the firmware via other channels. Impact Critical All chargers using Iocharger firmware for AC models started with the same initial password. For models with firmware version before 25010801 a password change was not mandatory. It is therefore very likely that this firmware password is still active on many chargers. These credentials could, once obtained, allow an attacker to log into many Iocharger charging station, and allow them to execute arbitrary commands via the System Custom page. CVSS clarification Any network interface serving the web ui is vulnerable (AVN) and there are not additional security measures to circumvent (ACL), nor does the attack require and existing preconditions (ATN). The attack is authenticated, and requires high privileges (PRH), there is no user interaction required (UIN). The attack leads to a compromised of the confidentialy of the super user credentials of the device (VCH/VIN/VAN), and can subsequently be used to full compromise and other devices (SCH/SIH/SAH). Becuase this is an EV charger handing significant power, there is a potential safety impact (SP). This attack can be automated (AUY).",

CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')) are considered as secondary CWEs, as they represent potential prerequisite steps or related weaknesses. CWE-798 is the root cause, while CWE-306 and CWE-22 are potential ways to access the system to exploit the hard-coded credentials.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe798\n    cwe22 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe798\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe798 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe22 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a potential **code execution or file inclusion vulnerability** (as mentioned in the description) which could be represented by CWE-22. This could then lead to the attacker accessing the file containing the **hard-coded credentials** (CWE-798). If the charging station lacks proper authentication (CWE-306), the attacker can then use these credentials to log in and execute arbitrary commands.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **use of hard-coded credentials** (CWE-798), which is the most direct cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description states that \"a file at can be accessed to obtain default credentials that are the same across all Iocharger AC model EV chargers.\" This clearly points to the presence of hard-coded credentials.\nThe likelihood of exploitation is increased by the potential absence of mandatory password changes on older models, but the root cause remains the presence of the hardcoded credentials.\nCWE-306 is considered because the description mentions that after obtaining the credentials, an attacker can \"log into many Iocharger charging station, and allow them to execute arbitrary commands via the System Custom page,\" implying a potential lack of proper authentication mechanisms, but that is a consequence of the Hardcoded Credentials.\nCWE-22 is considered because the attacker will first have to abuse a **code execution or file inclusion vulnerability** (for example by using .sh) to gain access to the .json file.\n\nThe selection of CWE-798 as the primary CWE is based on the direct evidence of **hard-coded credentials** being present. The other CWEs are secondary considerations based on potential exploitation paths or contributing factors.\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they directly address the identified weaknesses.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
