# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-23942

## Description

A local user may find a configuration file on the client workstation with unencrypted sensitive data. This allows an attacker to impersonate the device or prevent the device from accessing the cloud portal which leads to a DoS.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Weakness:** unencrypted configuration file
- **Impact:** ['access cloud portal', 'denial of service', 'DoS']
- **Attacker:** local user

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-311 | Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data | 0.9 | Class | Primary CWE | Discouraged: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). |
| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.7 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis

The primary relationship influencing the decision is that CWE-312 "Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information" is a child of CWE-311 "Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data". While CWE-312 is more specific, the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary both emphasize the **missing** encryption aspect. Thus, CWE-311 is chosen as the primary, even though it's a class-level CWE.

## Vulnerability Chain

The chain of events is as follows:
1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing encryption** of the configuration file.
2.  **Weakness:** Sensitive data is stored **unencrypted** in a configuration file.
3.  **Impact:** Local user can access the configuration file.
4.  **Impact:** Attacker can impersonate the device.
5.  **Impact:** Device is prevented from accessing cloud portal, leading to DoS.

## Summary of Analysis

The initial assessment considered both CWE-311 and CWE-312. The vulnerability description clearly states that the configuration file contains **unencrypted** sensitive data. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions "**Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data**" as the root cause. Despite CWE-312 being more specific (Base level), the **missing** aspect is more prominent in the description. Therefore, CWE-311 is chosen as the primary CWE due to the emphasis on the absence of encryption as the root cause. CWE-312 is added as a secondary candidate since the sensitive information is ultimately stored in cleartext. The evidence supports the choice of CWE-311 as the primary weakness.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).



## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75

## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
