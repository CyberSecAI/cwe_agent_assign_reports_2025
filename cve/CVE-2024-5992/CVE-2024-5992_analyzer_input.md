# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-5992

## Vulnerability Description
The Cliengo - Chatbot plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a **missing capability check** on the update_chatbot_token and update_chatbot_position functions in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.1.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **missing capability check**
- **impact:** unauthorized modification of data
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **product:** Cliengo - Chatbot plugin for WordPress
- **version:** all versions up to and including 3.0.1
- **component:** update_chatbot_token and update_chatbot_position functions

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a missing authorization check in the `update_chatbot_token` and `update_chatbot_position` functions of the Cliengo - Chatbot WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to verify user capabilities before allowing modifications to chatbot settings via the `update_chatbot_token` and `update_chatbot_position` functions. This allows unauthenticated users to access and modify these settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Chatbot Unavailability:** Attackers could potentially disable or render the chatbot unavailable by modifying its settings.
- **Other Changes:** Attackers can modify other chatbot settings, leading to unexpected or undesirable behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessible over the network, as it involves functions that handle HTTP requests.
- Attackers do not need to be logged in or have any privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- They don't need to have any specific privileges or credentials on the WordPress instance.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of the Cliengo - Chatbot plugin up to and including 3.0.2.
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on July 8, 2024.
- A patch is available in version 3.0.3, which includes proper capability checks to prevent unauthorized access.

The provided code snippets from the plugin's `class-cliengo-form.php` file confirm that the `update_chatbot_token`, `update_chatbot_position`, `update_session`, `wordpress_login` and `wp_registration` functions have nonce verification but lack capability checks within the functions themselves. This confirms the Wordfence description of the vulnerability in `update_chatbot_token` and `update_chatbot_position` functions.
