The description explicitly states that an **integer overflow** was addressed. Additionally, the vulnerability description mentions \"improved input validation,\" which suggests a secondary weakness related to **CWE-20** [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation]. However, **CWE-20** [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation] is a class-level CWE and is discouraged when more specific CWEs are available, but given the limited information, it serves as a reasonable secondary classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **integer overflow** (**CWE-190** [CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound]), which leads to memory corruption and, ultimately, to a remote attacker being able to leak memory.

The secondary CWE, **CWE-20** [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation], is included because the fix involved \"improved input validation,\" suggesting that the **lack of input validation** contributed to the **integer overflow**.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting potential chains of weaknesses.

For instance, **CWE-787** [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write] could be a potential consequence of the integer overflow, but the description doesn't explicitly state that an out-of-bounds write occurred, only that memory could be leaked.",
