*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a negative size parameter being passed to the `memmove` function within the `r_main_rasm2` function. This leads to a crash due to the `AddressSanitizer: negative-size-param` error. Specifically, the issue occurs when using the `rasm2 -i 6 -E` command.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A negative-size-param vulnerability, which can lead to a crash.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** The exploitation of the vulnerability results in a crash of the `rasm2` tool.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specific command-line input: `rasm2 -i 6 -E 'mov eax, 30'`.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the `rasm2` command with the specified arguments.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** The commit c6c772d addresses the issue. The fix involves adding checks for invalid lengths and skip values in `rasm_disasm` and `r_main_rasm2` functions within `libr/main/rasm2.c`.
