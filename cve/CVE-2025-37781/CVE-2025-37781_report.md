# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-37781

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved i2c cros-ec-tunnel defer probe if parent EC is not present When i2c-cros-ec-tunnel and the EC driver are built-in, the EC parent device will not be found, leading to **NULL pointer dereference**. That can also be reproduced by unbinding the controller driver and then loading i2c-cros-ec-tunnel module (or binding the device). [ 271.991245]

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** NULL pointer dereference
- **Product:** Linux kernel
- **Component:** i2c cros-ec-tunnel

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-476 | NULL Pointer Dereference | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of the vulnerability description to the definition of CWE-476. While other CWEs were considered, none provided as direct a match to the **NULL pointer dereference** described in the vulnerability. CWE-476 is a Base level CWE, representing a specific type of error, which is appropriate given the details in the description.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain consists of a missing check for the existence of the EC parent device, which leads to a **NULL pointer dereference**.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly states that the root cause is a **NULL pointer dereference** that occurs when the EC parent device is not present. This aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-476. The retriever results also list CWE-476 as the top candidate. The evidence provided is clear and directly supports the selection of CWE-476 as the primary weakness.
