  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved i2c cros-ec-tunnel defer probe if parent EC is not present When i2c-cros-ec-tunnel and the EC driver are built-in, the EC parent device will not be found, leading to NULL pointer dereference. That can also be reproduced by unbinding the controller driver and then loading i2c-cros-ec-tunnel module (or binding the device). [ 271.991245]",
