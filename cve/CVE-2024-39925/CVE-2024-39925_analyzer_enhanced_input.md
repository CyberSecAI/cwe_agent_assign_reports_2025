## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in Vaultwarden (formerly Bitwarden_RS) 1.30.3. It lacks an offboarding process for members who leave an organization. As a result, the shared organization key is not rotated when a member departs. Consequently, the departing member, whose access should be revoked, retains a copy of the organization key. Additionally, the application fails to adequately protect some encrypted data stored on the server. Consequently, an authenticated user could gain unauthorized access to encrypted data of any organization, even if the user is not a member of the targeted organization. However, the user would need to know the corresponding organizationId. Hence, if a user (whose access to an organization has been revoked) already possesses the organization key, that user could use the key to decrypt the leaked data.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **lacking offboarding process**
- **impact:** access to encrypted data and gain unauthorized access and view unprotected data
- **attacker:** authenticated user
- **product:** Vaultwarden
- **version:** 1.30.3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-39925:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of organization key rotation in Vaultwarden. When a user's access to an organization is revoked, the organization's symmetric encryption key is not updated. This allows a former member who retains a copy of the organization key to potentially access the organization's data even after their access is revoked. Additionally, the application does not properly protect encrypted user data, allowing an authenticated user to gain unauthorized access to encrypted data of any organization, even if they are not a member.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Organization Key Rotation:** The core issue is that when a user is removed from an organization, the organization's encryption key is not rotated, allowing former members to potentially decrypt the organization's data.
*  **Insufficient Access Control:** Authenticated users can access the encrypted data of organizations they are not members of, violating expected access control restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Former organization members can decrypt and access all of the organization's data, including new secrets added after their access revocation. This includes secrets, notes, and other sensitive information.
*   **Data Breach:**  The vulnerability could lead to significant data breaches as former members can access sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Obtain Organization Key:** An attacker gains membership to an organization to obtain the organization key.
2.  **Revoke Access:** The attacker's access to the organization is revoked.
3.  **Exploit Data Access:** The attacker leverages the lack of key rotation to still use the previously obtained key. They exploit the vulnerability where they can request and obtain the encrypted organization data, even after access revocation.
4.  **Data Decryption:**  The attacker uses the valid, but old, organization key to decrypt and access all organization data, including new secrets created after their removal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Initial Membership:** The attacker must have been a member of the targeted organization at some point to obtain the organization's encryption key.
*   **Retained Key:** The attacker must retain a copy of the organization's key.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Vaultwarden instance to exploit the unauthorized data access.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the Vaultwarden server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The mgm security partners report provides a detailed description of the steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including screenshots of HTTP requests and responses.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Vaultwarden version 1.32.0.
*   The report mentions that an attacker could tamper with exchanged traffic to trick the Bitwarden client into decrypting the data.
