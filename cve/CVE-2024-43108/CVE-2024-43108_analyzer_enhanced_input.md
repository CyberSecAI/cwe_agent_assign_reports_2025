## Vulnerability Description
The goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin uses AES CTR type encryption for short, encrypted messages without any additional integrity checking mechanisms. This leaves messages malleable to an attacker that can access the message. It is advised to continue to use encryption in the plugin and update to the current release for enhanced encryption protocols.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **lack of message integrity checking**
- **impact:** integrity and malleable encrypted messages
- **attacker:** attacker with access to message
- **product:** goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin uses AES CTR encryption for short, encrypted messages without any integrity checking mechanisms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing Support for Integrity Check (CWE-353). The lack of integrity checks makes the messages malleable.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with access to the messages can modify them, compromising data integrity.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with adjacent access to the vulnerable device and the ability to intercept and modify messages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify messages within the goTenna network and have the ability to perform adjacent network attacks. Additionally, the attacker must have knowledge of the encryption mechanism (AES CTR).
