The vulnerability can cause the application to crash.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- A crafted WebAssembly (wasm) file.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted wasm file as input to the vulnerable `wace` component. This suggests a remote attack vector.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n- The vulnerability was found in commit `385e13c` of the `kanaka/wac` repository.\n- The vulnerability is tracked in issue #20 of the repository.\n- The discoverer is Ziyi Guo.",

The analysis focuses on identifying the specific location of the overflow (heap) to provide a more precise classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n\n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe787\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe120,cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward: A heap buffer overflow occurs due to an unspecified root cause, leading to a denial of service. The primary CWE identifies the specific type of buffer overflow.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description indicating a **heap overflow** in wac commit 385e1. The **heap overflow** is the root cause of the denial of service.\n\nThe evidence is strong, as the vulnerability description explicitly states \"heap overflow\".\n\nCWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow is chosen because it precisely matches the description of the vulnerability. It is a variant-level CWE, providing a specific classification.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound - While integer overflows can sometimes lead to buffer overflows, there's no evidence of that in this case. The description specifically mentions \"heap overflow,\" making CWE-122 a more direct and accurate match.\n*   CWE-193: Off-by-one Error - This is a specific type of error that could lead to a buffer overflow, but there's no evidence to support this specific cause.\n*   CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types - Similar to integer overflows, there's no direct evidence linking incorrect numeric conversions to the heap overflow.\n*   CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read - This is a different type of memory access issue and doesn't match the \"heap overflow\" description.\n*   CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write - This is a more general case of CWE-122, but CWE-122 is more specific.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-194: Unexpected Sign Extension\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an operation on a number that causes it to be sign extended when it is transformed into a larger data type.
