# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-47582

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-47582

## Description

Due to **missing validation of XML input**, an unauthenticated attacker could send malicious input to an endpoint which leads to XML Entity Expansion attack. This causes limited impact on availability of the application.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** missing validation of XML input
- **Weakness:** XML entity expansion
- **Impact:** limited impact on availability
- **Attacker:** unauthenticated attacker

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-776 | Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion') | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-112 | Missing XML Validation | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship identified is that **CWE-776 (XML Entity Expansion)** is often a consequence of **CWE-112 (Missing XML Validation)**. The **missing validation** allows the **expansion** to occur, creating a chain. Both are at the Base level of abstraction, which is ideal. There is no specific child weakness of **CWE-776** that is relevant, so we stay at the base level.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-112 (Missing XML Validation)**. Because the XML input is not validated, it leads to **CWE-776 (XML Entity Expansion)**, which causes a denial-of-service due to resource exhaustion. The **missing validation** is the root cause, and the **entity expansion** is the direct consequence.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description explicitly states "**missing validation of XML input**" as a root cause, which directly suggests **CWE-112 (Missing XML Validation)**. The description also mentions that this leads to "**XML entity expansion attack**", which maps directly to **CWE-776 (Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion'))**. The retriever results also support these findings, with **CWE-776** and **CWE-611 (Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference)** having the highest scores. While **CWE-611** is similar, the description specifically says "entity expansion," making **CWE-776** a better fit. **CWE-112** is also present in the retriever results. Both **CWE-776** and **CWE-112** are at the Base level of abstraction.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.81
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-776: Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses XML documents and allows their structure to be defined with a Document Type Definition (DTD), but it does not properly control the number of recursive definitions of entities.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-112: Missing XML Validation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product accepts XML from an untrusted source but does not validate the XML against the proper schema.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

### Detailed Explanation for CWE-776

*   **How the vulnerability's details match the CWE's characteristics:** The vulnerability description states that an attacker can cause "**XML entity expansion attack**". **CWE-776 (Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion'))** describes a scenario where the product does not properly control the number of recursive definitions of entities in XML documents, which leads to the **XML entity expansion attack** mentioned.
*   **The security implications and potential impact:** The security implication is a denial-of-service due to resource exhaustion. The "**limited impact on availability**" in the vulnerability description confirms this.
*   **Any parent-child relationships or chain patterns that influenced your mapping:** **CWE-776** is often a consequence of **CWE-112**.
*   **Whether the weakness is primary or secondary in the vulnerability:** Primary, as it is the direct result of the **missing validation**.
*   **How the official MITRE mapping guidance influenced your decision:** The MITRE mapping guidance allows the use of this CWE, as it is at the Base level of abstraction.

### Detailed Explanation for CWE-112

*   **How the vulnerability's details match the CWE's characteristics:** The vulnerability description states "**missing validation of XML input**". **CWE-112 (Missing XML Validation)** describes a scenario where the product accepts XML from an untrusted source but does not validate it against the proper schema.
*   **The security implications and potential impact:** The security implication is that the lack of validation allows malicious XML to be processed, leading to further vulnerabilities like **XML entity expansion**.
*   **Any parent-child relationships or chain patterns that influenced your mapping:** **CWE-112** can precede **CWE-776**.
*   **Whether the weakness is primary or secondary in the vulnerability:** Secondary, as it is the root cause that enables the primary weakness (**CWE-776**).
*   **How the official MITRE mapping guidance influenced your decision:** The MITRE mapping guidance allows the use of this CWE, as it is at the Base level of abstraction.

### CWEs Considered But Not Used:

*   **CWE-611 (Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference):** While similar to **CWE-776**, the vulnerability description specifically mentions "**XML entity expansion attack**", which is more directly related to recursive entity references rather than external entities.
*   **CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation):** This is a very general CWE, and **CWE-112** is a more specific case of **missing XML validation**.
*   **CWE-835 (Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')):** This is related to infinite loops, which might be a consequence of entity expansion in some cases, but it is not the direct cause or primary weakness described in the vulnerability.
*   **CWE-643 (Improper Neutralization of Data within XPath Expressions ('XPath Injection')):** This is related to XPath injection, which is a different kind of XML vulnerability.
*   **CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path):** This is related to file path manipulation and is not relevant to the described XML entity expansion vulnerability.
