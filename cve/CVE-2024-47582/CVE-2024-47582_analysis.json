The **missing validation** allows the **expansion** to occur, creating a chain. Both are at the Base level of abstraction, which is ideal. There is no specific child weakness of **CWE-776** that is relevant, so we stay at the base level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe776[\"CWE-776: Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')\"]\n    cwe112[\"CWE-112: Missing XML Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe776 <--|CANFOLLOW| cwe112\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe776 primary\n    class cwe112 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-112 (Missing XML Validation)**. Because the XML input is not validated, it leads to **CWE-776 (XML Entity Expansion)**, which causes a denial-of-service due to resource exhaustion. The **missing validation** is the root cause, and the **entity expansion** is the direct consequence.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states \"**missing validation of XML input**\" as a root cause, which directly suggests **CWE-112 (Missing XML Validation)**. The description also mentions that this leads to \"**XML entity expansion attack**\", which maps directly to **CWE-776 (Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion'))**. The retriever results also support these findings, with **CWE-776** and **CWE-611 (Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference)** having the highest scores. While **CWE-611** is similar, the description specifically says \"entity expansion,\" making **CWE-776** a better fit. **CWE-112** is also present in the retriever results. Both **CWE-776** and **CWE-112** are at the Base level of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-776: Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses XML documents and allows their structure to be defined with a Document Type Definition (DTD), but it does not properly control the number of recursive definitions of entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-112: Missing XML Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accepts XML from an untrusted source but does not validate the XML against the proper schema.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Detailed Explanation for CWE-776\n\n*   **How the vulnerability's details match the CWE's characteristics:** The vulnerability description states that an attacker can cause \"**XML entity expansion attack**\". **CWE-776 (Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion'))** describes a scenario where the product does not properly control the number of recursive definitions of entities in XML documents, which leads to the **XML entity expansion attack** mentioned.\n*   **The security implications and potential impact:** The security implication is a denial-of-service due to resource exhaustion.
