  "description": "The ProfileGrid - User Profiles, Groups and Communities plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 5.8.9. This is due to a **lack of validation on user-supplied data** in the pm_upload_image AJAX action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update their user capabilities to Administrator.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of validation on user-supplied data within the `pm_upload_image` AJAX action in the ProfileGrid plugin.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Improper Privilege Management:** The core issue is the failure to properly validate and sanitize user-supplied data, allowing for unauthorized modification of user capabilities.\n*   **Authorization Bypass:** Authenticated users, even with minimal privileges like \"Subscriber,\" can bypass intended authorization checks.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can elevate their user role to \"Administrator,\" granting them complete control over the WordPress site. This includes the ability to add, modify, or delete content, install plugins/themes, and even compromise the underlying server.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **AJAX Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted AJAX request to the `pm_upload_image` action.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Authenticated User:** Attackers need to have a valid user account on the WordPress site, with at least \"Subscriber\" level permissions.\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the affected WordPress site.\n\n**Technical Details**\nThe vulnerability exists in the `profilegrid-user-profiles-groups-and-communities` plugin for WordPress, specifically in the handling of AJAX requests related to image uploads (`pm_upload_image` action). The plugin fails to validate user-supplied data associated with this action, which allows an attacker with subscriber-level permissions to manipulate their user capabilities and gain administrative access.\n\nThe provided code snippets from `profile-magic-admin-power.js`, `coverimg_crop.php`, and `crop.php` illustrate the AJAX calls and the subsequent handling of data, highlighting the lack of proper validation.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 5.8.9.\n*   The fix is available in version 5.9.0 and later.\n*   The Wordfence article and the linked Trac commits provide additional context and details on the vulnerability and its fix.",

This means that the system assigned the wrong privileges based on **incorrectly validated data**. The secondary weakness is **Incorrect Authorization** (CWE-863) because the system incorrectly performs the authorization check.\nThe abstraction level of CWE-266 (Base) is preferred because it is more specific than CWE-269 (Class) or CWE-284 (Pillar).
