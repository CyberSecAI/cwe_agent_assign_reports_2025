# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2024-13893

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1392 | Use of Default Credentials | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The root cause is the use of the same credentials for all devices. |
| CWE-798 | Use of Hard-coded Credentials | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate: The default credentials may be hard-coded. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is the **use of default credentials (CWE-1392)**. This is a Base level CWE. A related CWE is **CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials)**, which is a parent of **CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password)** and **CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key)**. **CWE-1392** is a peer of **CWE-798**. The relationships show that the credentials could be either default or hardcoded, with hardcoded being more specific.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **use of default credentials (CWE-1392)**. The attacker gains physical access to the device and retrieves the password hash. The attacker then uses these default credentials to access the telnet service.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability is caused by the Smartwares cameras using the same credentials for the telnet service. The root cause is the **use of default credentials (CWE-1392)**. The content from `cert.pl_2d13a217_20250624_174319.html` states: "Affected devices share the same credentials for the telnet service" and "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Use of Default Credentials (CWE-1392)".
The retriever results show that **CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password)** and **CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials)** are also possible matches. While the credentials could be hardcoded, the description and reference summary explicitly mention that the devices share the same credentials, making **CWE-1392** the most appropriate choice.
**CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials)** is considered as a secondary candidate because the default credentials might also be hard-coded. The selection is based on the evidence provided and the mapping guidance for each CWE. **CWE-1392** is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.
Other CWEs considered but not selected:

*   **CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password)**: While this is a variant of **CWE-798**, the vulnerability description and reference summary explicitly state that the devices share the same credentials, implying a default credential rather than a specifically hard-coded password.
*   **CWE-287 (Improper Authentication)**: This is a class-level CWE and is too general. The more specific **CWE-1392** is more appropriate.
*   **CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information)**: This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability does not involve cleartext transmission of sensitive information.
*   **CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function)**: This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability does not involve missing authentication for a critical function.
*   **CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password)**: This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability does not involve plaintext storage of a password.
*   **CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key)**: This is not applicable as no cryptographic key is involved.
