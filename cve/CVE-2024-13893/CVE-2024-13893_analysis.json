  "description": "Smartwares cameras CIP-37210AT and C724IP, as well as others which share the same firmware in versions up to 3.3.0, might share same credentials for telnet service. Hash of the password can be retrieved through physical access to SPI connected memory. For the telnet service to be enabled, the inserted SD card needs to have a folder with a specific name created. Two products were tested, but since the vendor has not replied to reports, patching status remains unknown, as well as groups of devices and firmware ranges in which the same password is shared. Newer firmware versions might be vulnerable as well.",

This is a Base level CWE. A related CWE is **CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials)**, which is a parent of **CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password)** and **CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key)**. **CWE-1392** is a peer of **CWE-798**.

The attacker gains physical access to the device and retrieves the password hash. The attacker then uses these default credentials to access the telnet service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is caused by the Smartwares cameras using the same credentials for the telnet service. The root cause is the **use of default credentials (CWE-1392)**. The content from `cert.pl_2d13a217_20250624_174319.html` states: \"Affected devices share the same credentials for the telnet service\" and \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Use of Default Credentials (CWE-1392)\".\nThe retriever results show that **CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password)** and **CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials)** are also possible matches. While the credentials could be hardcoded, the description and reference summary explicitly mention that the devices share the same credentials, making **CWE-1392** the most appropriate choice.\n**CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials)** is considered as a secondary candidate because the default credentials might also be hard-coded. The selection is based on the evidence provided and the mapping guidance for each CWE. **CWE-1392** is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.\nOther CWEs considered but not selected:\n\n*   **CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password)**: While this is a variant of **CWE-798**, the vulnerability description and reference summary explicitly state that the devices share the same credentials, implying a default credential rather than a specifically hard-coded password.\n*   **CWE-287 (Improper Authentication)**: This is a class-level CWE and is too general. The more specific **CWE-1392** is more appropriate.\n*   **CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information)**: This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability does not involve cleartext transmission of sensitive information.\n*   **CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function)**: This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability does not involve missing authentication for a critical function.\n*   **CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password)**: This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability does not involve plaintext storage of a password.\n*   **CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key)**: This is not applicable as no cryptographic key is involved.",
