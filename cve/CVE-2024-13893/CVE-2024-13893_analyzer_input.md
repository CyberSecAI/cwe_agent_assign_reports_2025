# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-13893

## Vulnerability Description
Smartwares cameras CIP-37210AT and C724IP, as well as others which share the same firmware in versions up to 3.3.0, might share same credentials for telnet service. Hash of the password can be retrieved through physical access to SPI connected memory. For the telnet service to be enabled, the inserted SD card needs to have a folder with a specific name created. Two products were tested, but since the vendor has not replied to reports, patching status remains unknown, as well as groups of devices and firmware ranges in which the same password is shared. Newer firmware versions might be vulnerable as well.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** telnet service
- **product:** Smartwares cameras CIP-37210AT, C724IP
- **version:** up to 3.3.0
