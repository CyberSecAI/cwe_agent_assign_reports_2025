# Vulnerability Description

    The SCSS Happy Compiler - Compile SCSS to CSS & Automatic Enqueue plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Stored Cross-Site Scripting** due to a **missing capability check** and **insufficient sanitization** on the import_settings() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.10. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject malicious web scripts.
