  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from a **Broken Access Control (Improper Access Control)** in the SourceCodester Online Railway Reservation System.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Inadequate access controls:** The application fails to properly restrict access to the `/orrs/admin/inquiries/view_details.php` endpoint, allowing unauthorized users to view inquiry details.\n*   **Direct object reference:** The application uses the `id` parameter in the URL to directly access inquiry details without proper authorization checks.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized information disclosure:** Attackers can access sensitive inquiry data submitted by users, which could potentially include personal information or other confidential details.\n*   **Loss of confidentiality:** This could lead to a breach of privacy for the users of the system.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Direct URL manipulation:** An attacker can directly access the vulnerable endpoint (`/orrs/admin/inquiries/view_details.php`) by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the application.\n*   **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need to be logged into the system to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The provided GitHub link includes a Python script that demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability by iterating through different ID values. This provides a clear exploitation path.\n*   The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the SourceCodester Online Railway Reservation System.\n*   The vulnerability was submitted and accepted on vuldb.com",

CWE-639 is a related CWE where authorization bypass occurs through manipulating a user-controlled key. While both CWEs are relevant, CWE-284 serves as the broader, more direct classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe284 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    cwe639 -->|PEEROF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper access control** (CWE-284). An attacker can then manipulate the `id` parameter to bypass authorization (CWE-639), leading to unauthorized information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is **improper access control**, specifically CWE-284. This is supported by the vulnerability description stating, \"The manipulation of the argument id leads to **improper access controls**.\" The content summary further reinforces this by highlighting inadequate access controls and direct object reference. CWE-639 is a related CWE that describes authorization bypass through user-controlled keys, and is a related secondary weakness.
