  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2025-27775', description='Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.7 and prior are vulnerable to **server-side request forgery** (SSRF) and **file write** in `model_download.py` (line 143 in 3.2.7). The **blind SSRF** allows for sending requests on behalf of Applio server and can be leveraged to probe for other vulnerabilities on the server itself or on other back-end systems on the internal network, that the Applio server can reach. The **file write** allows for writing files on the server, which can be coupled with other vulnerabilities, for example an unsafe **deserialization**, to achieve remote code execution on the Applio server. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.', key_phrases={'rootcause': '', 'weakness': ['server-side request forgery', 'deserialization', 'blind SSRF', 'file write'], 'impact': [\"'write files on the server']\", \"'remote code execution'\", \"['file write'\"], 'vector': '', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'Applio', 'version': '3.2.7 and prior', 'component': 'model_download.py'}, reference_content='## Analysis of CVE-2025-27775 based on provided content\\n\\nThe provided content details 13 vulnerabilities (GHSL-2024-341 to GHSL-2024-353) found in Applio version 3.2.7, and maps them to CVEs including CVE-2025-27775.  Here\\'s a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2025-27775, extracted from the text:\\n\\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-27775\\n**GHSL ID:** GHSL-2024-342\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\nThe vulnerability stems from the use of user-supplied URLs in `download.py` and `routes.py` which are then used to make HTTP GET requests in `model_download.py` on line 156.  Specifically, the code handles URLs containing \"/blob/\" or \"/resolve/\".\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n* Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\\n* File Write\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n* Blind server-side request forgery, allowing probing of internal systems.\\n* Potential for arbitrary file write on the server.\\n* Combined with other vulnerabilities (like unsafe deserialization), could lead to remote code execution.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n* Providing a malicious URL to the application through the affected endpoints.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n* Ability to control the URL provided to the application.\\n\\n**Mitigation or fix:**\\nThe document does not specify a mitigation or fix. It only details the vulnerabilities and their impact.\\n\\n**Additional Details:**\\nThe report mentions the use of a CodeQL SSRF query to help identify the vulnerability.\\n\\nThis content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, outlining the specific files and lines of code involved, and the potential consequences of exploitation.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution':

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.7 and prior are vulnerable to **server-side request forgery** (SSRF) and **file write** in `model_download.py` (line 143 in 3.2.7). The **blind SSRF** allows for sending requests on behalf of Applio server and can be leveraged to probe for other vulnerabilities on the server itself or on other back-end systems on the internal network, that the Applio server can reach. The **file write** allows for writing files on the server, which can be coupled with other vulnerabilities, for example an unsafe **deserialization**, to achieve remote code execution on the Applio server. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## WEAKNESS: 'server-side request forgery'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1. CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (Score: 757.11)\n\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination....\n\n### 2.
