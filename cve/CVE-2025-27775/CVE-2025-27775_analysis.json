  "description": "Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.7 and prior are vulnerable to **server-side request forgery** (SSRF) and **file write** in `model_download.py` (line 143 in 3.2.7). The **blind SSRF** allows for sending requests on behalf of Applio server and can be leveraged to probe for other vulnerabilities on the server itself or on other back-end systems on the internal network, that the Applio server can reach. The **file write** allows for writing files on the server, which can be coupled with other vulnerabilities, for example an unsafe **deserialization**, to achieve remote code execution on the Applio server. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.",

This can lead to the application making requests to unintended locations, potentially exposing internal resources or performing actions on behalf of the server. **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation** is added as a secondary weakness, because user-supplied input (URLs) are not validated. **CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data** is present because the file write combined with unsafe deserialization can lead to remote code execution, and the application is deserializing untrusted data. **CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** is present because the file write operation in `model_download.py` can allow writing files to arbitrary locations.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    \n    cwe918 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe20\n    cwe918 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe502\n    cwe918 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe22\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe918 primary\n    class cwe20,cwe502, cwe22 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**, where the application makes requests to external resources based on user-supplied input. This is possible because of **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**. The **file write** vulnerability, potentially linked to **CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**, allows writing files on the server. Combining this with an unsafe **deserialization**, which is **CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data**, leads to remote code execution.\n  - **CWE-918** (Root Cause: SSRF) -> **CWE-20** (Improper Input Validation)\n  - **CWE-918** (Root Cause: SSRF) -> **CWE-22** (Path Traversal)\n  - **CWE-22** (Path Traversal) -> **CWE-502** (Deserialization of Untrusted Data)\n  - **CWE-502** (Deserialization of Untrusted Data) -> Remote Code Execution (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary **weakness** is clearly **CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**, as the description explicitly mentions \"blind SSRF\" and its potential to probe for other vulnerabilities. This is supported by the high relevance score in the keyphrase analysis. The secondary **weakness** is **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**, because this is the mechanism that allows **CWE-918** to occur. Additionally, the description mentions a **file write** that can be combined with unsafe **deserialization** to achieve remote code execution, therefore **CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data** and **CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** are secondary weaknesses. All selected CWEs are at the base level of abstraction, providing a detailed representation of the vulnerability.\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and keyphrase analysis. The graph relationships highlight how the weaknesses are interconnected, with **CWE-918** being the entry point and **CWE-20**, **CWE-22**, and **CWE-502** contributing to the overall vulnerability.\n\nThe decision to select these CWEs is justified by the specific details in the vulnerability description, the high relevance scores, and the hierarchical relationships between CWEs. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, accurately representing the nature of the **weaknesses** and their potential impact.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability doesn't involve incorrect implementation of an authentication algorithm.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected*: While data authenticity might be a concern, the primary issue is the lack of validation on the request itself, making **CWE-918** a better fit.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*Not Selected*: While injection might be a consequence, the root cause is the lack of validation on the URL, which is better captured by **CWE-918**.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.

It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n*Not Selected*: **CWE-668** is too broad and doesn't accurately reflect the specific vulnerability. **CWE-918** provides a more precise classification.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: While the application relies on untrusted input (the URL), the",
