# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-34344

## Vulnerability Description
Nuxt is a free and open-source framework to create full-stack web applications and websites with Vue.js. Due to the insufficient validation of the `path` parameter in the NuxtTestComponentWrapper, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript on the server side, which allows them to execute arbitrary commands. Users who open a malicious web page in the browser while running the test locally are affected by this vulnerability, which results in the remote code execution from the malicious web page. Since web pages can send requests to arbitrary addresses, a malicious web page can repeatedly try to exploit this vulnerability, which then triggers the exploit when the test server starts.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient validation of the path parameter**
- **impact:** execute arbitrary JavaScript and execute arbitrary commands and remote code execution
- **vector:** malicious web page
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** NuxtTestComponentWrapper

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Insufficient validation of the `path` parameter in the `NuxtTestComponentWrapper`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   The lack of proper input validation on the `path` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript.
*   This results in remote code execution (RCE) on the server side.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Remote code execution on the server running the test environment.
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when a user running the Nuxt test server locally opens a malicious webpage in their browser.
*   The malicious webpage can send requests to the test server, exploiting the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to host or control a malicious web page.
*   The victim must be running the Nuxt test server locally.
*   The victim must open the malicious web page in their browser while the test server is running.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Nuxt versions `3.4.0` and later but less than `3.12.4`.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version `3.12.4` and later.
*   The CVSS score is 8.8, indicating a high severity.
*   The attack vector is network-based, requires low complexity, no privileges, user interaction, no scope change, high confidentiality, high integrity and high availability impact.
*   The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2024-34344.
*   The vulnerability was reported by `@Ry0taK`.
