However, the secondary CWE, CWE-212 [Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer], is a base CWE. There is no direct parent-child relationship between CWE-525 and CWE-212. The relationship between them is that CWE-212 is the **root cause** of **why** CWE-525 is happening.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe525[\"CWE-525: Use of Web Browser Cache Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n    \n    cwe525 -- FLOWS_FROM --> cwe212\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe525 primary\n    class cwe212 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper** handling of caches (identified by the provided fix), leading to the **exposure** of deleted notes via the hot corner feature.\n\nCWE-212 [Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer] -> CWE-525 [Use of Web Browser Cache Containing Sensitive Information]\n\nThe root cause is CWE-212, the impact is CWE-525.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the most relevant CWE appeared to be CWE-525 [Use of Web Browser Cache Containing Sensitive Information], given the explicit mention of \"caches\" in the vulnerability description and the fix. The vulnerability states: \"Hot corner may unexpectedly reveal a users deleted notes\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also mentions: \"* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Hot corner unexpectedly revealing a user\u2019s deleted notes.\".\n\nHowever, I also considered the underlying **root cause**. The fix involves \"improved handling of caches,\" which suggests sensitive information wasn't properly removed or handled before being stored in the cache. This points towards CWE-212 [Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer]. CWE-212 explains that \"The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\"\nUltimately, I selected CWE-525 as the primary weakness because it directly describes the vulnerability, where sensitive information is exposed via the cache. I included CWE-212 as a secondary weakness to represent the underlying root cause of the problem.\n\nThe abstraction levels are appropriate, with CWE-525 being a Variant and CWE-212 being a Base. The selection is based on matching the weakness to the vulnerability's behavior and the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
