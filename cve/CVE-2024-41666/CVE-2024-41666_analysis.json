  "description": "Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD has a Web-based terminal that allows users to get a shell inside a running pod, just as they would with kubectl exec. Starting in version 2.6.0, when the administrator enables this function and grants permission to the user `p, rolemyrole, exec, create, */*, allow`, even if the user revokes this permission, the user can still perform operations in the container, as long as the user keeps the terminal view open for a long time. Although the token expiration and revocation of the user are fixed, however, the fix does not address the situation of revocation of only user `p, rolemyrole, exec, create, */*, allow` permissions, which may still lead to the leakage of sensitive information. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.11.7, 2.10.16, and 2.9.21.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-41666:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the Argo CD web terminal session not properly handling the revocation of user permissions. Specifically, after a user's `exec` permissions are revoked, the established WebSocket connection to the terminal remains active, allowing the user to continue executing commands inside the container.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Insufficient permission checks:**  The application only verifies RBAC permissions during the initial handshake of the WebSocket connection. It fails to validate permissions on subsequent messages sent through the same connection.\n- **Lack of real-time permission enforcement:**  Permissions are not re-evaluated during the lifespan of the terminal session, which means revocation of permissions is not effective immediately.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized access:** A user whose `exec` permissions have been revoked can still access and execute commands inside the target container.\n- **Sensitive information disclosure:** The attacker can use the terminal to access and potentially leak sensitive information from the container.\n- **Compromise of the container:** Continued access could lead to further unauthorized activities, such as modifying data or disrupting services.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Web-based terminal:** The attack leverages the Argo CD's web-based terminal feature.\n- **WebSocket connection:** The vulnerability is exposed through the established WebSocket connection.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n1. **Initial permissions:** The attacker must initially be granted `exec` permissions to the target application in Argo CD.\n2. **Open terminal session:** The attacker needs to open and maintain an active terminal session before the administrator revokes the `exec` permission.\n3. **Argo CD access:** Requires access to the Argo CD UI.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\nThe fix involves verifying RBAC permissions not just during the handshake but on each message sent over the websocket. This is achieved by adding a `validatePermissions` function that checks the permissions before every `Read` operation on the websocket, and sends a permission denied message if the user lacks the necessary permissions, closing the connection.\n\nThe code changes are in the files `server/application/terminal.go`, `server/application/websocket.go`, and `server/application/websocket_test.go`. The key changes include:\n\n- Passing the RBAC enforcer and application name to the `newTerminalSession` function.\n- Implementing `validatePermissions` in `terminalSession` to enforce permissions on each read.\n-  Modifying `Read` function in `terminalSession` to call `validatePermissions` before reading messages from websocket.\n- Adding tests to verify RBAC enforcement.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The provided information includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) video demonstrating the vulnerability.\n- The vulnerability is rated as \"Moderate\" severity.\n- Patches are available in Argo CD versions 2.11.7, 2.10.16, and 2.9.21.\n- The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2023-40025, but it addresses the scenario where only the `exec` permissions are revoked.\n\nThis information is more detailed than a basic CVE description and provides a clear picture of the vulnerability and its fix.",

However, due to **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863) during the WebSocket connection lifecycle, the user retains access and can perform unauthorized operations. This leads to potential sensitive information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which is quite detailed. The vulnerability lies in the **insufficient permission checks** after the initial WebSocket handshake. Although the user's permissions are revoked, the existing terminal session does not re-validate these permissions, allowing continued access. This aligns well with CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), as the authorization check is present, but **incorrectly** implemented, failing to validate permissions on subsequent messages. The fix implements `validatePermissions` function to enforce permissions on each read, implying the previous implementation was flawed.\n\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization) was considered, but it's a more general case where authorization is either missing or improperly performed. In this case, there's an authorization check, but it's flawed, making CWE-863 a better fit.
