CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference (Score: 284.30)\n\nThe product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL....\n\n### 5. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 283.37)\n\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
