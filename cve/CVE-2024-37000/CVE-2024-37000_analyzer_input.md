    ## WEAKNESS: 'memory corruption'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write (Score: 325.49)

The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....

### 2. CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read (Score: 296.02)

The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....

### 3. CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 286.77)

A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc()....

### 4. CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference (Score: 284.30)

The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL....

### 5. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 283.37)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...
