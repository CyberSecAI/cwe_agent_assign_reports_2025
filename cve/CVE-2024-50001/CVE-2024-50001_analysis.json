  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net/mlx5 Fix error path in multi-packet WQE transmit Remove the **erroneous unmap in case no DMA mapping was established** The multi-packet WQE transmit code attempts to obtain a DMA mapping for the skb. This could fail, e.g. under memory pressure, when the IOMMU driver just cant allocate more memory for page tables. While the code tries to handle this in the path below the err_unmap label it erroneously unmaps one entry from the sqs FIFO list of active mappings. Since the current map attempt failed this unmap is removing some random DMA mapping that might still be required. If the PCI function now presents that IOVA, the IOMMU may assumes a rogue DMA access and e.g. on s390 puts the PCI function in error state. The erroneous behavior was seen in a stress-test environment that created memory pressure.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe root cause is an error in the multi-packet WQE transmit code within the Mellanox mlx5 driver. Specifically, when a DMA mapping for an skb fails (e.g., due to memory pressure), the error handling path incorrectly unmaps an entry from the Send Queue's (sq) FIFO list of active DMA mappings.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nThe vulnerability is a double-free like condition. The incorrect unmapping of a DMA mapping leads to a scenario where a valid DMA mapping can be prematurely removed, and the associated IOVA (I/O Virtual Address) can potentially be reused by another process, while the original PCI function might still be using it.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nIf the PCI function then attempts to use the original IOVA, the IOMMU might identify it as a rogue DMA access. On s390 systems, this leads to the PCI function being put into an error state. The system can become unstable or even crash in such a scenario.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe attack vector is indirect and triggered by memory pressure leading to DMA mapping failures during multi-packet WQE transmissions. This memory pressure can be a consequence of a user-level process consuming all available memory.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nAn attacker needs the ability to create memory pressure and trigger a DMA mapping failure during the execution of the multi-packet WQE transmit function, likely by utilizing network functionalities or by allocating large amounts of memory.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n* The provided commits address this issue by removing the erroneous unmap from the error handling path, preventing the premature removal of DMA mappings.\n* This vulnerability was found in a stress test environment simulating memory pressure.\n* The vulnerable code is in the `mlx5e_sq_xmit_mpwqe` function within `drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core/en_tx.c`.\n* The fix involves removing `mlx5e_dma_unmap_wqe_err(sq, 1);` line from the `err_unmap` label.\n* This vulnerability impacts systems using the Mellanox mlx5 driver for network interfaces with IOMMU enabled, especially in environments with high memory usage.",

CWE-401 is a variant of CWE-404, representing a more specific case where memory is the resource that is not released. The evidence points towards a resource not being released which fits CWE-404 and could fit CWE-401. Choosing CWE-404 as primary and CWE-401 as secondary reflects the core issue (improper resource shutdown) and the specific type of resource involved (memory).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe755[\"CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    \n    cwe401 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    cwe404 -->|CHILDOF| cwe755\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe404 primary\n    class cwe401 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a failed DMA mapping, which triggers an error path. The **erroneous unmap in case no DMA mapping was established** within this error path leads to the improper release of a DMA mapping, potentially causing a rogue DMA access and putting the PCI function in an error state.\n  - Root Cause: **erroneous unmap in case no DMA mapping was established**\n  - Weakness: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release (CWE-404) and Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime (CWE-401)\n  - Impact: PCI function in error state.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary focus is on identifying the root cause and the immediate weakness that results from it. The core issue is the **erroneous unmap in case no DMA mapping was established** which leads to an incorrect release of a resource. This aligns with CWE-404 (Improper Resource Shutdown or Release). The fact that it's specifically memory that's not released after its lifetime leads to the secondary consideration of CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime).\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description supports this assessment: \"While the code tries to handle this in the path below the err_unmap label it erroneously unmaps one entry from the sqs FIFO list of active mappings.\"\n\nThe graph relationships, especially the parent-child relationship between CWE-404 and CWE-401, guided the decision to include both CWEs, with CWE-404 as the primary due to its broader applicability and CWE-401 as a secondary CWE providing more specific context about the type of resource involved.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-404 is a Class, and while it has Base-level children, none of them precisely capture the act of erroneously unmapping a DMA entry. CWE-401, as a Variant of CWE-404, adds more specificity without being overly narrow.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs multiple related behaviors, but the behaviors are performed in the wrong order in ways which may produce resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
