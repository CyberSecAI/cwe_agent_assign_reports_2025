CWE-312 is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-922 (Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information) and CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data). CWE-200 is a class-level CWE that represents a general case of information exposure.

The impact is the **disclosure of sensitive information** (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description states that \"HCL DRYiCE AEX is potentially impacted by **disclosure of sensitive information** in the mobile application when a snapshot is taken.\" The key phrase is \"**disclosure of sensitive information**\".\n\nThe Retriever Results identify several candidate CWEs, including CWE-256, CWE-312, CWE-522, CWE-497, and CWE-200.\n\nCWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is the best fit because the vulnerability involves sensitive information being exposed when a snapshot is taken, which implies that the information is being stored in cleartext. This aligns with the description of CWE-312, which states that \"The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\"\n\nCWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a class-level CWE and is discouraged as a primary mapping. It is more of an impact than a root cause.\n\nCWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) is too specific as the vulnerability description doesn't mention passwords specifically.\n\nCWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) is similar to CWE-256, but it is at the Class level, so I did not chose this one.\n\nCWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere) is also a possible candidate, but CWE-312 is a better fit since the information is stored in cleartext.\n\nThe evidence is weak because there is no CVE Reference Links Content Summary to indicate the root cause. The vulnerability description is also quite vague. However, the wording suggests that the sensitive information is stored in a way that allows it to be captured in a snapshot.\n\nI selected CWE-312 because it is the most specific and accurate representation of the **root cause** based on the provided information, even though that information is limited.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product's intended functionality exposes information to certain actors in accordance with the developer's security policy, but this information is regarded as sensitive according to the intended security policies of other stakeholders such as the product's administrator, users, or others whose information is being processed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
