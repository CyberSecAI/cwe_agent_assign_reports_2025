BoringSSLAEADContext keeps track of how many OHTTP responses have been sent and uses this sequence number to calculate the appropriate nonce to use with the encryption algorithm. Unfortunately, two separate errors combine which would allow an attacker to cause the sequence number to **overflow** and thus the nonce to repeat.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36121:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a combination of two issues in the `BoringSSLAEADContext` class within the Netty incubator codec-ohttp library:\n1. **Lack of Overflow Detection:** The code does not check for or enforce a maximum sequence number, which is crucial as per the HPKE RFC 9180, Section 5.2.\n2. **32-bit Integer for Sequence Number:** The sequence number (seq) used to calculate the nonce is stored as a 32-bit integer, making it relatively easy to overflow.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Integer Overflow (CWE-190):** The 32-bit integer used to track the sequence number can overflow, leading to nonce reuse.\n- **Insufficient Randomness (CWE-323):** The nonce generation mechanism relies on an incrementing sequence number, which, when it overflows, causes the same nonce to be generated again.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Confidentiality Compromise:**  Reusing nonces with AES-GCM undermines the confidentiality of the encrypted data because the same keystream will be used for multiple encryption operations.\n- **Integrity Compromise:** Reusing nonces with AES-GCM also weakens integrity, as it makes it possible to modify the ciphertext such that it produces a different valid plaintext.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network:** The attack can occur remotely over a network connection. The attacker needs to induce the server to encrypt enough data to trigger the nonce reuse, so a large number of requests to an OHTTP server may be required.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges.\n- **User Interaction Required:** The user (victim) has to interact with the vulnerable system. The interaction would consist of sending or receiving encrypted messages using the affected Netty library.\n- **High Attack Complexity:**  Exploitation requires the attacker to send more than 2^32 messages that the vulnerable server needs to encrypt using the same key. This is likely to require a large number of requests and responses and precise control over the state and parameters of the communication.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- The vulnerability is present in `netty-incubator-codec-ohttp` versions 0.0.3.Final to 0.0.10.Final.\n- It is fixed in version 0.0.11.Final.\n- The CVSS v3 score is 5.9, classified as \"Moderate\".\n- The CVSS vector string is `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N`",

This leads to **CWE-323 Reusing a Nonce, Key Pair in Encryption**, which is a consequence of the overflow. The relationship is that the integer overflow **CAN PRECEDE** the nonce reuse.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe323[\"CWE-323: Reusing a Nonce, Key Pair in Encryption\"]\n\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe323\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe323 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of** overflow protection for the 32-bit integer sequence number (**CWE-190**), which leads to the sequence number wrapping around to previously used values. This then results in the reuse of nonces (**CWE-323**), compromising the encryption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference.\n\n*   The vulnerability description highlights an **overflow** in the sequence number, which directly corresponds to **CWE-190**. The CVE reference confirms this by stating: \"The 32-bit integer used to track the sequence number can **overflow**, leading to nonce reuse.\"\n*   The consequence of the **overflow** is nonce reuse, which is accurately captured by **CWE-323**. The CVE reference states: \"Reusing nonces with AES-GCM undermines the confidentiality of the encrypted data because the same keystream will be used for multiple encryption operations.\"\n*   The relationship between **CWE-190** and **CWE-323** is clear: the **overflow** is the root cause, and nonce reuse is the resulting vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. **CWE-190** accurately describes the integer overflow, and **CWE-323** precisely captures the nonce reuse issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
