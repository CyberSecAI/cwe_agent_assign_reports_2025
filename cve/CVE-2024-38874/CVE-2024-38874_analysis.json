This **missing** authorization allows unauthenticated users to directly access and manipulate event data via **CWE-639 [Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key]** or **CWE-425 [Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')]**, leading to the impact of activating or deleting events.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary root cause of this vulnerability is **CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]**. The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**Missing access checks in the management plugin**.\" This directly aligns with **CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]**, which describes a scenario where a product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. The impact, \"activate or delete various events for unauthenticated users,\" further supports this classification. The retriever results also highly suggest **CWE-639 [Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key]** due to the \"**insecure direct object reference**\" (IDOR) vulnerability. **CWE-425 [Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')]** is also a possible candidate because of the **missing** authorization allowing unauthenticated users to directly access and manipulate event data. **CWE-284 [Improper Access Control]** is a more general case of authorization issues so could be applicable.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially

Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe

Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level
