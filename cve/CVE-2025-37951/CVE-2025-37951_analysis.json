  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/v3d Add job to pending list if the reset was skipped When a CL/CSD job times out, we check if the GPU has made any progress since the last timeout. If so, instead of resetting the hardware, we skip the reset and let the timer get rearmed. This gives long-running jobs a chance to complete. However, when `timedout_job()` is called, the job in question is removed from the pending list, which means it wont be automatically freed through `free_job()`. Consequently, when we skip the reset and keep the job running, the job wont be freed when it finally completes. This situation leads to a **memory leak**, as exposed in [1] and [2]. Similarly to commit 704d3d60fec4 (drm/etnaviv dont block scheduler when GPU is still active), this patch ensures the job is put back on the pending list when extending the timeout.",

The vulnerability explicitly describes a **memory leak** caused by the failure to release memory.|\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-401, which is a variant. No other hierarchical or chain relationships influenced the decision because the provided text is very specific about a memory leak.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe401 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n\n1.  A job times out.\n2.  The system checks if the GPU has made progress.\n3.  If progress has been made, the reset is skipped.\n4.  The job is removed from the pending list and not automatically freed.\n5.  The job completes, but the memory is not released, leading to a **memory leak** (CWE-401).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based directly on the vulnerability description, which explicitly states that a **memory leak** occurs. The job is not freed, which directly corresponds to CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime).\n\nThe description explicitly mentions the **memory leak** when the reset is skipped, and the job isn't put back on the pending list for proper cleanup. This direct evidence makes CWE-401 the most appropriate and specific classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize a critical resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*   Not selected because the issue is not related to initialization, but rather to the release of memory.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*   Not selected as locking is not mentioned.\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*   Not selected as concurrency is not mentioned.\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*   Not selected as it concerns sensitive information, which is not relevant here.\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*   Not selected as the issue is not related to accessing an uninitialized pointer.\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
