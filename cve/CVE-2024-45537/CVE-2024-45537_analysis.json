  "description": "Apache Druid allows users with certain permissions to read data from other database systems using JDBC. This functionality allows trusted users to set up Druid lookups or run ingestion tasks. Druid also allows administrators to configure a list of allowed properties that users are able to provide for their JDBC connections. By default, this allowed properties list restricts users to TLS-related properties only. However, when configuration a MySQL JDBC connection, users can use a particularly-crafted JDBC connection string to provide properties that are not on this allow list. Users without the permission to configure JDBC connections are not able to exploit this vulnerability. CVE-2021-26919 describes a similar vulnerability which was partially addressed in Apache Druid 0.20.2. This issue is fixed in Apache Druid 30.0.1.",

CWE-610 is considered as a secondary candidate because the vulnerability involves using an externally controlled name to access a resource outside the intended control sphere. While CWE-610 is a class-level CWE and is generally discouraged, it represents a potential consequence of the primary weakness. The relationship between these CWEs is that CWE-807 can potentially lead to CWE-610 if the untrusted input allows access to external resources.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe807[\"CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\"]\n    cwe610[\"CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe807 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe610\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe807 primary\n    class cwe610 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **reliance on untrusted inputs** (CWE-807). A crafted JDBC connection string is used to provide properties not on the allow list. This leads to the **ability to read data from other database systems** (CWE-610, potentially).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered several potential CWEs, including those related to authorization and privilege management. However, the core issue lies in the fact that the system relies on an input (the JDBC connection string) that can be manipulated to bypass the intended security restrictions. The vulnerability description states, \"However, when configuration a MySQL JDBC connection, users can use a particularly-crafted JDBC connection string to provide properties that are not on this allow list.\" This strongly suggests that the system's security decision is based on an input that can be controlled by an untrusted actor, which aligns with CWE-807. The fact that this leads to reading data from other database systems can be viewed as an instance of CWE-610, but CWE-807 better captures the root cause. I am overriding the retriever results because the description emphasizes a crafted input bypassing restrictions. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the **reliance on untrusted inputs** and its potential consequence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
