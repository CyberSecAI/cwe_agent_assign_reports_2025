This is classified as a Broken Access Control issue (OWASP A1).\n- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can view sensitive information that should not be available to regular users. This could be used to exploit other vulnerabilities within the system.\n- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.",

CWE-497 is a more specific Base-level CWE that describes the exposure of sensitive system information.

However, it could be a valid secondary CWE if the exposed information is system-related.\n\nCWE-425 Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') was also considered as the plugin does not adequately enforce authorization.\n\nThe final decision to use CWE-200 as primary is based on the direct statement about **exposure of sensitive information** and the fact that the impact is exactly that. While CWE-200 is discouraged, the evidence points to it directly.
