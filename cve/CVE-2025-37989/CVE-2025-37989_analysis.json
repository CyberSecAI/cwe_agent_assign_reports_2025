  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net phy leds fix **memory leak** A network restart test on a router led to an out-of-memory condition, which was traced to a **memory leak** in the PHY LED trigger code. The root cause is **misuse of the devm API**. The registration function (phy_led_triggers_register) is called from phy_attach_direct, not phy_probe, and the unregister function (phy_led_triggers_unregister) is called from phy_detach, not phy_remove. This means the register and unregister functions can be called multiple times for the same PHY device, but devm-allocated memory is not freed until the driver is unbound. This also prevents kmemleak from detecting the leak, as the devm API internally stores the allocated pointer. Fix this by replacing devm_kzalloc/devm_kcalloc with standard kzalloc/kcalloc, and add the corresponding kfree calls in the unregister path.",

The `devm` API allocates memory that is tied to the driver's lifecycle, but in this case, the registration and unregistration functions are called multiple times without corresponding memory releases. This results in memory being leaked over time, eventually leading to an out-of-memory condition.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime). This is because the core issue is that allocated memory is not being released when it is no longer needed, which directly matches the definition of CWE-401.\n\nThe evidence for this is present in the Vulnerability Description: \"A network restart test on a router led to an out-of-memory condition, which was traced to a **memory leak** in the PHY LED trigger code\" and \"This means the register and unregister functions can be called multiple times for the same PHY device, but devm-allocated memory is not freed until the driver is unbound.\"\n\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-401 as the top candidate with a score of 1.0.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-665 (Improper Initialization) - While initialization is related to resource management, the core issue isn't about incorrect initialization, but about failing to release allocated memory.\n*   CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) - This isn't about a lack of limits on resource allocation, but rather the failure to release allocated resources, regardless of the size.\n*   CWE-415 (Double Free) - The vulnerability description doesn't indicate a double free, but a failure to free.\n*   CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) - The vulnerability description doesn't mention anything about excessive size.\n*   CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) - The vulnerability description doesn't indicate a null pointer dereference.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize a critical resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
