# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-52926

## Vulnerability Description
Delinea Privilege Manager before 12.0.2 mishandles the security of the Windows agent.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **product:** Delinea Privilege Manager
- **version:** before 12.0.2
- **component:** Windows agent

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided document contains release notes for Delinea Privilege Manager, and mentions a security issue in older Windows agent versions.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The document mentions a security issue with Windows agent versions 12.0.2142 and older. The specific nature of the issue isn't detailed, but it is related to how elevation is performed which caused a regression. This resulted in Visual Studio Code and other applications which create child processes to malfunction if they were elevated via policy.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A security vulnerability that affects how elevation is performed in older agent versions.
- The vulnerability causes a regression that can impact applications that create child processes when elevated through policy.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Applications like Visual Studio Code, which rely on creating child processes, may malfunction if elevated using a vulnerable version of the agent.
- The document states that older agent versions can render the system unusable if installed on Windows 11 version 24H2 or Windows Server 2025. Symptoms of the incompatibility include UAC failing to elevate programs that require admin rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is related to the Privilege Manager Windows agent itself, and how it handles elevation requests. An attacker would likely need to exploit the flawed elevation process.
- It's implied that simply running an affected application with the vulnerable agent installed will trigger the issue.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to have a vulnerable version of the Privilege Manager Windows agent installed on a machine where they want to cause the malfunction, along with the ability to trigger program elevation.
- It appears no direct control of the vulnerable application is required, simply elevation via policy.

**Additional notes:**
- The document provides a fix in agent version 12.0.2150 to resolve the security vulnerability.
- Version 12.0.2153 corrects the regression caused by the fix in 12.0.2150.
- There is an incompatibility issue of older agent versions with Windows 11 24H2 or Windows Server 2025 which will render the system unusable.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
