CWE-770 is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-400, specifying that the resource consumption involves allocation without limits. CWE-95 is a Variant-level CWE, specifying code injection via dynamic evaluation. These relationships help refine the classification from a general resource consumption issue to a more specific scenario involving uncontrolled allocation and code injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe95[\"CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe95 -->|RELATED| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe95 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of ast.literal_eval** without proper input validation. This leads to the ability to inject code, potentially causing excessive resource consumption and ultimately leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n`Improper Input -> Code Injection -> Resource Consumption -> DoS`\n\nCWE-95 represents the code injection aspect, while CWE-400 represents the resulting resource consumption that causes the DoS.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is caused by the **use of ast.literal_eval** on untrusted input, leading to a Denial of Service. The primary CWE is CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) because the vulnerability ultimately results in excessive consumption of resources, crashing the server. The use of `ast.literal_eval` without validation allows for potentially malicious input to be processed, which can lead to resource exhaustion.\n\nCWE-95 (Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')) is considered because `ast.literal_eval` dynamically evaluates the input, and the lack of proper neutralization allows for potentially harmful code to be executed. This is a secondary weakness, as it's the mechanism that enables the resource consumption.\n\nCWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is also considered as a secondary weakness because the evaluated code can potentially allocate excessive resources, contributing to the Denial of Service.\n\nThe retriever results suggested other CWEs such as CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity), CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion), CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input), CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value), and CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation). These were not selected because they do not directly represent the root cause and the specific mechanism of the vulnerability as accurately as CWE-400, CWE-95 and CWE-770. CWE-20 is too broad and discouraged, while the others are more specific scenarios that don't fully capture the overall issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed -
