# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2024-10188

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-95 | Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection') | 0.7 | Variant | Secondary | Allowed |
| CWE-770 | Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-400, a Class-level CWE that indicates the broad category of resource consumption issues. CWE-770 is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-400, specifying that the resource consumption involves allocation without limits. CWE-95 is a Variant-level CWE, specifying code injection via dynamic evaluation. These relationships help refine the classification from a general resource consumption issue to a more specific scenario involving uncontrolled allocation and code injection.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **use of ast.literal_eval** without proper input validation. This leads to the ability to inject code, potentially causing excessive resource consumption and ultimately leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).

`Improper Input -> Code Injection -> Resource Consumption -> DoS`

CWE-95 represents the code injection aspect, while CWE-400 represents the resulting resource consumption that causes the DoS.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability is caused by the **use of ast.literal_eval** on untrusted input, leading to a Denial of Service. The primary CWE is CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) because the vulnerability ultimately results in excessive consumption of resources, crashing the server. The use of `ast.literal_eval` without validation allows for potentially malicious input to be processed, which can lead to resource exhaustion.

CWE-95 (Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')) is considered because `ast.literal_eval` dynamically evaluates the input, and the lack of proper neutralization allows for potentially harmful code to be executed. This is a secondary weakness, as it's the mechanism that enables the resource consumption.

CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is also considered as a secondary weakness because the evaluated code can potentially allocate excessive resources, contributing to the Denial of Service.

The retriever results suggested other CWEs such as CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity), CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion), CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input), CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value), and CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation). These were not selected because they do not directly represent the root cause and the specific mechanism of the vulnerability as accurately as CWE-400, CWE-95 and CWE-770. CWE-20 is too broad and discouraged, while the others are more specific scenarios that don't fully capture the overall issue.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.65
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.65
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.64
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.64
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.64
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g. "eval").

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.64
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.64
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.64
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.63
