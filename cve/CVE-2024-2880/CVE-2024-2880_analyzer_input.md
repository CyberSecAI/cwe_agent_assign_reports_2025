# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-2880

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 16.5 prior to 16.11.6, starting from 17.0 prior to 17.0.4, and starting from 17.1 prior to 17.1.2 in which a user with `admin_group_member` custom role permission could ban group members.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** ban group members
- **attacker:** user with admin_group_member custom role
- **product:** GitLab CE/EE
- **version:** 16.5 to 16.11.6, 17.0 to 17.0.4, 17.1 to 17.1.2

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing permission check on the backend request that handles user banning in GitLab groups. While the UI correctly restricts the ability to ban users to group owners, a `Guest` user with a custom role having the "Admin group member" permission can bypass this restriction by directly sending a crafted backend request.

* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Inadequate Authorization:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks on the backend when handling ban user requests. The system fails to verify that the user initiating the ban action has the necessary owner-level privileges.
    *   **Role Permission Bypass**: Although the UI prevents the user from performing the action, the API does not check for the required owner permissions, thus enabling a role permission bypass.
    *   **Inconsistent permission enforcement:** The UI enforces the correct permission while the backend does not.

* **Impact of Exploitation:** A `Guest` user with the "Admin group member" custom role can ban any user within the group, including users with higher permissions (such as Maintainer), causing disruption and potentially hindering group operations.

* **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector involves crafting a direct HTTP POST request to the `/groups/<group_path>/-/group_members/<user_id>/ban` endpoint.
    *   The attacker needs to obtain a valid `Cookie` and `authenticity_token` or `X-Csrf-Token` to authenticate the request and bypass CSRF protection.
    *   The attacker must know the target user's ID, which can be obtained from the HTML source of the group members page.

* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be a `Guest` user with a custom role that has the `Admin group member` permission within the target group.
    *   The attacker needs access to a web browser or tool that can send HTTP requests, and to view the page source to extract user ids and tokens.
    *   The attacker does not need any special network access beyond what is required to access the GitLab instance.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set ‚Äì Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* üîç *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* üîç *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion ‚Äì CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### üî∏ CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúA user created with the ‚Äòguest‚Äô role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúThe backup service runs as root but only needs read access.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### üî∏ CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúUser can access another user‚Äôs invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.‚Äù*

## Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *‚ÄúUser can escalate privileges to admin.‚Äù*
> ‚ùå Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged ‚Äì only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ‚úÖ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**
