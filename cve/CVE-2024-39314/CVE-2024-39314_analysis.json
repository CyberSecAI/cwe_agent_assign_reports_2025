  "description": "toy-blog is a headless content management system implementation. Starting in version 0.4.3 and prior to version 0.5.0, the **administrative password was leaked** through the command line parameter. The problem was patched in version 0.5.0. As a workaround, pass `--read-bearer-token-from-stdin` to the launch arguments and feed the token from the standard input in version 0.4.14 or later. Earlier versions do not have this workaround.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-39314:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe administrative token (bearer token) was being passed as a command-line parameter. This exposed the token to local users who could potentially view the command-line arguments through process listings or shell history.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information (CWE-214):** Passing the administrative token as a command-line argument made it visible to local users.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker could gain access to the administrative token, allowing them to potentially modify or delete blog content, depending on the functionality associated with the token.\n*  **Integrity Breach:** By obtaining the administrative token, the attacker can modify or delete the blog content, leading to a loss of integrity.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by users who have local access to the system running the vulnerable application.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker must have local access to the system where the application is running.\n*   The attacker needs the ability to view command-line parameters (e.g., through process lists or command history).\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The fix for this issue involved removing the `--bearer-token` command-line parameter and reading the token from standard input. This is documented in the provided commit details (4d003e4) which removes the command-line option for the bearer token.\n*   The advisory also mentions a temporary workaround for versions 0.4.14 and later which was the use of the `--read-bearer-token-from-stdin` flag, and then providing the token through standard in.\n* The advisory states that versions prior to 0.4.14 do not have a workaround.\n\nThis information aligns with the description of CWE-214 (Credentials Management Errors) and provides specific context regarding how the vulnerability is triggered and exploited.",

The **administrative password was leaked** through the command line parameter. |\n| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The administrative token (bearer token) was being passed as a command-line parameter. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-214, which represents the **invocation of a process using visible sensitive information**. CWE-201 is a secondary CWE because the sensitive information (the administrative password) was inserted into data that was sent (in this case, the command-line arguments). CWE-214 is a child of CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere), reflecting that the vulnerability exposes system-level information. CWE-201 can precede CWE-226 (Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse) or CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer), indicating that the exposed data might later be stored or transferred insecurely.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe214[\"CWE-214: Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe214 -->|CHILDOF| cwe497\n    cwe201 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe214\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe214 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n    class cwe497 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **leakage of the administrative password** by passing it as a command-line parameter (CWE-214). This leads to the **insertion of sensitive information into sent data** (CWE-201) because the password becomes visible in the command-line arguments. The exposure can then lead to a confidentiality breach.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description stating the **administrative password was leaked** through the command line parameter, and the CVE reference links content summary, which identifies the root cause as passing the administrative token as a command-line parameter, thus exposing it to local users.\nThe primary CWE, CWE-214, is the most specific and relevant because it accurately describes how the sensitive information was exposed. CWE-201 is included as a secondary CWE to further clarify that the sensitive information was included in data that was sent (the command-line arguments).\nOther CWEs like CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) were considered but not selected because they describe authorization and authentication issues, which are consequences of the vulnerability being exploited, but do not accurately describe the root cause of the **password** being **leaked** via command line.\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they provide a clear and accurate description of the vulnerability based on the evidence provided.",
