## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
This content relates to CVE-2025-0751 as it details two heap-buffer-overflow vulnerabilities found in the mp42aac component of Bento4. It provides more detail than a standard CVE description would.

Here's the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   **Bug 1:** Heap-buffer-overflow in `AP4_BitReader::ReadBits(unsigned int)`
*   **Bug 2:** Heap-buffer-overflow in `fread` called from `AP4_StdcFileByteStream::ReadPartial`

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Heap-buffer-overflow

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   The ASan output indicates a heap-buffer-overflow, which could lead to crashes or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Processing specially crafted MP4 files (demonstrated with `seeds/input1` and `seeds/input2`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious MP4 file as input to a system using Bento4's mp42aac component.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   No mitigation or fix is provided in this content. It is a vulnerability report.

**Additional Details:**

*   The report includes AddressSanitizer (ASan) output, which pinpoints the location of the overflows.
*   The report provides crash inputs (`seeds/input1` and `seeds/input2`) for reproducing the issues.
*   The report includes validation steps to reproduce the issue.
*   The report details the environment where the vulnerability was found (Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS, Bento4 v1.6.0).
*   The report credits the finders: Teng Zhang, Mingxuan Liu, Chengsiyuan Yang, Heng Zhang, Hao Liu, Yaoliang Zhang, Dawei Guo, Hang Liu from NPU Unmanned Systems Safety Laboratory.
