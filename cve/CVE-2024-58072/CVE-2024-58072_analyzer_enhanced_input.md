# Vulnerability Description

    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi rtlwifi remove unused check_buddy_priv Commit 2461c7d60f9f (rtlwifi Update header file) introduced a global list of private data structures. Later on, commit 26634c4b1868 (rtlwifi Modify existing bits to match vendor version 2013.02.07) started adding the private data to that list at probe time and added a hook, check_buddy_priv to find the private data from a similar device. However, that function was never used. Besides, though there is a lock for that list, it is never used. And when the probe fails, the private data is never removed from the list. This would cause a second probe to access freed memory. Remove the unused hook, structures and members, which will prevent the potential **race condition** on the list and its corruption during a second probe when probe fails.

    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'race condition'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 711.73)

The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently....

### 2. CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data (Score: 698.55)

The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors....

### 4. CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition (Score: 667.49)

The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state....
