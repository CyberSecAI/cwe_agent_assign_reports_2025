Later on, commit 26634c4b1868 (rtlwifi Modify existing bits to match vendor version 2013.02.07) started adding the private data to that list at probe time and added a hook, check_buddy_priv to find the private data from a similar device. However, that function was never used. Besides, though there is a lock for that list, it is never used. And when the probe fails, the private data is never removed from the list. This would cause a second probe to access freed memory. Remove the unused hook, structures and members, which will prevent the potential **race condition** on the list and its corruption during a second probe when probe fails.', key_phrases={'rootcause': ['unused check_buddy_priv function', 'race condition'], 'weakness': '', 'impact': 'access freed memory', 'vector': '', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'Linux kernel', 'version': '', 'component': 'rtlwifi'}, reference_content='UNRELATED\\n\\nAll provided content describes Anubis, a system designed to mitigate website scraping by AI companies.

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi rtlwifi remove unused check_buddy_priv Commit 2461c7d60f9f (rtlwifi Update header file) introduced a global list of private data structures. Later on, commit 26634c4b1868 (rtlwifi Modify existing bits to match vendor version 2013.02.07) started adding the private data to that list at probe time and added a hook, check_buddy_priv to find the private data from a similar device. However, that function was never used. Besides, though there is a lock for that list, it is never used. And when the probe fails, the private data is never removed from the list. This would cause a second probe to access freed memory. Remove the unused hook, structures and members, which will prevent the potential **race condition** on the list and its corruption during a second probe when probe fails.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'race condition'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 711.73)\n\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently....\n\n### 2.
