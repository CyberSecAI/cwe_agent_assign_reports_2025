## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in SourceCodester Phone Contact Manager System 1.0. This issue affects the function UserInterfaceMenuDisplayStart of the component User Menu. The manipulation of the argument name leads to **improper input validation**. Attacking locally is a requirement. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper input validation**
- **vector:** manipulation of argument name
- **product:** Phone Contact Manager System
- **version:** 1
- **component:** User Menu

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to CVE-2024-12353.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user input in the `UserInterface::MenuDisplayStart()` function. Specifically, when the user enters a mixed input string containing a number followed by non-numeric characters (e.g., "1qqqqq"), `std::cin >> choice` extracts the integer part ('1'), but leaves the remaining non-numeric characters ("qqqqq") in the input buffer. Subsequent calls to `getline(std::cin, name)` then consume these leftover characters, assigning them to the `name` variable which leads to data corruption

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer Pollution:** The primary issue is that the input buffer is not cleared after using `std::cin >> choice`, leading to residual characters being read by subsequent input operations.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code lacks proper input validation to ensure that user inputs conform to the expected format. This allows for non-numeric characters to be processed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Corruption:** The polluted input buffer leads to invalid data (e.g. "qqqqq") being written to files such as `Users.txt`, causing data corruption.
- **Logic Errors:** Invalid input processing can cause unintended program behavior, such as incorrect user authentication or unexpected program states.
- **Potential Security Risks**: The vulnerability could be exploited to inject malicious input (e.g. SQL injection payloads, path traversal sequences) into the program via the polluted input buffer, leading to security breaches

**Attack vectors:**
- **User Input:** The attack vector is through user-supplied input at the program's menu. An attacker could intentionally enter mixed input that pollutes the input buffer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to interact with the program's menu, as the vulnerability is exposed through the `UserInterface::MenuDisplayStart()` function.
- No specific privilege is required, since the vulnerability occurs due to how the program handles user-provided input.
