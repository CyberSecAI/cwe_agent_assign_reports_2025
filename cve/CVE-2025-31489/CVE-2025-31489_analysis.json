  "description": "MinIO is a High Performance Object Storage released under GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. The signature component of the authorization may be invalid, which would mean that as a client you can use any arbitrary secret to upload objects given the user already has prior WRITE permissions on the bucket. Prior knowledge of access-key, and bucket name this user might have access to - and an access-key with a WRITE permissions is necessary. However with relevant information in place, uploading random objects to buckets is trivial and easy via curl. This issue is fixed in RELEASE.2025-04-03T14-56-28Z.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-31489 based on provided content\n\nThe provided content is directly related to CVE-2025-31489. It details a security vulnerability in MinIO related to incomplete signature validation for unsigned trailer uploads. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe signature component of the authorization was not being validated for unsigned payload trailer uploads. This meant that an invalid signature was being ignored.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Incomplete signature validation.\n*   Allows arbitrary secret to be used for uploads with valid WRITE permissions.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAn attacker with prior knowledge of access keys and bucket names with WRITE permissions can upload arbitrary objects to buckets.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Exploitation via `curl` or similar tools.\n*   Requires knowledge of access key and bucket name with WRITE permissions.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Prior knowledge of access key and bucket name with WRITE permissions.\n*   Ability to craft and send HTTP requests (e.g., using `curl`).\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Patch:** The vulnerability was patched in RELEASE.2025-04-03T14-56-28Z (Pull Request #21103).\n*   **Workaround:** Reject requests with `x-amz-content-sha256: STREAMING-UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD-TRAILER` at the load balancer (LB) layer and advise users to use `STREAMING-AWS4-HMAC-SHA256-PAYLOAD-TRAILER`.\n\n**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The PR description explains the vulnerability in detail, including how the lack of signature validation allows an attacker to bypass security checks.\n*   The PR includes a test case (`TestUnsignedCVE`) to verify the fix.\n*   The PR was reviewed and approved by multiple contributors.\n*   The fix involves adding a parameter to control signature validation in the reader and updating request handlers and tests.\n*   The vulnerability was reported by owainkenwayucl and AndEsterson.\n*   The fix was implemented by harshavardhana.",

CWE-285 is a class-level CWE. CWE-347 describes the specific flaw of **improper verification of cryptographic signature**, which leads to the authorization bypass. Both are related to access control, but CWE-347 is more specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe347 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper verification of the cryptographic signature** (CWE-347). This leads to a bypass in authorization (CWE-285), which allows an attacker to upload arbitrary objects, given they already have write permissions on the bucket.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered both CWE-347 and CWE-285 based on the description that the \"signature component of the authorization may be invalid\" and the user \"can use any arbitrary secret to upload objects\". However, after careful analysis, CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature was chosen as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nThe evidence from the CVE description is: \"The signature component of the authorization may be invalid\". This indicates that the cryptographic signature verification process is flawed. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also supports this, stating \"The signature component of the authorization was not being validated for unsigned payload trailer uploads. This meant that an invalid signature was being ignored.\"\n\nCWE-285: Improper Authorization is also relevant as the **improper signature verification** allows for bypassing authorization checks. However, it is less specific and more of a consequence of the root cause. Therefore, it is a secondary CWE.\n\nThe retriever results showed CWE-347 as a relevant candidate with a base abstraction level and allowed usage. The relationship analysis further supports selecting CWE-347, as it is the initial flaw that leads to the authorization bypass.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-347 being a base-level CWE that accurately describes the **root cause** of the vulnerability and CWE-285 representing the broader impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
