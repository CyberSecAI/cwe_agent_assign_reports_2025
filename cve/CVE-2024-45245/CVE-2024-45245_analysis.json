While the retriever results suggest more specific base-level CWEs like CWE-359, CWE-497, CWE-1258, CWE-532, and CWE-1295, the lack of detailed information prevents a confident mapping to these more specific CWEs. CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE, and the mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific options are available. However, in this case, the limited information makes it the most appropriate choice. The evidence for this decision is the explicit mention of \"**Exposure of Sensitive Information**\" in the vulnerability description.",
