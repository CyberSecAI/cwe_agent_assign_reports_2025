```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The XPD Reduce Image Filesize plugin for WordPress lacks proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The plugin allows actions to be performed without proper validation of the request's origin.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site, leveraging their existing authentication. The specific impact depends on the actions available within the plugin that lack CSRF protection.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious actor could craft a request that, when executed by an authenticated user (e.g., via a link or embedded iframe), would trigger an action within the vulnerable plugin.",
