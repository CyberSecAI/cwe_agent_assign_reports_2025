This is a base-level CWE that describes accessing or using a pointer that has not been initialized. CWE-824 is a child of CWE-119 **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**.\n\nCWE-476 **NULL Pointer Dereference** is considered as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the pointer being uninitialized leading to a potential null dereference. CWE-476 is a child of CWE-754 **Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions**.\n\nCWE-457 **Use of Uninitialized Variable** is also considered because an uninitialized pointer is essentially an uninitialized variable holding a memory address. It's a variant level CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe824[\"CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\"]\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe457[\"CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe754[\"CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    cwe665[\"CWE-665: Improper Initialization\"]\n    \n    cwe824 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe476 -->|CHILDOF| cwe754\n    cwe457 -->|CHILDOF| cwe665\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe824 primary\n    class cwe476,cwe457 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **uninitialized pointer**, which leads to an **access of an uninitialized pointer**, and subsequently, a **denial of service** due to a potential **NULL pointer dereference**.\n  - **Root Cause:** Uninitialized pointer in the `InitialContextSetupResponseMsg` class.\n  - **Weakness:** CWE-824 **Access of Uninitialized Pointer** due to optional fields `pduSessionResourceSetupResponseList` and `pduSessionResourceFailedToSetupResponseList` not being initialized by default.\n  - **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) when the uninitialized pointer is dereferenced.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the root cause is an **uninitialized pointer dereference**. The evidence is strong because both the vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary highlight this.\n\nCWE-824 **Access of Uninitialized Pointer** is chosen as the primary CWE because it accurately describes the **root cause** of the vulnerability, where the code attempts to access a pointer that hasn't been properly initialized. This aligns with the description: \"The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\"\n\nCWE-476 **NULL Pointer Dereference** is a possible consequence, as an uninitialized pointer might contain a NULL value, leading to a dereference. However, CWE-824 is more precise in capturing the initial error. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also mentions \"Null pointer dereference\".\n\nCWE-457 **Use of Uninitialized Variable** is considered because the uninitialized pointer can be viewed as an uninitialized variable.\n\nThe graph relationships support the selection of CWE-824 because it's a base-level CWE directly related to memory management issues. The other CWEs represent potential consequences or related conditions. The evidence and relationships strongly support the primary classification of CWE-824.",
