## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved i2c stm32f7 **Do not prepare/unprepare clock during runtime suspend/resume** In case there is any sort of clock controller attached to this I2C bus controller, for example Versaclock or even an AIC32x4 I2C codec, then an I2C transfer triggered from the clock controller clk_ops .prepare callback may trigger a deadlock on drivers/clk/clk.c prepare_lock mutex. This is because the clock controller first grabs the prepare_lock mutex and then performs the prepare operation, including its I2C access. The I2C access resumes this I2C bus controller via .runtime_resume callback, which calls clk_prepare_enable(), which attempts to grab the prepare_lock mutex again and deadlocks. Since the clock are already prepared since probe() and unprepared in remove(), use simple clk_enable()/clk_disable() calls to enable and disable the clock on runtime suspend and resume, to avoid hitting the prepare_lock mutex.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Do not prepare/unprepare clock during runtime suspend/resume**
- **impact:** deadlock
- **vector:** I2C transfer from the clock controller clk_ops prepare callback
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** i2c stm32f7

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a potential deadlock situation in the `i2c-stm32f7` driver when a clock controller is attached to the I2C bus. Specifically, if a clock controller triggers an I2C transfer during its `clk_ops .prepare` callback, it can cause a deadlock.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability lies in the interaction between the clock controller's prepare callback, which acquires `prepare_lock` mutex, and the `i2c-stm32f7` driver's runtime resume callback. The `clk_prepare_enable()` function in the I2C driver tries to acquire `prepare_lock` mutex, which the clock controller already holds, leading to a deadlock.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is a deadlock, which would likely render the I2C bus and potentially other dependent functionalities unusable. This can lead to system instability or a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through interaction with the I2C bus. An I2C transfer triggered by the clock controller's `clk_ops .prepare` callback could trigger the deadlock.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker would need to control or influence the clock controller such that it attempts an I2C transfer from within its `prepare` callback.

**Technical Details:**
The core issue is that the `clk_prepare_enable()` function acquires the same `prepare_lock` mutex as the clock controller's prepare function, which leads to the described deadlock. The fix involves changing the runtime suspend/resume calls of the I2C clock from `clk_disable_unprepare`/`clk_prepare_enable` to `clk_disable`/`clk_enable`. The reason for this is that the clocks are already prepared/unprepared during probe()/remove(), thus the prepare/unprepare are redundant during suspend/resume, and prevent the deadlock from happening by not trying to acquire the mutex.

The fix in the provided patches replaces:
- `clk_disable_unprepare(i2c_dev->clk);` with `clk_disable(i2c_dev->clk);` in `stm32f7_i2c_runtime_suspend`
- `ret = clk_prepare_enable(i2c_dev->clk);` with `ret = clk_enable(i2c_dev->clk);` in `stm32f7_i2c_runtime_resume`.
