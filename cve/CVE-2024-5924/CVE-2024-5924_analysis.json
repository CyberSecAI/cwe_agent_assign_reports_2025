  "description": "Dropbox Desktop Folder Sharing Mark-of-the-Web Bypass Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web protection mechanism on affected installations of Dropbox Desktop. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of shared folders. When syncing files from a shared folder belonging to an untrusted account, the Dropbox desktop application does not apply the Mark-of-the-Web to the local files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-23991.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of shared folders by the Dropbox Desktop application. When files are synced from a shared folder belonging to an untrusted account, the application fails to apply the Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) security attribute to the local copies of these files.\n\n*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core vulnerability is a **Mark-of-the-Web bypass**. MOTW is a security feature that flags files downloaded from the internet as potentially untrusted, triggering security warnings before execution. By not applying MOTW to files synced from untrusted shared folders, Dropbox Desktop circumvents this protection.\n\n*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can leverage this bypass to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. This could allow the attacker to compromise the user's system, steal data, or perform other malicious actions.\n\n*   **Attack Vectors:**\n    *   The attack vector involves exploiting the handling of shared folders within Dropbox Desktop. An attacker would need to share a folder from an untrusted account containing malicious files.\n    *   The user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\n\n*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n    *   The attacker needs to have the ability to share a folder using an account that is considered \"untrusted\" by the target user's Dropbox application.\n    *   The attacker needs to be able to place malicious files inside the shared folder that will be synced to the target.\n    *   The attacker needs to entice the victim to interact with the malicious content, either by visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file.",

The application **incorrectly assigns permission** to the local files by not applying the Mark-of-the-Web attribute when syncing from an untrusted shared folder, leading to a bypass of security mechanisms. |\n| CWE-425 | Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate.

While it might be tempting to look for a more specific base CWE, CWE-732 accurately captures the essence of the vulnerability, where the **incorrect assignment of permissions** (or lack thereof) leads to the bypass. CWE-425 is a child of CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel), and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe288\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe732 primary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n    class cwe288,cwe862 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of shared folders**, specifically, the **failure to assign the Mark-of-the-Web attribute** to synced files.
