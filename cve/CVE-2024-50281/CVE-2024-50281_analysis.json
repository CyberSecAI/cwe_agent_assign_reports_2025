  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved KEYS trusted dcp fix **NULL dereference** in AEAD crypto operation When sealing or unsealing a key blob we currently do not wait for the AEAD cipher operation to finish and simply return after submitting the request. If there is some load on the system we can exit before the cipher operation is done and the buffer we read from/write to is already removed from the stack. This will e.g. result in NULL pointer dereference errors in the DCP driver during blob creation. Fix this by waiting for the AEAD cipher operation to finish before resuming the seal and unseal calls.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content relates to a fix for a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the Linux kernel's trusted key handling, specifically within the Data Center Processor (DCP) driver. This is within the scope of the described CVE which is a placeholder.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability arises from not waiting for the AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) cipher operation to complete before returning from the seal or unseal functions of key blobs. This occurs when there is load on the system and the function returns before the cipher operation is done, leading to a stack-allocated buffer being accessed after it has been removed from the stack.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Race Condition:** The code was vulnerable to a race condition where the AEAD cipher operation could be still in progress when the function returned.\n- **Use-After-Free:**  When the function returns early, the memory allocated for the buffer is freed, and the ongoing AEAD operation would then try to access this invalid memory, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **NULL pointer dereference:**  The most direct impact is a NULL pointer dereference, which can lead to a kernel crash.\n- **Denial of service:** A kernel crash will disrupt the system's operation and cause a denial-of-service.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The attack vector involves creating or processing key blobs using the trusted key infrastructure in the Linux kernel, triggering the vulnerable AEAD operations.\n- The specific scenario involves sealing or unsealing a key blob.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the key sealing or unsealing operation. This means the attacker must be in a position to interact with the trusted key subsystem of the kernel. This could be a privileged local user or through an exploit in another part of the system that allows interaction with the keys subsystem.\n\n**Technical details:**\n- The fix involves adding a `DECLARE_CRYPTO_WAIT(wait)` and setting the callback to `crypto_req_done` with the `wait` structure, followed by the use of `crypto_wait_req` in place of `crypto_aead_encrypt` and `crypto_aead_decrypt` to ensure that the function does not return until the AEAD operation is finished.\n- The vulnerable code was in the `do_aead_crypto` function within `security/keys/trusted-keys/trusted_dcp.c`.\n- The fix was applied to versions 6.10 and later.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The commit message mentions `Fixes: 0e28bf61a5f9 (\"KEYS: trusted: dcp: fix leak of blob encryption key\")`, indicating this issue is a follow-up fix to a previous patch.\n- The original report came from Parthiban N <parthiban@linumiz.com> and was discussed on the kernel mailing list.",

  "analysis": "# Summary\n| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| CWE-476 | NULL Pointer Dereference | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |\n| CWE-362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |\n| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is a **NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476)**, a base-level CWE, directly caused by a race condition where the system attempts to access memory after it has been freed. This race condition can be classified as **Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (CWE-362)**. The **NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476)** can also result from a **Use After Free (CWE-416)** which is a peer of **Expired Pointer Dereference (CWE-825)**. The relationship is that the improper synchronization allows for premature freeing of the memory, leading to a subsequent attempt to dereference the pointer, resulting in the **NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476)**. The base level CWEs are preferred because they are closest to the root cause, although the race condition is a contributing factor.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n\n    cwe476 <--|RESULT_OF| cwe362\n    cwe476 <--|RESULT_OF| cwe416\n    cwe416 --|PEER_OF| cwe825\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe476 primary\n    class cwe362,cwe416 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **Race Condition (CWE-362)** due to the system not waiting for the AEAD cipher operation to complete. This leads to premature freeing of the memory (**Use After Free (CWE-416)**) or access to invalid stack memory, eventually resulting in a **NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476)** when the system attempts to access the freed memory.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476)** as the primary weakness based on the vulnerability description and key phrases (\"**NULL dereference**\"). The supporting evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating the vulnerability arises from not waiting for the AEAD cipher operation to complete, leading to a stack-allocated buffer being accessed after it has been removed. The analysis also highlighted a **Race Condition (CWE-362)** because the code was vulnerable where the AEAD cipher operation could be still in progress when the function returned. The relationships between these CWEs show that the **Race Condition (CWE-362)** can lead to a **Use After Free (CWE-416)**, which in turn results in the **NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476)**. Therefore the **NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476)** is the primary CWE and the **Race Condition (CWE-362)** and the **Use After Free (CWE-416)** are secondary factors.
