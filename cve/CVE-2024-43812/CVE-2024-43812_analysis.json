The retriever results suggest exploring more specific Base-level CWEs related to credential storage. Specifically, CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) and CWE-257 (Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format) are considered due to their relevance to how credentials might be insufficiently protected. These are child or peer relationships that could be considered.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe257[\"CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\"]\n    \n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe257 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe522 primary\n    class cwe256,cwe257 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficiently protected credentials** (CWE-522), leading to the exposure of password hashes. This exposure enables an unauthenticated attacker with access to `/etc/passwd` to read these hashes. If the hashes are easily crackable due to weak algorithms or other factors, it could lead to unauthorized access and control of the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment points to CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mention \"**insufficiently protected credentials**\" as the root cause. The retriever results also list CWE-522 as the top candidate. While CWE-522 is a Class-level CWE, the evidence provided doesn't give enough information to determine if the credentials are in plaintext (CWE-256) or in a recoverable format (CWE-257), so I am keeping the selection as CWE-522.\n\nThe other CWEs listed in the retriever results, such as CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials), CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere), CWE-331 (Insufficient Entropy), CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort), CWE-912 (Hidden Functionality), CWE-836 (Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication), and CWE-942 (Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains) are not directly supported by the provided evidence. These alternative suggestions were not selected, because there was no evidence to support them.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* There is no direct evidence the hash algorithm is weak.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* There is no evidence to suggest the credentials themselves are weak.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* There is no evidence to suggest the credentials are hardcoded.\n\n## CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users.
