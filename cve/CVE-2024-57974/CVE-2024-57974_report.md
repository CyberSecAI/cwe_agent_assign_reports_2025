# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-57974

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved udp Deal with race between UDP socket address change and rehash If a UDP socket changes its local address while its receiving datagrams, as a result of connect(), there is a period during which a lookup operation might fail to find it, after the address is changed but before the secondary hash (port and address) and the four-tuple hash (local and remote ports and addresses) are updated. Secondary hash chains were introduced by commit 30fff9231fad (udp bind() optimisation) and, as a result, a rehash operation became needed to make a bound socket reachable again after a connect(). This operation was introduced by commit 719f835853a9 (udp add rehash on connect()) which isnt however a complete fix the socket will be found once the rehashing completes, but not while its pending. This is noticeable with a socat(1) server in UDP4-LISTEN mode, and a client sending datagrams to it. After the server receives the first datagram (cf. _xioopen_ipdgram_listen()), it issues a connect() to the address of the sender, in order to set up a directed flow. Now, if the client, running on a different CPU thread, happens to send a (subsequent) datagram while the servers socket changes its address, but is not rehashed yet, this will result in a failed lookup and a port unreachable error delivered to the client, as apparent from the following reproducer LEN=$(($(cat /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_default) / 4)) dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1 count=${LEN} of=tmp.in while do taskset -c 1 socat UDP4-LISTEN1337,null-eof OPENtmp.out,create,trunc & sleep 0.1 || sleep 1 taskset -c 2 socat OPENtmp.in UDP4localhost1337,shut-null wait done where the client will eventually get ECONNREFUSED on a write() (typically the second or third one of a given iteration) 2024/11/13 212823 socat[46901] E write(6, 0x556db2e3c000, 8192) Connection refused This issue was first observed as a seldom failure in Podmans tests checking UDP functionality while using pasta(1) to connect the containers network namespace, which leads us to a reproducer with the lookup error resulting in an ICMP packet on a tap device LOCAL_ADDR=$(ip -j -4 addr show|jq -rM .[] | .addr_info[0] | select(.scope == global).local) while do ./pasta --config-net -p pasta.pcap -u 1337 socat UDP4-LISTEN1337,null-eof OPENtmp.out,create,trunc & sleep 0.2 || sleep 1 socat OPENtmp.in UDP4${LOCAL_ADDR}1337,shut-null wait cmp tmp.in tmp.out done Once this fails tmp.in tmp.out differ char 8193, line 29 we can finally have a look at whats going on $ tshark -r pasta.pcap 1 0.000000 ? ff0216 ICMPv6 110 Multicast Listener Report Message v2 2 0.168690 88.198.0.161 ? 88.198.0.164 UDP 8234 60260 ? 1337 Len=8192 3 0.168767 88.198.0.161 ? 88.198.0.164 UDP 8234 60260 ? 1337 Len=8192 4 0.168806 88.198.0.161 ? 88.198.0.164 UDP 8234 60260 ? 1337 Len=8192 5 0.168827 c647058ddc04 ?

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | 1.0 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary identified CWE is CWE-362, which is a Class-level CWE. While it is a Class, the description of the vulnerability aligns directly with it. There may be more specific Base level CWEs that apply but the description provided doesn't specify which shared resource is improperly synchronized so it's difficult to choose a CWE without more information.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** (CWE-362) in the UDP socket address change and rehash process. This leads to a failed lookup, ultimately resulting in a port unreachable error delivered to the client.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" which explicitly mentions "**race condition**" as the root cause. The description details a scenario where a UDP socket changes its local address, creating a timing window where lookups can fail due to incomplete rehashing. This directly aligns with CWE-362, which describes concurrent execution accessing a shared resource without proper synchronization.

The retriever results also support this, listing CWE-362 as the top combined result with a score of 1.000.

Therefore, CWE-362 is the most appropriate mapping, and it is at the optimal level of specificity given the available information.
