  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved udp Deal with race between UDP socket address change and rehash If a UDP socket changes its local address while its receiving datagrams, as a result of connect(), there is a period during which a lookup operation might fail to find it, after the address is changed but before the secondary hash (port and address) and the four-tuple hash (local and remote ports and addresses) are updated. Secondary hash chains were introduced by commit 30fff9231fad (udp bind() optimisation) and, as a result, a rehash operation became needed to make a bound socket reachable again after a connect(). This operation was introduced by commit 719f835853a9 (udp add rehash on connect()) which isnt however a complete fix the socket will be found once the rehashing completes, but not while its pending. This is noticeable with a socat(1) server in UDP4-LISTEN mode, and a client sending datagrams to it. After the server receives the first datagram (cf. _xioopen_ipdgram_listen()), it issues a connect() to the address of the sender, in order to set up a directed flow. Now, if the client, running on a different CPU thread, happens to send a (subsequent) datagram while the servers socket changes its address, but is not rehashed yet, this will result in a failed lookup and a port unreachable error delivered to the client, as apparent from the following reproducer LEN=$(($(cat /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_default) / 4)) dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1 count=${LEN} of=tmp.in while do taskset -c 1 socat UDP4-LISTEN1337,null-eof OPENtmp.out,create,trunc & sleep 0.1 || sleep 1 taskset -c 2 socat OPENtmp.in UDP4localhost1337,shut-null wait done where the client will eventually get ECONNREFUSED on a write() (typically the second or third one of a given iteration) 2024/11/13 212823 socat[46901] E write(6, 0x556db2e3c000, 8192) Connection refused This issue was first observed as a seldom failure in Podmans tests checking UDP functionality while using pasta(1) to connect the containers network namespace, which leads us to a reproducer with the lookup error resulting in an ICMP packet on a tap device LOCAL_ADDR=$(ip -j -4 addr show|jq -rM .[] | .addr_info[0] | select(.scope == global).local) while do ./pasta --config-net -p pasta.pcap -u 1337 socat UDP4-LISTEN1337,null-eof OPENtmp.out,create,trunc & sleep 0.2 || sleep 1 socat OPENtmp.in UDP4${LOCAL_ADDR}1337,shut-null wait cmp tmp.in tmp.out done Once this fails tmp.in tmp.out differ char 8193, line 29 we can finally have a look at whats going on $ tshark -r pasta.pcap 1 0.000000 ? ff0216 ICMPv6 110 Multicast Listener Report Message v2 2 0.168690 88.198.0.161 ? 88.198.0.164 UDP 8234 60260 ? 1337 Len=8192 3 0.168767 88.198.0.161 ? 88.198.0.164 UDP 8234 60260 ? 1337 Len=8192 4 0.168806 88.198.0.161 ? 88.198.0.164 UDP 8234 60260 ? 1337 Len=8192 5 0.168827 c647058ddc04 ?
