## Vulnerability Description
CodiMD allows realtime collaborative markdown notes on all platforms. CodiMD before 2.5.4 is **missing authentication and access control** vulnerability allowing an unauthenticated attacker to gain unauthorised access to image data uploaded to CodiMD. CodiMD does not require valid authentication to access uploaded images or to upload new image data. An attacker who can determine an uploaded images URL can gain unauthorised access to uploaded image data. Due to the insecure random filename generation in the underlying Formidable library, an attacker can determine the filenames for previously uploaded images and the likelihood of this issue being exploited is increased. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.5.4.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **missing authentication and access control**
- **impact:** gain unauthorised access to image data
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attacker
- **product:** CodiMD
- **version:** before 2.5.4

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The primary root cause is the lack of authentication and access controls for uploaded images in CodiMD when using the Filesystem upload backend.
*   Secondary root cause is the use of the Formidable library's insecure random filename generation, making it easier for attackers to discover file paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication and Access Control (CWE-862):** CodiMD does not require authentication to access or upload image data. This allows unauthorized users to access any image if they know the URL or upload arbitrary files.
*   **Insecure Randomness (CWE-338):** The Formidable library, used by CodiMD, employs the `hexoid` library to generate random filenames. This library uses `Math.random()`, which is a weak random number generator, to create prefixes. It also uses an incrementing suffix. This predictable pattern allows attackers to guess or enumerate filenames of uploaded files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain access to any uploaded images, including those intended to be private.
*   **Data Exposure:** Private images could be viewed by unauthorized parties.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers can upload arbitrary image data, potentially exhausting disk space and causing a denial of service.
*   **Malicious Uploads:** An attacker can upload malicious images, possibly leading to further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Access:** An attacker can directly access uploaded images if they know the URL.
*   **Filename Enumeration:** An attacker can upload a file, determine the file prefix, and then guess the filenames of other files by incrementing the suffix and trying known mime types.
*   **Unauthenticated Uploads:** Attackers can upload files without authentication, facilitating both unauthorized access and DoS attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the CodiMD instance.
*   **No Prior Knowledge Required:** The attacker does not need valid user credentials.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the CodiMD server to upload files and access the uploaded images

**Additional details from the content:**

* The advisory notes that the issue was discovered during normal application use.
* It provides specific curl commands that demonstrate how to upload and access images without authentication.
* It shows example code snippets from the vulnerable section of code, and the vulnerable library (`hexoid`).
* Provides a detailed explanation of how the insecure filename generation works.
* Provides a code diff illustrating how to resolve the issue.
* It uses the term discretionary access control to emphasize that knowledge of a URL should not replace authorization controls
* A CVSS score and base metrics are provided
* Includes CWE-338 and CWE-862

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
