Specifically, the `dest`, `hostnet`, `netmask`, `gateway`, `interface`, `custom_interface`, and `comment` parameters are vulnerable.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n- CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command (\u2018Command Injection\u2019)\n- Lack of input validation/sanitization in the `internet.cgi` script.\n- Use of `popen` with unsanitized user input.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\n- Arbitrary command execution on the Wavlink AC3000 router.\n\nAttack vectors:\n- An attacker can send a crafted HTTP POST request to the `internet.cgi` script with malicious input in the vulnerable parameters.\n- Requires network access to the device.\n- Authentication is required (attacker needs to be a logged-in user).\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\n- Authenticated HTTP access to the router's web interface.\n- Knowledge of the vulnerable parameters and how to craft a malicious HTTP POST request.\n\nMitigation or fix:\n- The report does not specify a fix, but implies that proper input validation and sanitization are required to prevent command injection.\n- The vendor is working on patches, but the product has been discontinued.\n\nThis content provides more detail than the official CVE description.\n\nCVEs covered:\nCVE-2024-39764\nCVE-2024-39765\nCVE-2024-39763\nCVE-2024-39762",

CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77 and is more specific to OS commands, aligning directly with the vulnerability description. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) can precede CWE-78, indicating that lack of validation leads to command injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe78\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (potentially CWE-20). This leads to **improper neutralization of special elements** within the OS command, resulting in arbitrary command execution (CWE-78).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which explicitly mentions \"OS command injection\" and **lack of input validation/sanitization**. The vulnerability description mentions \"**Multiple OS command injection vulnerabilities** exist in the internet.cgi set_add_routing() functionality of Wavlink AC3000 M33A8.V5030.210505... A command injection vulnerability exists in the `gateway` POST parameter.\"\n\nThe relationship graph shows that CWE-78 is a more specific instance of command injection than the more general CWE-77. The retriever results also give a high score to CWE-78. Therefore, CWE-78 is the optimal choice. CWE-20 is included as a secondary candidate as it is a plausible cause for the **lack of sanitization**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
