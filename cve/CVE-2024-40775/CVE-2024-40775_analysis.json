The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms this by stating: \"A **downgrade issue** was present in AppleMobileFileIntegrity. This allowed for bypassing code signing restrictions.\" This directly aligns with CWE-757, \"Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade').\" The **weakness** that an app may be able to leak sensitive user information is a result of the **downgrade issue**, allowing for bypassing code signing restrictions. While other CWEs like CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) were considered based on the Retriever Results, they did not directly align with the provided evidence. The selection of CWE-757 is further supported by its 'Allowed' usage designation and its Base abstraction level.
