  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Alien Technology ALR-F800 up to 19.10.24.00. It has been classified as critical. Affected is an unknown function of the file /var/www/cmd.php. The manipulation of the argument cmd leads to **improper authorization**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. NOTE The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe root cause is a combination of insufficient input validation and improper authorization controls in the web interface of the Alien Technology ALR-F800 RFID reader. Specifically:\n\n1.  **`/cmd.php`**: Lack of authorization allows any user to send commands.\n2.  **`/cgi-bin/upgrade.cgi`**: The filename of the uploaded firmware is directly appended to the update command without sanitization, leading to command injection.\n3.  **`/admin/system.html`**: Filename is used in a command without sanitization, leading to command injection.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized Command Execution:** The `/cmd.php` script allows arbitrary command execution without authentication or authorization.\n*   **Command Injection:** The `/cgi-bin/upgrade.cgi` and `/admin/system.html` scripts are vulnerable to command injection via crafted filenames within the upload process.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Complete System Compromise:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying system, gaining full control over the device.\n*   **Credential Modification:** Attackers can reset web interface and SSH login credentials, effectively locking out legitimate users and maintaining persistent access.\n*   **Configuration Tampering:** Attackers can modify network configurations, potentially disrupting network communication and further compromising the network.\n*   **Webshell Deployment:** Attackers can deploy webshells for persistent backdoor access.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **HTTP POST Requests:** All vulnerabilities are exploited through crafted HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable scripts (`/cmd.php`, `/cgi-bin/upgrade.cgi`, `/admin/system.html`).\n*   **Malicious Filenames:** Command injection vulnerabilities in `/cgi-bin/upgrade.cgi` and `/admin/system.html` are triggered by uploading files with malicious filenames containing shell commands.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the ALR-F800 device's web interface.\n*   **No Authentication (for `/cmd.php`):** No prior authentication is required to exploit the `/cmd.php` vulnerability.\n*   **Authentication (for `/cgi-bin/upgrade.cgi` and `/admin/system.html`):** Basic authentication with a valid username and password (which can be obtained through `/cmd.php`) is needed to exploit the command injection in `/cgi-bin/upgrade.cgi` and Digest authentication for `/admin/system.html`.\n\n**Summary of Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **CVE-2024-7578**: This CVE refers to multiple vulnerabilities within the Alien Technology ALR-F800 RFID reader, specifically:\n    *   Unauthorized command execution via `/cmd.php`.\n    *   Command injection in `/cgi-bin/upgrade.cgi` via crafted filenames during firmware upgrade.\n    *   Command injection in `/admin/system.html` via crafted filenames during upload process.\n\nThis detailed analysis includes more information than the placeholder CVE description.",

CWE-306, \"Missing Authentication for Critical Function\", is a potential secondary CWE because the `/cmd.php` script allows arbitrary command execution without authentication. CWE-78, \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\" is also a potential secondary CWE given the presence of command injection vulnerabilities in `/cgi-bin/upgrade.cgi` and `/admin/system.html`. CWE-285 is a Class-level CWE, while CWE-306 and CWE-78 are Base-level CWEs, offering a more specific representation of the weaknesses.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe78 secondary\n    class cwe74,cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper authorization** in `/cmd.php` (CWE-285), potentially due to **missing authentication** (CWE-306). This allows an attacker to gain access to the system and then leverage **command injection** vulnerabilities (CWE-78) in `/cgi-bin/upgrade.cgi` and `/admin/system.html` to execute arbitrary commands and fully compromise the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The primary weakness is **improper authorization**, as the `/cmd.php` script allows command execution without proper checks. The detailed analysis provided in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary strengthens this assessment by explicitly stating the **lack of authorization** for `/cmd.php`. The secondary weaknesses are the **missing authentication** and the **command injection** vulnerabilities.\n\nThe graph relationships show how **improper authorization** can stem from **missing authentication**, and how **improper neutralization of special elements** can lead to command injection. The selection of CWE-285, CWE-306, and CWE-78 is based on the evidence provided, and these CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity (Base and Class).\n\nCWE-284, \"Improper Access Control,\" was considered but not used because CWE-285, \"Improper Authorization,\" is more specific and accurately reflects the **improper authorization** detailed in the vulnerability description. CWE-862 \"Missing Authorization\" was considered, but CWE-285 was deemed a better fit because the vulnerability description states \"**improper authorization**\" as opposed to simply \"missing authorization.\" The presence of both **improper authorization** and **missing authentication** are present.\nCWE-89, \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\", CWE-79, \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\", CWE-705, \"Incorrect Control Flow Scoping\", CWE-266, \"Incorrect Privilege Assignment\", CWE-863, \"Incorrect Authorization\", and CWE-184, \"Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\" were not chosen because they did not directly relate to the weaknesses described in the vulnerability.",
