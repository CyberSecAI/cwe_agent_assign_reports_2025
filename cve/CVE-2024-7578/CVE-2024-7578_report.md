## Description

A vulnerability was found in Alien Technology ALR-F800 up to 19.10.24.00. It has been classified as critical. Affected is an unknown function of the file /var/www/cmd.php. The manipulation of the argument cmd leads to **improper authorization**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. NOTE The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** improper authorization
- **Product:** Alien Technology ALR-F800
- **Version:** up to 19.10.24.00

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-285 | Improper Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-285, "Improper Authorization", because the vulnerability description states that the manipulation of the argument `cmd` leads to **improper authorization**. CWE-306, "Missing Authentication for Critical Function", is a potential secondary CWE because the `/cmd.php` script allows arbitrary command execution without authentication. CWE-78, "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')" is also a potential secondary CWE given the presence of command injection vulnerabilities in `/cgi-bin/upgrade.cgi` and `/admin/system.html`. CWE-285 is a Class-level CWE, while CWE-306 and CWE-78 are Base-level CWEs, offering a more specific representation of the weaknesses.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper authorization** in `/cmd.php` (CWE-285), potentially due to **missing authentication** (CWE-306). This allows an attacker to gain access to the system and then leverage **command injection** vulnerabilities (CWE-78) in `/cgi-bin/upgrade.cgi` and `/admin/system.html` to execute arbitrary commands and fully compromise the system.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The primary weakness is **improper authorization**, as the `/cmd.php` script allows command execution without proper checks. The detailed analysis provided in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary strengthens this assessment by explicitly stating the **lack of authorization** for `/cmd.php`. The secondary weaknesses are the **missing authentication** and the **command injection** vulnerabilities.

The graph relationships show how **improper authorization** can stem from **missing authentication**, and how **improper neutralization of special elements** can lead to command injection. The selection of CWE-285, CWE-306, and CWE-78 is based on the evidence provided, and these CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity (Base and Class).

CWE-284, "Improper Access Control," was considered but not used because CWE-285, "Improper Authorization," is more specific and accurately reflects the **improper authorization** detailed in the vulnerability description. CWE-862 "Missing Authorization" was considered, but CWE-285 was deemed a better fit because the vulnerability description states "**improper authorization**" as opposed to simply "missing authorization." The presence of both **improper authorization** and **missing authentication** are present.
CWE-89, "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')", CWE-79, "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", CWE-705, "Incorrect Control Flow Scoping", CWE-266, "Incorrect Privilege Assignment", CWE-863, "Incorrect Authorization", and CWE-184, "Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs" were not chosen because they did not directly relate to the weaknesses described in the vulnerability.
