  "description": "A flaw was found in Aardvark-dns, which is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack due to the **serial processing of TCP DNS queries**. An attacker can exploit this flaw by keeping a TCP connection open indefinitely, causing the server to become unresponsive and resulting in other DNS queries timing out. This issue prevents legitimate users from accessing DNS services, thereby disrupting normal operations and causing service downtime.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-8418:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from how `aardvark-dns` (versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1) handles TCP DNS queries. It processes these queries serially, meaning it handles them one after another instead of concurrently.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Serial TCP processing:**  Aardvark-dns processes TCP DNS requests one at a time.\n- **Lack of connection management:** The service does not properly handle persistent TCP connections and lacks timeouts.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can establish a TCP connection and send very little or no data, effectively holding the connection open indefinitely. This blocks the service from processing new DNS queries from other clients.\n- **Unresponsive Server:**  The server becomes unresponsive due to the blocked connection(s).\n- **DNS Query Timeouts:** Legitimate DNS queries start timing out, causing service downtime and preventing users from accessing DNS services.\n- **Disrupted Operations:** The DoS attack disrupts normal operations by making DNS services unavailable.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Malicious TCP Client:** An attacker needs to be able to establish a TCP connection to the `aardvark-dns` service.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to reach the aardvark-dns service and open a TCP connection.\n- **Ability to send TCP packets:** The attacker needs to be able to send TCP packets and keep a connection open to the service.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n-  The vulnerability is specific to TCP queries, UDP requests are processed differently.\n- The fix for the vulnerability involves processing TCP requests concurrently and adding a timeout to TCP connections.\n- The issue was reported as impacting podman containers where DNS resolution would stop working after some time due to the aardvark-dns service becoming unresponsive.\n- The fix was implemented by spawning a new task for each new TCP connection and adding a 3-second timeout to all TCP connections, preventing clients from holding connections open indefinitely.\n\nThis information provides more detail than the CVE description, explaining the technical root cause and how an attacker could exploit the vulnerability.",

It has child CWEs that are more specific but don't directly apply to the serial processing aspect of this vulnerability. CWE-799 is related as it describes the lack of limits on interaction frequency which leads to resource exhaustion. CWE-923 is a Class that is not a good fit, but related to the weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe799[\"CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency\"]\n    cwe923[\"CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\"]\n    \n    cwe799 -->|PEEROF| cwe400\n    cwe923 -->|PEEROF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe799,cwe923 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **serial processing of TCP DNS queries** and **Lack of connection management**, leading to **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** and ultimately resulting in a Denial of Service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description and the retriever results, points to **CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption)** as the primary weakness. The vulnerability involves the **serial processing of TCP DNS queries** which allows an attacker to keep a TCP connection open indefinitely, exhausting server resources.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-799 (Improper Control of Interaction Frequency) and CWE-923 (Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints) as potential candidates.\n\nCWE-400 is chosen as the primary CWE because the core issue is that the server does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of resources (TCP connections), leading to resource exhaustion and a DoS. While CWE-400 is discouraged, the rationale fits the root cause well.\n\nCWE-799 is chosen as a secondary CWE because the server does not properly limit the frequency of interactions, allowing a single attacker to exhaust resources.\n\nCWE-923 is a less direct fit, but is added since it is possible the service does not properly ensure it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-400 being a Class that adequately describes the resource consumption issue, and the others representing related aspects of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not used because:* This vulnerability does not involve assertions.\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not used because:* While possibly related, the core issue is resource exhaustion.\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not used because:* Origin validation is not the primary issue.\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not used because:* Algorithmic complexity is not the root cause.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
