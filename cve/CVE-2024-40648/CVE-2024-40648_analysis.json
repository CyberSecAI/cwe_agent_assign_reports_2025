  "description": "matrix-rust-sdk is an implementation of a Matrix client-server library in Rust. The `UserIdentityis_verified()` method in the matrix-sdk-crypto crate before version 0.7.2 **doesnt take into account the verification status of the users own identity** while performing the check and may as a result return a value contrary to what is implied by its name and documentation. If the method is used to decide whether to perform sensitive operations towards a user identity, a malicious homeserver could manipulate the outcome in order to make the identity appear trusted. This is not a typical usage of the method, which lowers the impact. The method itself is not used inside the `matrix-sdk-crypto` crate. The 0.7.2 release of the `matrix-sdk-crypto` crate includes a fix. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-40648:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe `UserIdentity::is_verified()` method in the `matrix-sdk-crypto` crate, prior to version 0.7.2, incorrectly determines the verification status of a user identity. It does not consider the verification status of the user's *own* identity when checking if another user's identity is verified. This means that if a user's own identity was not verified, it would still consider another user's identity verified if it was signed by the user, which is incorrect.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Incorrect Logic:** The `is_verified()` method had faulty logic in how it checked the verification status of other user's identities. It failed to check if the current user's identity was verified before considering another identity verified, leading to inconsistent results.\n- **Trust Issue:** The method, when used to decide whether to perform sensitive actions towards a user identity, would lead to the system considering a user as trusted even if that was not actually the case.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Bypassed Trust:** A malicious homeserver could potentially manipulate the outcome of the `is_verified()` method to make an unverified user identity appear trusted. This could be used to bypass trust-based mechanisms.\n- **Potential Sensitive Operation:** If the flawed logic is used to determine whether a user should have sensitive operations performed, that could lead to sensitive data exposure or unauthorized actions. However, the code was not used directly by the library itself to make any decisions.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Malicious Homeserver:** A malicious homeserver would need to be able to control the verification status of identities and responses from the server that is returned to the client. This will allow them to present other identities as verified to the client.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- The attacker needs to have control over a homeserver or be able to manipulate responses from a homeserver that is being used by a client.\n- The attacker doesn't need to access the client directly.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The vulnerability is described as \"Moderate\" in severity.\n- The fix was implemented in commit [76a7052](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/commit/76a7052149bb8f722df12da915b3a06d19a6695a).\n- The method was not used within the library itself and is used by the user of the library, limiting its impact.\n- The vulnerability was discovered by dkasak and the remediation was done by poljar.\n- The fix adds a regression test to ensure this does not happen again.",

The method **doesn't take into account the verification status of the users own identity** while performing the check and may as a result return a value contrary to what is implied by its name and documentation.\n\nThe selection of CWE-287, Improper Authentication, is based on the fact that the method's intended purpose is to verify user identities, but it fails to do so correctly. This failure can lead to authentication bypass scenarios, aligning with CWE-287.\n\nCWE-290, Authentication Bypass by Spoofing, and CWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, were considered as the primary CWE, but they are more specific and don't fully capture the root cause. CWE-290 implies an active attempt to deceive the system, while CWE-863 focuses on authorization checks, which are not the primary issue here.\n\nThe decision to use CWE-287 as the primary CWE is based on its ability to encompass the broader issue of flawed identity verification, which can lead to various authentication-related vulnerabilities.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThis attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
