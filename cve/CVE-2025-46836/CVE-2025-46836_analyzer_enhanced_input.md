## Vulnerability Description
net-tools is a collection of programs that form the base set of the NET-3 networking distribution for the Linux operating system. Inn versions up to and including 2.10, the Linux network utilities (like ifconfig) from the net-tools package do not properly validate the structure of /proc files when showing interfaces. `get_name()` in `interface.c` copies interface labels from `/proc/net/dev` into a fixed 16-byte stack buffer without bounds checking, leading to possible arbitrary code execution or crash. The known attack path does not require privilege but also does not provide privilege escalation in this scenario. A patch is available and expected to be part of version 2.20.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## CVE-2025-46836 - Analysis of Provided Content

The provided content relates to CVE-2025-46836. It contains detailed information about the vulnerability, its impact, and mitigation steps. Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The Linux network utilities (net-tools) do not properly validate the structure of `/proc` files when showing interfaces. Specifically, the `get_name()` function in `interface.c` copies interface labels from `/proc/net/dev` into a fixed 16-byte stack buffer without bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-20, CWE-121)

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Possible arbitrary code execution
*   Crash

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack path does not require privilege, but does not provide privilege escalation.
*   Exploitation involves crafting a malicious `/proc/net/dev` file with an interface alias longer than 15 bytes. The provided proof of concept demonstrates this using unprivileged user namespaces.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Local access to the system.
*   Ability to create and modify files in a `/proc` filesystem (achieved through unprivileged user namespaces in the PoC).

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Upgrade `net-tools` to version 2.20 or later.
*   (Optional) Disable unprivileged user namespaces (`sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0`) to remove the easiest non-privileged trigger path.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   **Affected versions:** <= 2.10
*   **Fixed version:** 2.20
*   **Debian specific information:** Debian LTS advisory DLA-4202-1, Debian Bug 1105806, version 1.60+git20181103.0eebece-1+deb11u2 fixes the issue for Debian 11 bullseye.
*   **CVSS Score:** Moderate, 6.6 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H)
*   **Credits:** Discovered and reported by Mohamed Maatallah (@Zephkek).
*   **Proof of Concept:** A detailed PoC is provided, demonstrating how to create a malicious `/proc/net/dev` file and trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Code Snippet:** The vulnerable code in `interface.c` is included, highlighting the lack of bounds checking.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set ‚Äì Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* üîç *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* üîç *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion ‚Äì CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### üî∏ CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúA user created with the ‚Äòguest‚Äô role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúThe backup service runs as root but only needs read access.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### üî∏ CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúUser can access another user‚Äôs invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.‚Äù*

## Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *‚ÄúUser can escalate privileges to admin.‚Äù*
> ‚ùå Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged ‚Äì only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ‚úÖ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**
