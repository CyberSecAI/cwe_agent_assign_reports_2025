CWE-346, Origin Validation Error, is a parent of CWE-940 and a child of CWE-923. CWE-923 is chosen as the primary due to the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning a failure to validate the communication channel endpoint.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe923[\"CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\"]\n    cwe346[\"CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\"]\n    cwe940[\"CWE-940: Improper Verification of Source of a Communication Channel\"]\n\n    cwe346 -->|CHILDOF| cwe923\n    cwe940 -->|CHILDOF| cwe346\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe923 primary\n    class cwe346 secondary\n    class cwe940 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to properly validate that the channel is a shared channel**. This leads to the impact of being able to add users to arbitrary teams and channels.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which states the **rootcause** as a \"**fail to properly validate that the channel is a shared channel**\". This directly aligns with CWE-923, Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints, as the application doesn't properly ensure it's communicating with the correct endpoint (the shared channel). The description also indicates that a sync message is the attack vector. The selection of CWE-923 is further supported by its high score in the Retriever Results. CWE-346, Origin Validation Error, is a possible secondary CWE because the channel origin is not being validated. However, the primary issue seems to be the channel endpoint rather than the origin, making CWE-923 the more appropriate primary classification. CWE-923 is a Class, a more specific Base CWE could be present but would require more information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
