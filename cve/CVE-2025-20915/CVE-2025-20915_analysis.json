The description explicitly states an \"Out-of-bounds read\" vulnerability. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship observed is that CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is a base CWE. While several other CWEs are related through \"CanPrecede\" and \"CanFollow\" relationships, the direct match of \"Out-of-bounds Read\" makes CWE-125 the most appropriate and specific choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe125 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain here is straightforward.
