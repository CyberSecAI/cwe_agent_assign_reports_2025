This leads to the exposure of sensitive data, including emails and hashed passwords.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **Sensitive Information Exposure**. The retriever results suggested CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) and CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor). After reviewing the CWE descriptions, CWE-201 was chosen as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description indicates that sensitive information is being sent in data via shortcodes. CWE-200 remains a secondary candidate. Also CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor) seems like a good fit.\n\nThe selection is primarily based on the vulnerability description key phrases: \"**weakness:** **Sensitive Information Exposure**\", \"**impact:** extract sensitive data including emails as well as hashed passwords\".
