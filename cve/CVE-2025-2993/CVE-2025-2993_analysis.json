CWE-425 (Direct Request) was considered a possible secondary CWE as it relates to missing authorization checks on specific URLs or files.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    \n    cwe266 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe266 primary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n    class cwe285 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access controls** (CWE-266), leading to unauthorized access to functionality via manipulation of arguments. The manipulation of the argument can lead to direct requests (CWE-425) to the /default.cfg file without proper privilege assignment.\n  - Root Cause: CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment)\n  - Impact: Unauthorized access to /default.cfg due to missing checks (CWE-425).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states **\"improper access controls\"** as the root cause, pointing directly to authorization issues. CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) best captures this because it addresses the assignment of incorrect privileges, while CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is a more general class. CWE-425 (Direct Request) is added as a secondary weakness because the vulnerability allows direct requests to resources due to the lack of proper authorization checks. The analysis relies heavily on the provided vulnerability description key phrases.\n\nCWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')), CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')), CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')), and CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine) were considered but not selected because the description does not indicate any form of injection. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) were not chosen as the problem is not missing authentication, but rather incorrect privilege assignment.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n*   CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n*   CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')",
