It provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nA SQL injection vulnerability was found in the '/view-ticket-admin.php?id=1' file of the 'Online Food Ordering System' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter 'id' and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n* SQL injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAttackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n* The '/view-ticket-admin.php?id=1' file is vulnerable. The 'id' parameter is the entry point for the attack.\n* No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n* An attacker needs to be able to craft malicious SQL queries and send them via the 'id' parameter in a GET request. No authentication is required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n* Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n* Input validation and filtering.\n* Minimize database user permissions.\n* Regular security audits.\n\n**Payload examples:**\n\n* `id=1 AND 8970=8970` (boolean-based blind)\n* `id=1 AND (SELECT 9293 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))vrRO)` (time-based blind)\n* `id=-5287 UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,CONCAT(0x716b7a7671,0x63624E41474a4f4142745852625672646e6c636a4E44574e547556414a7951687a56434548716442,0x717a767671),NULL,NULL-- -` (UNION query)",

This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. The evidence provided, including the vulnerability description, CVE reference links, and retriever results, all strongly support this classification. The CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity, being a Base level CWE that directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability.
