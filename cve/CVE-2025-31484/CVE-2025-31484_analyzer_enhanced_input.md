## Vulnerability Description
conda-forge infrastructure holds common configurations and settings for key pieces of the conda-forge infrastructure. Between 2025-02-10 and 2025-04-01, conda-forge infrastructure used the **wrong token for Azures cf-staging access**. This bug meant that any feedstock maintainer could upload a package to the conda-forge channel, bypassing our feedstock-token + upload process. The security logs on anaconda.org were check for any packages that were not copied from the cf-staging to the conda-forge channel and none were found.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **wrong token for Azures cf-staging access**
- **impact:** upload a package to the conda-forge channel
- **attacker:** any feedstock maintainer
- **component:** conda-forge infrastructure

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## CVE-2025-31484 Analysis

Here's an analysis of the provided content related to CVE-2025-31484, extracted and formatted according to the guidelines:

**1. Verification:**

The content directly relates to CVE-2025-31484 as it explicitly states the CVE ID.

**2. Relevant Content Extraction:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect variable injected into the Azure variable group in the Pulumi configuration, using the production Binstar token instead of the staging one. This was introduced during a Pulumi configuration update and missed during code review.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Incorrect configuration management leading to the use of a production token in a staging environment. This allowed bypassing the intended feedstock-token + upload process.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Any feedstock maintainer could upload a package to the conda-forge channel, potentially introducing malicious packages.
*   **Attack vectors:** A malicious or compromised feedstock maintainer could exploit the misconfiguration to upload unauthorized packages.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires being a conda-forge feedstock maintainer.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** Corrected the Pulumi configuration to use the staging Binstar token in the Azure variable group. Patched versions are >=2025-04-02.
*   **Affected versions:** >=2025-02-10, <=2025-04-01
*   **Severity:** Critical

**3. Additional Details:**

The provided content offers significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, including:

*   Specific details about the configuration error.
*   The individuals involved in identifying and remediating the issue.
*   Investigation steps taken to determine if the vulnerability was exploited.
*   The reason for keeping the variable name (backwards compatibility with smithy).
