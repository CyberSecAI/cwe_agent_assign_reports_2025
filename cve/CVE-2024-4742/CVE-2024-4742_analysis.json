  "description": "The Youzify - BuddyPress Community, User Profile, Social Network & Membership Plugin for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the order_by shortcode attribute in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.5 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-4742:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability is due to insufficient escaping of user-supplied input in the `order_by` shortcode attribute within the Youzify plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to properly sanitize this parameter before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL Injection, caused by the lack of proper input sanitization and preparation of SQL queries. The `order_by` attribute is directly incorporated into the SQL query without proper escaping or sanitization, allowing for SQL injection.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:\n  - **Data Extraction:** The attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, personal data, and other confidential information.\n  - **Data Manipulation:** An attacker might modify data, delete records, or add malicious content to the database.\n  - **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability:** As indicated by the CVSS score of 9.8, this vulnerability allows for a complete loss of these three security pillars.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The attack vector is through the `order_by` shortcode attribute of the `youzify_verified_users` shortcode. This means that anywhere this shortcode is utilized, an attacker can potentially exploit the vulnerability.\n- The attacker must be able to use the shortcode.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have at least \"Contributor\" level access to the WordPress site. This is not a privilege escalation vulnerability. Any logged-in user with this level of access or greater can exploit the vulnerability.\n- **Shortcode Usage:** The attacker needs to be able to insert and utilize the vulnerable shortcode (i.e. youzify_verified_users) on the site.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The Wordfence article notes that the vulnerability was found by Peter Thaleikis.\n- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Youzify plugin up to and including 1.2.5. It has been patched in version 1.2.6.\n- The provided code snippet from `youzify-account-verification-functions.php` does not contain the vulnerable code. It provides account verification functions, but the SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `youzify_verified_users_shortcode` function.\n- The `order_by` parameter in shortcode is used in the SQL query without proper sanitization, which leads to SQL injection vulnerability.",
