However, given the limited information, the description explicitly mentions \"**improper authentication**,\" directly aligning with the definition of CWE-287. The guidance suggests considering CWE-306 \"Missing Authentication for Critical Function\", but the provided description does not state that authentication is missing, only that it is improper.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe287 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of one step: the **improper authentication**, which leads to information disclosure. The root cause is the **improper authentication**, and the impact is information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly suggests CWE-287, given the explicit mention of \"**improper authentication**\" in the vulnerability description. The retriever results also point towards authentication-related CWEs.
