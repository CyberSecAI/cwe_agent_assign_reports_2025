CWE-798 is a more general case of using hardcoded credentials. Since the vulnerability description specifies a \"hardcoded password\", CWE-259 is more specific and thus preferred. CWE-1393 is related, but applies specifically to default passwords, which isn't explicitly mentioned, so it's a weaker secondary candidate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe1393[\"CWE-1393: Use of Default Password\"]\n    \n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe1393 -->|PEEROF| cwe259\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe259 primary\n    class cwe798,cwe1393 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-259 - Use of Hard-coded Password\n2.  **Impact:** Attackers can log in as root.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a \"**hardcoded password**\" exists in `/etc_ro/shadow`, allowing attackers to log in as root.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) because the description specifically mentions a hardcoded password. This aligns with the CWE description and the allowed usage rationale. The retriever results also list CWE-259 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) is a parent of CWE-259 and is considered as a secondary CWE because it is a more general case.\n\nCWE-1393 (Use of Default Password) is considered as another secondary CWE because it might be the case the **hardcoded password** is a default password, but this is not explicitly mentioned.\n\nThe confidence is high (0.9) because the vulnerability description directly matches the CWE-259 description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following
