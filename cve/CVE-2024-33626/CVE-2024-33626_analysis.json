  "description": "The LevelOne WBR-6012 router contains a vulnerability within its web application that allows unauthenticated disclosure of sensitive information, such as the WiFi WPS PIN, through a hidden page accessible by an HTTP request. Disclosure of this information could enable attackers to connect to the devices WiFi network.",

    "rootcause": "",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe root cause is the presence of a hidden web page (`sysinfo.htm`) within the LevelOne WBR-6012 router's web application that exposes sensitive information.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Information Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive data, specifically the WiFi WPS PIN, through the `sysinfo.htm` page. This page is accessible without authentication.\n- **Lack of Access Control:** The web application fails to restrict access to the `sysinfo.htm` page, allowing unauthenticated users to view its contents.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized WiFi Access:** The disclosed WiFi WPS PIN allows an attacker to connect to the device's WiFi network without authorization. This could lead to various malicious activities, including network eavesdropping, data theft, and launching further attacks within the network.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending an HTTP request to the `sysinfo.htm` page. No special tools or techniques are required to initiate this request.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network Accessibility:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router. This could mean being on the same local network as the router or potentially accessing it remotely if the router's web interface is exposed to the internet.\n- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any credentials to access the vulnerable `sysinfo.htm` page.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- The vulnerability is present in LevelOne WBR-6012 R0.40e6.\n- The CVSSv3 score is 5.3, indicating a medium severity vulnerability.\n- The CWE is CWE-200, which categorizes this as an Information Exposure vulnerability.",

CWE-306 [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function] is a more specific case of improper authentication, and accurately reflects the scenario where a critical function (accessing the `sysinfo.htm` page) lacks any authentication. Also, CWE-200 [CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information] is a consequence of the **missing authentication**. It is the impact, rather than the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** for the `sysinfo.htm` page (CWE-306 [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function]). This leads to the **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200 [CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information]), specifically the WiFi WPS PIN, which then allows for unauthorized access to the WiFi network.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **exposure of sensitive information**, but further examination revealed that the root cause is the **lack of authentication** for a critical function (accessing the hidden page). The evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section clearly states: \"Lack of Access Control: The web application fails to restrict access to the `sysinfo.htm` page, allowing unauthenticated users to view its contents.\" This directly supports the selection of CWE-306 [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function] as the primary CWE. While CWE-200 [CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information] is a valid concern and impact, it is a consequence of the **missing authentication** rather than the root cause itself. The retriever results also showed CWE-306 [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function] as a strong candidate. CWE-306 [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function] is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately describes the root cause: a critical function lacks any authentication mechanism.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n*   **CWE-306 [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function]:** The product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n*   **CWE-200 [CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information]:** The product exposes sensitive information to an actor when it should not. This may lead to privacy violations, stolen credentials, fraud, identity theft, etc.\n\nCWEs Considered but Not Used:\n\n*   CWE-425 [CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')]: While 'forced browsing' might be involved, it's a technique, not the core weakness. The root cause is the **missing authentication**, not merely the direct request.\n*   CWE-912 [CWE-912: Hidden Functionality]: The vulnerability is not due to the functionality being hidden, but due to the **lack of access control** on it.\n*   CWE-798 [CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials]: There is no evidence of **hard-coded credentials** being used.",
