  "description": "PDF-XChange Editor Doc Object **Out-Of-Bounds Read** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of Doc objects. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a **read past the end of an allocated buffer**. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-25372.",
