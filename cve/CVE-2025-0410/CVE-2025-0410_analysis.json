  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-0410 Content\n\nBased on the provided content, this relates to a SQL injection vulnerability.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe `hyname` parameter in the `query` method of `src/main/java/com/liujian/gymxmjpa/controller/MenberConntroller.java` was not filtered.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nThe impact is not explicitly stated, but SQL injection can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, and potentially complete system compromise.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nThe vulnerability is exploited by crafting malicious SQL queries through the `hyname` parameter in the URL. Examples provided include:\n\n*   `http://192.168.0.104:8090/menber/query?ktype=2&pageNumber=1&pageSize=10&hyname=Tom%27%20AND%20length(database())=3%20AND%20%27PiXZ%25%27=%27PiXZ` (to determine database length)\n*   `http://192.168.0.104:8090/menber/query?ktype=2&pageNumber=1&pageSize=10&hyname=Tom%25%27%20AND%20substr(database(),1,1)%20=%20%27g%27%20AND%20%27PiXZ%25%27=%27PiXZ` (to extract database name character by character)\n*   `http://192.168.0.104:8090/menber/query?ktype=2&pageNumber=1&pageSize=10&hyname=Tom%25%27%20AND%20substr(database(),2,1)%20=%20%27y%27%20AND%20%27PiXZ%25%27=%27PiXZ`\n*   `http://192.168.0.104:8090/menber/query?ktype=2&pageNumber=1&pageSize=10&hyname=Tom%25%27%20AND%20substr(database(),3,1)%20=%20%27m%27%20AND%20%27PiXZ%25%27=%27PiXZ`\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\nAn attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required based on the provided information.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not provide specific mitigation or fix details, but it implies that proper input validation and sanitization of the `hyname` parameter are necessary to prevent SQL injection.",

There are no parent-child or chain relationships needed in this case, as the evidence directly supports the selection of CWE-89 as the root cause. The abstraction level is Base, which is the preferred level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of the following:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper neutralization** of special elements in SQL commands (CWE-89).\n2.  **Impact:** SQL Injection leading to potential data breaches, data manipulation, or complete system compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly indicates an SQL Injection vulnerability. The \"**sql injection**\" key phrase, along with the description of the **lack of** input validation for the `hyname` parameter, directly aligns with CWE-89. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the primary candidate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly describes the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
