  "description": "A **path traversal vulnerability** exists in rsync. It stems from behavior enabled by the `--inc-recursive` option, a default-enabled option for many client options and can be enabled by the server even if not explicitly enabled by the client. When using the `--inc-recursive` option, a **lack of proper symlink verification** coupled with deduplication checks occurring on a per-file-list basis could allow a server to write files outside of the clients intended destination directory. A malicious server could write malicious files to arbitrary locations named after valid directories/paths on the client.",

The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **lack of proper symlink verification**, and the CVE reference links confirm that the vulnerability involves issues with symbolic links.
