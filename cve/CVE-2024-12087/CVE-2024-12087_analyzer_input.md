# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-12087

## Vulnerability Description
A **path traversal vulnerability** exists in rsync. It stems from behavior enabled by the `--inc-recursive` option, a default-enabled option for many client options and can be enabled by the server even if not explicitly enabled by the client. When using the `--inc-recursive` option, a **lack of proper symlink verification** coupled with deduplication checks occurring on a per-file-list basis could allow a server to write files outside of the clients intended destination directory. A malicious server could write malicious files to arbitrary locations named after valid directories/paths on the client.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **lack of proper symlink verification**
- **weakness:** **path traversal vulnerability**
- **impact:** write files outside of the clients intended destination directory
- **vector:** path traversal
- **attacker:** malicious server
- **product:** rsync

*   **1. Verify if the content relates to the CVE specified based on the official description**

    *   The content is a Red Hat Bugzilla entry for CVE-2024-12087, so it is directly related.
*   **4. For relevant content, extract it if exists**
    *   **Root cause of vulnerability:**
        *   The issue is in the syncing of symbolic links when enabled through `-l` or `-a` (`--archive`) flags.
    *   **Impact of exploitation:**
        *   A malicious server can make the client write arbitrary files outside of the destination directory.
    *   **Mitigation or fix:**
        *   This issue has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via RHSA-2025:2600 and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via RHSA-2025:7050.

**Analysis of Content from bugzilla.redhat.com_a324e70f_20250624_210206.html:**

*   **1. Verify if the content relates to the CVE specified based on the official description**

    *   The content is a Red Hat Bugzilla entry for CVE-2024-12747, which is related to the rsync vulnerabilities.
*   **4. For relevant content, extract it if exists**
    *   **Root cause of vulnerability:**
        *   A race condition in rsync's handling of symbolic links.
    *   **Impact of exploitation:**
        *   By exploiting timing differences, an attacker can bypass the expected behavior of skipping symbolic links during file synchronization. This flaw becomes critical in scenarios where rsync runs with elevated privileges, as it can inadvertently expose sensitive files to unprivileged users, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
    *   **Mitigation or fix:**
        *   This issue has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via RHSA-2025:2600 and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via RHSA-2025:7050.

    *   **Root cause of vulnerability:**
        *   The `--safe-links` option fails to verify whether a symbolic link destination contains another symbolic link within it.
    *   **Impact of exploitation:**
        *   A path traversal vulnerability, which may lead to arbitrary files being written outside of the desired directory.
