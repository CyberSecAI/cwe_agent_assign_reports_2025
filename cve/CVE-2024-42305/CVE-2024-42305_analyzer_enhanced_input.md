## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ext4 check dot and dotdot of dx_root before making dir indexed Syzbot reports a issue as follows ============================================ BUG unable to handle page fault for address ffffed11022e24fe PGD 23ffee067 P4D 23ffee067 PUD 0 Oops Oops 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN PTI CPU 0 PID 5079 Comm syz-executor306 Not tainted 6.10.0-rc5-g55027e689933 #0 Call Trace make_indexed_dir+0xdaf/0x13c0 fs/ext4/namei.c2341 ext4_add_entry+0x222a/0x25d0 fs/ext4/namei.c2451 ext4_rename fs/ext4/namei.c3936 [inline] ext4_rename2+0x26e5/0x4370 fs/ext4/namei.c4214 [...] ============================================ The immediate cause of this problem is that there is only one valid dentry for the block to be split during do_split, so split==0 results in out of bounds accesses to the map triggering the issue. do_split unsigned split dx_make_map count = 1 split = count/2 = 0 continued = hash2 == map[split - 1].hash ---> map[4294967295] The maximum length of a filename is 255 and the minimum block size is 1024, so it is always guaranteed that the number of entries is greater than or equal to 2 when do_split() is called. But syzbots crafted image has no dot and dotdot in dir, and the dentry distribution in dirblock is as follows bus dentry1 hole dentry2 free |xx--|xx-------------|...............|xx-------------|........

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `make_indexed_dir` function in the ext4 filesystem. This function converts a single-block unindexed directory to a three-block indexed directory. It assumes that the first two entries in the directory block are always "." (dot) and ".." (dotdot) entries. However, a crafted image can have a directory without these entries. When the function attempts to split the directory block, it can result in an out-of-bounds access to the map because it does not correctly calculate the number of valid entries due to the missing "." and "..".

Specifically, the issue occurs in the `dx_make_map` function called by the `do_split` function:

```
do_split
unsigned split
dx_make_map
count = 1
split = count/2 = 0;
continued = hash2 == map[split - 1].hash;
---> map[4294967295]
```

When `count` is 1, `split` becomes 0, leading to an attempt to access `map[-1]`, which is an out-of-bounds access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Assumption:** `make_indexed_dir` incorrectly assumes the existence of "." and ".." entries at the beginning of a directory block.
*   **Out-of-Bounds Access:**  The logic in `dx_make_map` allows for out-of-bounds access when `count` is equal to 1 which occurs when the first two entries in the directory block are not dot and dotdot entries.
*   **Lack of Sanity Checks:** There were no proper checks in place to verify the presence and validity of "." and ".." entries before proceeding with the directory indexing conversion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Kernel Panic:** The out-of-bounds access triggers a page fault leading to a kernel panic and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Filesystem Image:** An attacker can craft a malicious filesystem image where a directory lacks the "." and ".." entries, causing the vulnerability to trigger during rename operations or similar directory manipulations.
*  **Renaming Files:**  By renaming a file within a directory crafted in this way, it forces the directory to be indexed, triggering the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create a Malicious Filesystem:** The attacker must be able to create a custom filesystem image with a directory lacking "." and ".." entries.
*   **Ability to Mount the Filesystem:** The attacker would need to mount this crafted filesystem image to exploit this issue.
*   **File Operations:**  Operations like renaming a file in the crafted directory can trigger the vulnerability.

**Patch Information:**

The patch introduces `ext4_check_dx_root()` function which adds sanity checks for the dot and dotdot entries before converting the directory to an indexed one. It verifies the `name_len`, `name` and `rec_len` of the dot and dotdot entries, returning `-EFSCORRUPTED` if any of the checks fail, preventing the vulnerable code from being reached. The patch also ensures that the code does not assume the presence of `.` and `..` entries and handles the cases where they are missing.

This vulnerability is located in `fs/ext4/namei.c`.
