# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-21768

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net ipv6 fix **dst ref loops** in rpl, seg6 and ioam6 lwtunnels Some lwtunnels have a dst cache for post-transformation dst. If the packet destination did not change we may end up recording a reference to the lwtunnel in its own cache, and the lwtunnel state will never be freed. Discovered by the ioam6.sh test, kmemleak was recently fixed to catch per-cpu memory leaks. Im not sure if rpl and seg6 can actually hit this, but in principle I dont see why not.
