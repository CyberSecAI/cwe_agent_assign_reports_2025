The vulnerability is a **prototype pollution** issue, where an attacker can modify object prototype attributes. |\n| CWE-94 | Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') | 0.7 | Base | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary. The impact of the **prototype pollution** can lead to command injection. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **CWE-1321 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution'))**, which is a Variant-level CWE. This directly reflects the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions \"prototype pollution.\" The impact of this weakness can lead to **CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'))**, which is a Base-level CWE. **CWE-1321** could **CANPRECEDE** **CWE-94**, as the **prototype pollution** allows for the potential injection of code.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1321[\"CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe94 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe1321\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1321 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')** (**CWE-1321**), which allows an attacker to modify object prototypes. This, in turn, can lead to **Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')** (**CWE-94**) as a consequence of the modified prototypes. The chain highlights the progression from the initial weakness to the potential impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, particularly the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. The vulnerability is a **prototype pollution** issue (**CWE-1321**) that can lead to command injection (**CWE-94**).\n\nThe selection of **CWE-1321** is optimal because it directly addresses the root cause described in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The vulnerability description key phrases also explicitly mention \"**prototype pollution**\" as a **weakness**. The retriever results also ranked **CWE-1321** as the top candidate.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-94** is due to the impact of this vulnerability, which can lead to command injection.\n\nThe evidence is strong, and the relationships between the CWEs support the classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component that specifies attributes that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control modifications of attributes of the object prototype.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
