  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n*   **Root Cause:** The plugin fails to properly escape the `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` parameter before outputting it within an HTML attribute.\n*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the victim's browser, potentially leading to actions performed on behalf of the victim, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.\n*   **Attack Vector:** A crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript within the `REQUEST_URI` is used to trigger the vulnerability.\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n    *   The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL.\n    *   The victim must be a logged-in admin.\n    * The victim must be using a web browser that doesn't encode characters in URLs.\n    * The victim needs to click the link while logged into the WordPress admin panel.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is located in the `RSS Feed Widget` plugin, versions prior to 3.0.1.\n*   The provided proof of concept shows how to inject a script using a crafted URL. The payload `\"><script>alert(999)</script>` shows the injection.\n*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79, which is for improper neutralization of input during web page generation (Cross-site Scripting).\n*   The CVSS score is 4.2, with medium severity. The vector `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N` denotes:\n    *   Attack Vector (AV): Network\n    *   Attack Complexity (AC): High\n    *   Privileges Required (PR): None\n    *   User Interaction (UI): Required\n    *   Scope (S): Unchanged\n    *   Confidentiality Impact (C): Low\n    *   Integrity Impact (I): Low\n    *   Availability Impact (A): None",
