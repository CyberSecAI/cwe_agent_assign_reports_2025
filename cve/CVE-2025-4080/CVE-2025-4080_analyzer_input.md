  "Content": "Iandweb detected a critical SQL injection vulnerability in the \"/admin/view-request.php\" file of the \"Online Nurse Hiring System\" project, which is attributed to the insufficient validation of user input for the \"viewid (GET)\" parameter. Attackers can inject malicious SQL queries to access the database without proper authorization, modify/delete data, and obtain sensitive information.\n\n*   **Vulnerability location:** \"viewid (GET)\" parameter\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause lies in the fact that attackers can inject malicious code via the parameter \"viewid (GET)\". This input is then directly utilized in SQL queries without undergoing proper sanitization or validation processes.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Exploiting this SQL injection vulnerability allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to the database, cause sensitive data leakage, tamper with data, gain complete control over the system, and even disrupt services. This poses a severe threat to both the security of the system and the continuity of business operations.\n*   **Attack vector:** Attackers can inject malicious code via the parameter \"viewid (GET)\".\n*   **Vulnerability details and POC**\n    *   **Payload:** `viewid=1' AND (SELECT 9876 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))yrUq) AND 'AYZf'='AYZf`\n*   **Suggested repair:**\n    1.  Employ prepared statements and parameter binding.\n    2.  Conduct input validation and filtering.\n    3.  Minimize database user permissions."
