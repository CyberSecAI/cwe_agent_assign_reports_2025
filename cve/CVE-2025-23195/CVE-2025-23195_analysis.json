  "description": "An **XML External Entity (XXE)** vulnerability exists in the Ambari/Oozie project, allowing an attacker to inject malicious XML entities. This vulnerability occurs due to insecure parsing of XML input using the `DocumentBuilderFactory` class without disabling external entity resolution. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the server or perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks. The issue has been fixed in both Ambari 2.7.9 and the trunk branch.",

The **rootcause** is the insecure parsing of XML input using `DocumentBuilderFactory` without disabling external entity resolution. |\n| CWE-918 | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. An attacker can perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks, which is a potential impact of XXE injection. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the decision is the direct match of the vulnerability description to **CWE-611 (Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference)**. Additionally, **CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF))** is considered as a potential impact due to the attacker's ability to perform SSRF attacks.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe611[\"CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\"]\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    \n    cwe918 -- IMPACT --> cwe611\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe611 primary\n    class cwe918 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-611 (Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference)** due to the insecure parsing of XML input. This allows an attacker to inject malicious XML entities, leading to potential impacts such as reading arbitrary files and performing **CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF))** attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, including the vulnerability description and CVE reference links. The root cause is identified as the insecure parsing of XML input, leading to an **XML External Entity (XXE)** vulnerability. This directly corresponds to **CWE-611 (Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference)**, which is selected as the primary CWE. The potential for SSRF attacks is also noted, leading to the inclusion of **CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF))** as a secondary CWE. The selection of **CWE-611** is further supported by its high relevance score in the Retriever Results.
