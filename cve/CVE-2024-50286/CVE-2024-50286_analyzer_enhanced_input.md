## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ksmbd fix slab-**use-after-free** in ksmbd_smb2_session_create There is a **race condition** between ksmbd_smb2_session_create and ksmbd_expire_session. This patch add missing sessions_table_lock while adding/deleting session from global session table.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **race condition**
- **weakness:** **use-after-free**
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** ksmbd

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a race condition in the `ksmbd` (kernel SMB daemon) module. Specifically, a race exists between `ksmbd_smb2_session_create` (session creation) and `ksmbd_expire_session` (session expiration). This race condition can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Race Condition:** The core vulnerability is the race condition. Concurrent operations on the session table without proper locking can cause inconsistent state.
- **Use-After-Free:** If a session is expired by `ksmbd_expire_session` while `ksmbd_smb2_session_create` is still trying to access or create a session, it can lead to accessing freed memory, triggering a use-after-free.
- **Missing Lock:** The `sessions_table_lock` was missing when adding or deleting a session from the global session table.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Slab Use-After-Free:** Exploitation of this race condition can lead to a slab use-after-free.
- **Kernel Crash/DoS:** This can potentially result in a kernel crash or denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** Depending on how the corrupted memory is used, there is a potential for more severe outcomes such as privilege escalation, although the provided information does not specifically detail this.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The vulnerability can be triggered by network traffic directed to the `ksmbd` service. Specifically, triggering session creation and expiration concurrently.
- **SMB Protocol:** The attack vector involves sending SMB requests to the server that trigger the vulnerable code paths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the SMB server running `ksmbd`.
- **SMB Client:** The attacker needs to be able to send SMB protocol messages.
- **Ability to induce concurrent operations:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger session creation and expiration concurrently.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
- **Fix:** The provided patches address the issue by adding `sessions_table_lock` around operations where sessions are added and removed from the global session table in `user_session.c`. This ensures that access to the table is serialized, preventing the race condition.
- **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions v5.15 and later, according to the "Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org # v5.15+" line.
- **Reported and Tested By:** The vulnerability was reported and tested by Norbert Szetei of Doyensec.

In summary, this is a race condition leading to a use-after-free in the ksmbd module, which could be exploited by a remote attacker to crash the system by sending crafted SMB requests. The fix adds a lock to prevent concurrent modification of session tables.
