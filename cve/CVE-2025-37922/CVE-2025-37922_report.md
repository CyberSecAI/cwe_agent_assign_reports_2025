# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-37922

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved book3s64/radix Align section vmemmap start address to PAGE_SIZE A vmemmap altmap is a device-provided region used to provide backing storage for struct pages. For each namespace, the altmap should belong to that same namespace. If the namespaces are created unaligned, there is a chance that the section vmemmap start address could also be unaligned. If the section vmemmap start address is unaligned, the altmap page allocated from the current namespace might be used by the previous namespace also. During the free operation, since the altmap is shared between two namespaces, the previous namespace may detect that the page does not belong to its altmap and incorrectly assume that the page is a normal page. It then attempts to free the normal page, which leads to a kernel crash. Kernel attempted to read user page (18) - exploit attempt? (uid 0) BUG **Kernel NULL pointer dereference on read** at 0x00000018 Faulting instruction address 0xc000000000530c7c Oops Kernel access of bad area, sig 11

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis

The primary weakness is a **NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476)**, which can be triggered by a **missing initialization of a resource (CWE-909)** or an **out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)** that corrupts a pointer. CWE-476 is a child of CWE-754 (Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions), indicating a failure to validate the pointer before dereferencing it. CWE-909 is a class-level CWE, suggesting the possibility of a more specific base-level CWE describing the exact resource that wasn't initialized, but the information isn't there.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with a potential **missing initialization (CWE-909)** or an **out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)** leading to a **NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476)** and resulting in a kernel crash.

**CWE-909** *or* **CWE-787** --> **CWE-476** --> Kernel Crash

## Summary of Analysis

The analysis focuses on the root cause and the direct consequence of the vulnerability. The keyphrase "Kernel **NULL pointer dereference** on read" points directly to **CWE-476**. The description indicates a potential issue with namespace alignment and resource sharing, which might lead to the pointer being NULL.

The evidence for **CWE-476** is strong: "Kernel **NULL pointer dereference** on read at 0x00000018".

**CWE-909** is considered because the description mentions "If the namespaces are created unaligned, there is a chance that the section vmemmap start address could also be unaligned." This suggests a possible initialization issue.

**CWE-787** is also considered as a secondary weakness, as it is possible that the memory corruption may lead to an attacker overwriting the pointer to NULL.

The retriever results also support the selection of **CWE-476**. The relationships between the CWEs confirm that the chosen CWEs are relevant and contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability. The selection is based on the available evidence, focusing on the most direct cause and potential contributing factors.

Other CWEs considered but not used:

*   **CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'))**: While the vulnerability involves shared resources (altmap), there's no explicit mention of concurrent access or synchronization issues.
*   **CWE-923 (Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints)**: This CWE is not relevant as it deals with communication channels and endpoints, which is not the primary issue here.
*   **CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound)**: There's no indication of integer overflow or wraparound in the vulnerability description.
*   **CWE-822 (Untrusted Pointer Dereference)**: While a pointer is dereferenced, there's no mention of the pointer originating from an untrusted source.
*   **CWE-911 (Improper Update of Reference Count)**: No mention of reference counting issues.
*   **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)**: The vulnerability description highlights a NULL pointer dereference, not an out-of-bounds read.
*   **CWE-415 (Double Free)**: The description indicates a kernel crash due to an attempt to free a normal page, not a double free.
*   **CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime)**: While memory management is involved, the immediate cause is the NULL pointer dereference, not a memory leak.
