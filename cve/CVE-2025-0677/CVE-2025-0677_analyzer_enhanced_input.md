## Vulnerability Description
A flaw was found in grub2. When performing a symlink lookup, the grubs UFS module checks the inodes data size to allocate the internal buffer to read the file content, however, it fails to check if the symlink data size has overflown. When this occurs, grub_malloc() may be called with a smaller value than needed. When further reading the data from the disk into the buffer, the grub_ufs_lookup_symlink() function will write past the end of the allocated size. An attack can leverage this by crafting a malicious filesystem, and as a result, it will corrupt data stored in the heap, allowing for arbitrary code execution used to by-pass secure boot mechanisms.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **overflow of symlink data size**
- **weakness:** **buffer over-write**
- **impact:** arbitrary code execution
- **vector:** malicious filesystem
- **product:** grub2
- **component:** UFS module

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's the analysis of the provided content, focusing on CVE-2025-0677:

**1. Verification:**

*   The content from `access.redhat.com_c74bc20c_20250624_153207.html` contains a security advisory (RHSA-2025:6990) that references CVE-2025-0677.
*   The content from `bugzilla.redhat.com_353afffa_20250624_204801.html` directly mentions CVE-2025-0677 in the bug report.

**2. Relevant Content Extraction:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**  An integer overflow in the UFS module of GRUB. This occurs when checking the inode's data size during a symlink lookup. The module fails to validate the symlink data size, which can overflow.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows for a heap-based out-of-bounds write.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Data stored in the heap can be corrupted.  Arbitrary code execution may be achieved through it and to be used to by-pass secure boot mechanisms.
*   **Attack vectors:** Crafting a malicious filesystem.
*   **Mitigation or fix:**  The content from access.redhat.com/c74bc20c... indicates that the vulnerability has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 with the RHSA-2025:6990 security advisory.

**3. Content from bugzilla.redhat.com_353afffa_20250624_204801.html provides the same vulnerability information as in the Red Hat Security Advisory, but expands it by providing the following:**
