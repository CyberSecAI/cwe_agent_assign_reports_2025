  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-0520', description='A vulnerability in mlflow/mlflow version 8.2.1 allows for remote code execution due to **improper neutralization of special elements** used in an OS command (Command Injection) within the `mlflow.data.http_dataset_source.py` module. Specifically, when loading a dataset from a source URL with an HTTP scheme, the filename extracted from the `Content-Disposition` header or the URL path is used to generate the final file path without proper sanitization. This flaw enables an attacker to control the file path fully by utilizing **path traversal** or absolute path techniques, such as ../../tmp/poc.txt or /tmp/poc.txt, leading to arbitrary file write. Exploiting this vulnerability could allow a malicious user to execute commands on the vulnerable machine, potentially gaining access to data and model information. The issue is fixed in version 2.9.0.', key_phrases={'rootcause': ['improper input sanitization', 'improper neutralization of special elements'], 'weakness': ['command injection', 'path traversal'], 'impact': ['arbitrary file write', 'execute commands', 'remote code execution'], 'vector': '', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'mlflow/mlflow', 'version': '8.2.1', 'component': 'mlflow.data.http_dataset_source.py'}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed in the commit:\\n\\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\\n\\nThe vulnerability stems from the `HTTPDatasetSource` class in MLflow not properly sanitizing the filename provided in the `Content-Disposition` header of an HTTP response when downloading a dataset. If the header specifies a path instead of just a filename, this could lead to the downloaded file being placed outside the intended directory.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n\\n*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a potential path traversal issue. If the `Content-Disposition` header includes a path (e.g., `/foo/bar.txt` or `../foo/bar.txt`), the `HTTPDatasetSource` would use that directly as the filename. This could lead to writing downloaded data into arbitrary locations within the filesystem.\\n*  **Lack of Input Sanitization**: The code did not properly sanitize or validate the `filename` from the `Content-Disposition` header, allowing for injection of path components.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n\\n*   **Arbitrary File Write:** A malicious server could provide a `Content-Disposition` header with a path, leading the MLflow client to download the file to a user-controlled location.\\n*   **Potential for Overwriting Files:** Depending on the provided path and the MLflow client's execution environment, it could be possible to overwrite existing files in the system.\\n*   **Security Risks:** Successfully writing a file to an unexpected location could lead to several security risks, such as executing malicious code if a script is written or causing denial of service if important system files are overwritten.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n\\n*   A malicious or compromised HTTP server can craft a response with a malicious `Content-Disposition` header, which contains a file path rather than a simple file name.\\n*   The MLflow client, upon receiving this response, would extract the filename from the header, and if not validated would use it as a path for the downloaded file.\\n*   The user/MLflow client would attempt to download the dataset using `HTTPDatasetSource` from the malicious server.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n\\n*   The attacker must control or be able to manipulate the HTTP server that hosts the dataset that the MLflow client is attempting to download.\\n*   The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP responses including a malicious `Content-Disposition` header.\\n* No special capabilities on the user/client side are needed for exploitation. The user/client is simply requesting a resource using a vulnerable MLflow component.\\n\\n**Mitigation:**\\n\\nThe provided commit addresses this vulnerability by adding a check to ensure that the filename from the `Content-Disposition` header does not contain any path components. It uses a helper function `_is_path()` to verify this, and if a path is found, it will raise an error.\\nThe fix is implemented in the function `HTTPDatasetSource.load`, where `basename` is now validated using `_is_path` which will raise an exception if it is a path.\\nAdditionally, new tests were added to verify that the validation is effective and will raise an exception in the case of a malicious path injection.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}},

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    A vulnerability in mlflow/mlflow version 8.2.1 allows for remote code execution due to **improper neutralization of special elements** used in an OS command (Command Injection) within the `mlflow.data.http_dataset_source.py` module. Specifically, when loading a dataset from a source URL with an HTTP scheme, the filename extracted from the `Content-Disposition` header or the URL path is used to generate the final file path without proper sanitization. This flaw enables an attacker to control the file path fully by utilizing **path traversal** or absolute path techniques, such as ../../tmp/poc.txt or /tmp/poc.txt, leading to arbitrary file write. Exploiting this vulnerability could allow a malicious user to execute commands on the vulnerable machine, potentially gaining access to data and model information. The issue is fixed in version 2.9.0.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'improper input sanitization'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
