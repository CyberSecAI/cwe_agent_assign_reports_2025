  "description": "The MStore API Create Native Android & iOS Apps On The Cloud plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the status_type parameter in all versions up to, and including, 4.15.7 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-11179:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n- The vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw caused by insufficient sanitization and validation of the `status_type` parameter within the `flutter_get_reviews` function.\n- The code directly incorporates the unsanitized `status_type` parameter into an SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the direct insertion of user-supplied data into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterized queries.\n- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The plugin does not validate that the `status_type` parameter is one of the expected values.\n- **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The code uses `prepare` to prevent SQL injection, but not for the `status_filter`, as the `status_filter` is not treated as a parameter.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Data Breach:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the database. This could include user credentials, customer information, and other confidential data.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **HTTP Request Parameter:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code via the `status_type` parameter in an HTTP request to the vulnerable `flutter_get_reviews` function.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least \"Subscriber\" level access to the WordPress site to exploit the vulnerability.\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n-   The vulnerable code section is located within the `flutter_get_reviews` function in the file `vendor-admin-wcfm-helper.php`, specifically around line 833.\n-   The fix, implemented in version 4.15.8, includes input validation for `status_type` and order parameters around line 825 of `vendor-admin-wcfm-helper.php`.\n\nIn summary, CVE-2024-11179 is a critical SQL injection vulnerability that allows attackers with minimal privileges to access sensitive information by manipulating the `status_type` parameter. The patch introduces input validation to prevent such exploitation.",

The root cause is **insufficient escaping** leading to SQL injection. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of the vulnerability description to the CWE-89 specification. The vulnerability involves **insufficient escaping** of user-supplied input which leads to the construction of malicious SQL queries. CWE-89 is a base-level CWE which is preferred. No other relationships (parent-child, chain, peer) altered this assessment.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient escaping** of the `status_type` parameter. This leads to the ability to inject malicious SQL code, which then allows an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database. The chain is:\n1.  **Insufficient Escaping** (part of CWE-89)\n2.  **SQL Injection** (CWE-89)\n3.  **Information Disclosure** (Impact)\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-89, as it represents the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence. The vulnerability description clearly states that the root cause is **insufficient escaping** on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query, leading to **SQL injection**. The `CVE Reference Links Content Summary` section further supports this by detailing the **insufficient sanitization** and validation of the `status_type` parameter, allowing injection of arbitrary SQL code.\n\nThe Retriever Results also list CWE-89 as the top candidate, with a score of 1.0.\n\nThe selected CWE, CWE-89, is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as it directly represents the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n*Reason for not selecting:* This vulnerability is not related to CSRF.

This means that authorization exists but is bypassed due to the SQL injection, making CWE-862 less relevant.\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for not selecting:* This vulnerability is related to SQL injection, not Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).\n\n## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: class\n**Similarity Score**: 2.23\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis. It is also a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n\n*Reason for not selecting:* While **insufficient escaping** is a form of improper input validation, CWE-89 is a more specific and appropriate choice.",
