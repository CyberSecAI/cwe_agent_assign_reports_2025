  "cve_id": "CVE-2024-10988",
  "description": "A vulnerability was found in code-projects E-Health Care System 1.0. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /Doctor/doctor_login.php. The manipulation of the argument email leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Other parameters might be affected as well.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the lack of input sanitization and direct use of the `email` parameter in the `doctor_login.php` file within an SQL query.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection. The application fails to sanitize user-provided input (`email` parameter) before using it in an SQL query.\n- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application doesn't validate or sanitize user input, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Data Breach:** A successful SQL injection attack could allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information stored in the database.\n- **Login Bypass:** An attacker could bypass the login function using SQL injection techniques, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system.\n- **Database Manipulation:** Attackers might modify or delete data within the database.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP POST requests to the `doctor_login.php` endpoint.\n- **`email` Parameter:**  The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `email` parameter of the POST request.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.\n- **Understanding of SQL:** Knowledge of SQL syntax is required to craft malicious SQL injection payloads.\n- **No Authentication:** The vulnerability is in the login page, meaning no prior authentication is required to attempt exploitation.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrating how to use `sqlmap` to exploit the vulnerability and retrieve database information.\n- The vulnerable code is located in the `Doctor/doctor_login.php` file.\n- The application in question is the \"E-Health Care System\" which is available at `https://code-projects.org/e-health-care-system-in-php-css-js-and-mysql-free-download/`.",
