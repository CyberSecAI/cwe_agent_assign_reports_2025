  "description": "The User Registration - Custom Registration Form, Login Form, and User Profile WordPress Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a **missing capability check** on the import_form_action function in versions up to, and including, 3.2.0.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to import a registration form with a default user role of administrator. If an administrator approves or publishes a post or page with the shortcode to the imported form, any user can register as an administrator.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4958\n\n**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `import_form_action` function of the \"User Registration \u2013 Custom Registration Form, Login Form, and User Profile\" WordPress plugin. Specifically, there is a lack of capability verification before importing a form.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n*   **Missing Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of proper authorization checks before importing registration forms.\n*   **Privilege Escalation:**  An authenticated user with contributor-level permissions can import a registration form with a default user role of administrator.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Privilege Escalation:** A malicious user with contributor level or higher access can import a form with the default role as administrator.\n*   **Account Takeover:** Any user can register as an administrator if a post or page with the shortcode to the imported form is published or approved by an administrator.\n*   **Full Site Control:**  Gaining administrator access allows the attacker to take full control of the website.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network\n*   **Authentication:** Attacker requires a valid account with contributor level permissions or above on the target WordPress site.\n*   **User interaction:** The exploit requires the site administrator to publish a post/page with the shortcode of the imported form for a successful privilege escalation.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least contributor-level permissions.\n*   **Administrative Interaction**: The attacker requires that an administrator publishes or approves a page or post that contains the imported form shortcode.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerable function is `import_form_action` within the plugin.\n*   The fix includes adding capability checks to this function to ensure that only users with `manage_options` capability can perform the form import.\n*   The vulnerability affects versions up to and including 3.2.0.1 of the plugin.\n*   Version 3.2.1 of the plugin contains the fix.\n\nThis information provides more details than the generic CVE description which just states \"PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval\".",

Since the vulnerability description clearly states a **missing capability check**, CWE-862 is more appropriate than its siblings, which imply the existence of an authorization check that is either incorrect or improper. CWE-266 was also considered as a possible secondary weakness, as importing the registration form with a default user role of administrator could be seen as assigning incorrect privileges.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe266 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing capability check** (CWE-862) in the `import_form_action` function, which allows an attacker to import a registration form with a default user role of administrator. This leads to the potential **incorrect privilege assignment** (CWE-266), as users can register as administrators. This ultimately leads to privilege escalation and full site control.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **missing capability check** as the root cause, pointing towards an authorization issue. The retriever results also highlighted CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) as a strong candidate. After reviewing the CWE specifications and relationships, it became clear that CWE-862 is the most appropriate primary CWE, as it directly addresses the absence of an authorization check. The high confidence in this selection is due to the explicit mention of \"**missing capability check**\" in both the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is further supported by the MITRE mapping guidance, which suggests using CWE-862 when authorization logic is completely missing. Additionally, the CVE Reference Links Content Summary mentions that the fix includes adding capability checks to the vulnerable function, further reinforcing the relevance of CWE-862.\n\nCWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) was considered as a secondary weakness because the imported form allows users to register as administrators, which can be seen as an incorrect assignment of privileges.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
