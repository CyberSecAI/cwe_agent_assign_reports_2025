# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-4958

## Description

The User Registration - Custom Registration Form, Login Form, and User Profile WordPress Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a **missing capability check** on the import_form_action function in versions up to, and including, 3.2.0.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to import a registration form with a default user role of administrator. If an administrator approves or publishes a post or page with the shortcode to the imported form, any user can register as an administrator.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** missing capability check
- **Impact:** unauthorized modification of data
- **Attacker:** authenticated attackers
- **Product:** User Registration - Custom Registration Form, Login Form, and User Profile WordPress Plugin

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 1.0 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-266 | Incorrect Privilege Assignment | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the parent-child relationship between CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). Since the vulnerability description clearly states a **missing capability check**, CWE-862 is more appropriate than its siblings, which imply the existence of an authorization check that is either incorrect or improper. CWE-266 was also considered as a possible secondary weakness, as importing the registration form with a default user role of administrator could be seen as assigning incorrect privileges.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **missing capability check** (CWE-862) in the `import_form_action` function, which allows an attacker to import a registration form with a default user role of administrator. This leads to the potential **incorrect privilege assignment** (CWE-266), as users can register as administrators. This ultimately leads to privilege escalation and full site control.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified **missing capability check** as the root cause, pointing towards an authorization issue. The retriever results also highlighted CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) as a strong candidate. After reviewing the CWE specifications and relationships, it became clear that CWE-862 is the most appropriate primary CWE, as it directly addresses the absence of an authorization check. The high confidence in this selection is due to the explicit mention of "**missing capability check**" in both the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary.

The selection of CWE-862 is further supported by the MITRE mapping guidance, which suggests using CWE-862 when authorization logic is completely missing. Additionally, the CVE Reference Links Content Summary mentions that the fix includes adding capability checks to the vulnerable function, further reinforcing the relevance of CWE-862.

CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) was considered as a secondary weakness because the imported form allows users to register as administrators, which can be seen as an incorrect assignment of privileges.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
