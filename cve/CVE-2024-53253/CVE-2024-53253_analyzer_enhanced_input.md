## Vulnerability Description
Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Version 24.11.0, and only version 24.11.0, is vulnerable to a scenario where a specific error message generated by the Sentry platform could include a plaintext Client ID and Client Secret for an application integration. The Client ID and Client Secret would not be displayed in the UI, but would be returned in the underlying HTTP response to the end user. This could occur under the following conditions An app installation made use of a Search UI component with the `async` flag set to true (default true) auser types types into the Search Component which creates a request to the third-party for search or query results and that third-party response may then fail validation and Sentry would return the `select-requester.invalid-response` error code along with a serialized version of a Sentry application containing the integration Client Secret. Should this error be found, its reasonable to assume the potential exposure of an integration Client Secret. However, an ID and Secret pair alone does not provide direct access to any data. For that secret to be abused an attacker would also need to obtain a valid API token for a Sentry application. Sentry SaaS users do not need to take any action. For Sentry SaaS users, only a single application integration was impacted and the owner has rotated their Client Secret. No abuse of the leaked Client Secret has occurred. As of time of publication, a fix is available for users of Sentry self-hosted in pull request 81038. Sentry self-hosted does not ship with any application integrations. This could only impact self-hosted users that maintain their own integrations. In that case, search for a `select-requester.invalid-response` event. Please note that this error was also shared with another event unrelated to this advisory so Sentry self-hosted users will also need to review the parameters logged for each named event. Sentry self-hosted users may review `select_requester.py` for the instances where these errors can be generated. With the security fix this is no longer a shared event type. Sentry self-hosted users may not install version 24.11.0 and instead wait for the next release. Self-hosted instance that are already running the affected version may consider downgrading to to 24.10.0.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-53253:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper error handling in the Sentry application integration's `select-requester` component. Specifically, when a third-party API response failed validation, the system returned an error message that included the application integration's Client ID and Client Secret.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) within an error message. This is a violation of the principle of least privilege and secure handling of credentials.
*   **Improper Error Handling:** The system should not have included sensitive information in error messages, especially those returned in HTTP responses to end-users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Potential Unauthorized Access:** While the Client ID and Client Secret alone do not grant immediate access to data, they could be used to obtain a valid API token for the Sentry application by an attacker, potentially leading to unauthorized access, manipulation, or disclosure of data.
*   **SaaS User Impact:** For Sentry SaaS users, the impact was limited to a single application integration. The exposed secret was rotated, and no abuse was found.
*   **Self-Hosted User Impact:** For self-hosted users, the impact is dependent on whether they maintain custom integrations. They are advised to search for `select-requester.invalid-response` events in their logs.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exposed through HTTP responses, making it a network-based attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Interaction:** While no direct user interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability once the application is running, the attacker needs to interact with the affected component by typing into a search UI component that triggers the external request.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Component:** An attacker would need to know or discover that the specific `select-requester` component with the `async` flag enabled is vulnerable and craft input that triggers a validation failure.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in pull request [#79377](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/79377), which focused on improving logging and error handling for the `select-requester` component. The fix was implemented in pull request [#81038](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/81038).
*   The vulnerability is categorized as having a "Moderate" severity with a CVSS score of 5.3.

**Key takeaway**: The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of errors where sensitive credentials were included in the error response. While this alone does not allow for immediate unauthorized access to data, it creates a path for an attacker to obtain an API token that could be leveraged to compromise a Sentry application integration.
