This is incorrect because such devices have a single PHY.\\n- A prior commit (0335c034e726) introduced a dereference of the `phys` array using `wcid->phy_idx` in the `mt76_wcid_cleanup()` function.\\n- The incorrect `band_idx` assignment leads to an out-of-bounds access of the `dev->phys` array, since `phy_idx` is derived from `band_idx`.\\n\\n**Vulnerabilities:**\\n\\n- **Out-of-bounds read:** The `mt76_wcid_cleanup()` function attempts to access `dev->phys` using an invalid index (derived from the incorrect band_idx), leading to a kernel read from unreadable memory.\\n\\n**Impact:**\\n\\n- **Kernel crash/Oops:** The out-of-bounds read causes a kernel \"Oops\", resulting in a crash of the device. The system becomes unstable, potentially requiring a reboot to recover. This can lead to a denial of service.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n\\n- This isn\\'t directly an attack vector, but a bug that can be triggered by normal operation of the affected Wi-Fi devices.\\n- The vulnerability is triggered during the cleanup of a wireless connection, specifically in `mt76_wcid_cleanup()`.\\n- Operations that lead to disconnection of a WiFi client will trigger this bug.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n\\n- An attacker doesn\\'t need any special capabilities or position. The vulnerability is triggered by normal operations on affected mt7986 devices.\\n- The issue is a logic error in how the driver handles certain mt7986 hardware configurations.\\n- Simply connecting and disconnecting a wifi device is sufficient to trigger this bug.\\n\\n**Technical Details:**\\n\\n- The error occurs in `drivers/net/wireless/mediatek/mt76/mac80211.c` within the `mt76_wcid_cleanup()` function.\\n- The faulty code attempts to access `dev->phys[wcid->phy_idx]`.\\n- The fix replaces this with `mt76_dev_phy(dev, wcid->phy_idx)`, which properly maps `band_idx` to the correct phy for all hardware configurations.\\n- The crash occurs on systems using the mt7915 driver on devices like the ZyXEL EX5700 (Telenor) (DT)\\n- The backtrace clearly points to `mt76_wcid_cleanup` as the location where the crash occurs due to the invalid memory read.\\n- The vulnerability affects kernel versions including 5.15.150 as indicated by the logs',
