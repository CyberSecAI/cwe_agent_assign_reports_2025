The vulnerability description also mentions Stored XSS, suggesting a secondary weakness related to improper neutralization of input. This leads to the inclusion of CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] as a secondary weakness. There isn't a direct parent-child relationship between these two. CWE-352 does not have many direct relationships, while CWE-79 has several children relating to different forms of XSS.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability (CWE-352) which allows an attacker to force a user to perform unwanted actions. This action leads to Stored XSS (CWE-79) because the input isn't properly neutralized.\n\nCWE-352 (CSRF) -> CWE-79 (Stored XSS)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description and the provided CVE reference links. The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**Cross-Site Request Forgery** (CSRF) vulnerability in WP Map Plugins Interactive US Map allows Stored XSS.\" The CVE reference summary confirms that the **root cause** of the vulnerability is **Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] as the primary CWE is based on the explicit mention of CSRF as the **root cause** in the vulnerability description. The inclusion of CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] is due to the mention of \"Stored XSS\" in the description, indicating a failure to neutralize input properly.
