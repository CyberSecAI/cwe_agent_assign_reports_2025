# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2025-2185

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-613 | Insufficient Session Expiration | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of the vulnerability description to CWE-613, indicating **insufficient session expiration** as the root cause. CWE-319, related to the transmission of sensitive information in cleartext, was considered as a secondary CWE, representing the potential impact of the **insufficient session expiration**. The hierarchical relationships did not significantly influence the primary mapping, as CWE-613 is a base-level CWE that directly addresses the **root cause**.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient session expiration** (CWE-613), which leads to the transmission of passwords over unencrypted connections (CWE-319). The chain highlights how a weakness in session management can directly result in sensitive data being exposed.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based primarily on the vulnerability description provided, which explicitly states an **insufficient session expiration** vulnerability. The retriever results also strongly support CWE-613 as the primary CWE. The relationship graph emphasizes the connection between **insufficient session expiration** and the transmission of sensitive information in cleartext. CWE-613 is selected as the primary CWE because it accurately represents the **root cause** of the vulnerability, while CWE-319 is identified as the resulting impact.

The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
According to WASC, "Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization."

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
