### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** escalate privileges
- **vector:** crafted GET request
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** JimuReport
- **version:** v1.7.8
- **component:** /jeecg-boot/jmreport/dict/list

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `JimuReportTokenInterceptor` which is used for permission checks. The vulnerability is caused due to a flawed logic in the permission bypass check, specifically in the `preHandle` method of the interceptor. It checks for the `previousPage` parameter and a `shareToken`. If a `shareToken` is provided, it queries the database to see if that share token exists, and if it does not, the permission check is bypassed, and the user will be granted access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The core weakness is the ability to bypass the permission check by providing a non-existent `shareToken`.
- **Flawed Logic:** The logic incorrectly assumes that if a `shareToken` doesn't exist in the database, it is safe to allow access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An unauthenticated or unauthorized user can bypass the intended security restrictions and gain access to sensitive resources or functionalities by sending a request with a crafted `shareToken`. This enables access to protected endpoints like `/jeecg-boot/jmreport/dict/list`.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request that includes the `previousPage` parameter and an arbitrary value for the `shareToken`. The `JmReport-Share-Token` header is also included.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Basic understanding of HTTP Requests:** The attacker should know to set a parameter and header in a request.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists within the `org.jeecg.modules.jmreport.config.firewall.interceptor.JimuReportTokenInterceptor` class.
- The `preHandle` method first extracts the `previousPage` parameter from the request.
- Then, the code checks if `shareToken` exists, it then attempts to extract the `JmReport-Share-Token` from the request header. This token is then used in a query to the database via the `this.jimuReportShareDao.getShareByShareToken` function.
- The key vulnerability arises when the database query returns no results, the `preHandle` function incorrectly returns `true` allowing access to restricted resources.
- The proof of concept exploit is to send a GET request to `/jeecg-boot/jmreport/dict/list?previousPage=1&shareToken=` with the header `JmReport-Share-Token:123`.

The vulnerability is fixed in a later version of JimuReport, as mentioned in the comments by user `jeecgos`.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
