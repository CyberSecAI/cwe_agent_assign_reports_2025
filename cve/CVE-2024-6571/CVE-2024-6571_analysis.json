  "description": "The Optimize Images ALT Text (alt tag) & names for SEO using AI plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.1. This is due the plugin **utilizing cocur and not preventing direct access** to the generate-default.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.",

While CWE-200 is more of a symptom, the root cause of the vulnerability is the **missing authorization**, which allows an attacker to directly request and access the sensitive information (path disclosure). CWE-425 can lead to CWE-200, which forms a simple chain.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Design or Error\"]\n\n    cwe425 -->|CAN_PRECEDE| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe425 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing authorization** (CWE-425) on the `generate-default.php` file, which allows an unauthenticated user to directly access the file. This leads to the exposure of the full path of the web application (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **CWE-425** as the primary weakness due to the **lack of authorization** on the vulnerable file. This aligns with the root cause described in the vulnerability description: \"**utilizing cocur and not preventing direct access** to the generate-default.php file\". The retriever results also listed CWE-425 as a strong candidate. The evidence is strong, with the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary directly supporting the **missing authorization**. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-425 can directly lead to information exposure.\n\nThe CWEs considered but not used include:\n* CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function): While related, the vulnerability is more about missing authorization *after* a user might be authenticated (or not), rather than a complete lack of authentication.\n* CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data): This is more about how the information is sent, rather than the fact that it's accessible in the first place.\n* CWE-862 (Missing Authorization): This is a Class-level CWE, and CWE-425 is a more specific Base-level CWE, which is preferred.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
