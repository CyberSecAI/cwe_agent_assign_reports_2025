  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-6783', description='A vulnerability has been discovered in Vue, that allows an attacker to perform **XSS** via **prototype pollution**. The attacker could change the prototype chain of some properties such as `Object.prototype.staticClass` or `Object.prototype.staticStyle` to execute arbitrary JavaScript code.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'prototype pollution', 'weakness': ['XSS', 'cross-site scripting'], 'impact': 'execute arbitrary JavaScript code', 'vector': '', 'attacker': 'attacker', 'product': 'Vue', 'version': '', 'component': ''}, reference_content='Based on the provided content, here\\'s a breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**Root Cause:**\\n\\n- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization within the Vue 2 template compiler\\'s AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) codegen pathway. Specifically, the compiler doesn\\'t properly handle properties that are initially unset, leading to potential prototype pollution.\\n- The template compiler creates a string of code to be executed which turns component templates into render functions. These render functions are evaluated by Vue within a stringified eval statement.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\\n\\n- **Prototype Pollution:** An attacker can manipulate the prototype chain of `Object.prototype` properties, such as `staticClass` or `staticStyle`, due to missing checks for `hasOwnProperty` or explicit setting to `undefined` during AST node creation.\\n- **Client-Side XSS:** By polluting the prototype, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser when a vulnerable component is rendered.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n\\n- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code within the context of the victim\\'s browser. This can lead to various impacts, such as:\\n    - Data theft (accessing cookies, local storage, session data)\\n    - Session hijacking\\n    - Redirecting users to malicious sites\\n    - Defacing the website\\n    - Performing actions on behalf of the user\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n\\n- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the network.\\n- **In-browser template compilation:** The vulnerability is present in the in-browser Vue template compiler, which is responsible for creating render functions from string templates.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n\\n- **Low Privileges:** The attacker does not need high privileges to exploit this vulnerability.\\n- **Ability to influence template compilation:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the content of a Vue template in a way that will trigger the vulnerable code path. This could be through direct manipulation of the template string or by controlling the data that is used to populate the template.\\n- **No user interaction:** This vulnerability does not require user interaction.\\n\\n**Additional Details:**\\n\\n- The vulnerability is present in the \"full build\" of Vue 2, which includes the in-browser template compiler.\\n- The `staticClass` property is vulnerable when a template string uses the `class` attribute with a non-dynamic class.\\n- The issue is related to how properties of `ASTElement` are handled during codegen.\\n- The vulnerability is considered to be of \"Medium\" severity.\\n\\n**Affected Versions:**\\n\\n- Vue versions >= 2.0.0 and < 3.0.0.\\n\\n**Patched Versions:**\\n\\n- This vulnerability is fixed in Vue 3.0.0 and later.\\n- HeroDevs also provides a patched version for Vue 2 called \"Vue 2 NES\" in versions v2.6.17 and v2.7.19.\\n\\nThe provided content gives a good overview of the vulnerability, its root cause, how it can be exploited, and its impact. It also provides specific technical details, such as the vulnerable properties and code examples to reproduce it.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '1321', 'name': \"Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product receives input from an upstream component that specifies attributes that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control modifications of attributes of the object prototype.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:prototype pollution', 'keyphrase': 'prototype pollution', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:execute arbitrary JavaScript code', 'keyphrase': 'execute arbitrary JavaScript code', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'attacker:attacker', 'keyphrase': 'attacker', 'type': 'attacker'}, {'id': 'product:Vue', 'keyphrase': 'Vue', 'type': 'product'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(565.3215025645275)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '1188', 'name': 'Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:prototype pollution', 'keyphrase': 'prototype pollution', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:execute arbitrary JavaScript code', 'keyphrase': 'execute arbitrary JavaScript code', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'attacker:attacker', 'keyphrase': 'attacker', 'type': 'attacker'}, {'id': 'product:Vue', 'keyphrase': 'Vue', 'type': 'product'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(300.9273540250434)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '843', 'name': \"Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:prototype pollution', 'keyphrase': 'prototype pollution', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:execute arbitrary JavaScript code', 'keyphrase': 'execute arbitrary JavaScript code', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'attacker:attacker', 'keyphrase': 'attacker', 'type': 'attacker'}, {'id': 'product:Vue', 'keyphrase': 'Vue', 'type': 'product'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(277.66694716168575)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(276.39878477993204)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '80', 'name': 'Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(251.9022840955235)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '335', 'name': 'Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) but does not correctly manage seeds.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:prototype pollution', 'keyphrase': 'prototype pollution', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'attacker:attacker', 'keyphrase': 'attacker', 'type': 'attacker'}, {'id': 'product:Vue', 'keyphrase': 'Vue', 'type': 'product'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(247.93399662565201)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
