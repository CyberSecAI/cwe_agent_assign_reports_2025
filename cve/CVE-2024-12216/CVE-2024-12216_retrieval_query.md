# Retrieval Query for CVE-2024-12216

# Vulnerability Description

    A vulnerability in the `ImageClassificationDataset.from_csv()` API of the `dmlc/gluon-cv` repository, version 0.10.0, allows for arbitrary file write. The function downloads and extracts `tar.gz` files from URLs without proper sanitization, making it susceptible to a **TarSlip** vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by crafting malicious tar files that, when extracted, can overwrite files on the victims system via **path traversal** or faked symlinks.

    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'lack of proper sanitization'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') (Score: 417.76)

The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource....

### 2. CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements (Score: 408.44)

The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component....

The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location th...

### 5. CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal (Score: 391.98)

The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory....
