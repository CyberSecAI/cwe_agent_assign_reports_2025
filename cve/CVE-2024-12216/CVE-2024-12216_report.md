# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-12216

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-12216

## Description

A vulnerability in the `ImageClassificationDataset.from_csv()` API of the `dmlc/gluon-cv` repository, version 0.10.0, allows for arbitrary file write. The function downloads and extracts `tar.gz` files from URLs without proper sanitization, making it susceptible to a **TarSlip** vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by crafting malicious tar files that, when extracted, can overwrite files on the victims system via **path traversal** or faked symlinks.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Impact:** ['arbitrary file write', 'overwrite files']
- **Vector:** malicious tar files
- **Attacker:** attackers
- **Product:** gluon-cv
- **Version:** 0.10.0
- **Component:** ImageClassificationDataset.from_csv() API

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-59 | Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**. This is because the vulnerability involves crafting malicious tar files that, when extracted, can overwrite files on the victim's system due to **path traversal**. **CWE-22** directly addresses this issue where external input is used to construct a pathname without proper sanitization, allowing it to resolve outside the restricted directory. **CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')** is a secondary concern because the crafted tar files can also include faked symlinks, which when extracted, can lead to writing files to unintended locations. **CWE-59** addresses the issue where the product does not properly prevent a filename from identifying a link that resolves to an unintended resource.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper sanitization** of the `tar.gz` files extracted from URLs, which leads to a **TarSlip** vulnerability and the possibility of **path traversal** or the use of faked symlinks. This results in **arbitrary file write** and the ability to **overwrite files** on the victim's system.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the vulnerability description, focusing on the **root cause** which is the **lack of proper sanitization** and the resulting **path traversal** and symlink exploitation. The primary CWE is **CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** because it directly addresses the **path traversal** aspect of the vulnerability. The secondary CWE is **CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')**, representing the potential exploitation of symlinks.

The evidence supporting this decision comes directly from the vulnerability description: "The function downloads and extracts `tar.gz` files from URLs without **proper sanitization**, making it susceptible to a **TarSlip** vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by crafting malicious tar files that, when extracted, can overwrite files on the victims system via **path traversal** or faked symlinks."

Both **CWE-22** and **CWE-59** are at the Base level of abstraction, which is appropriate for this vulnerability.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.



## CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere. This could allow an attacker to cause the product to operate on unauthorized files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.



## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
