## Vulnerability Description
All the Toshiba printers contain a shell script using the same hardcoded key to encrypt logs. An attacker can decrypt the encrypted files using the hardcoded key. This vulnerability can be executed in combination with other vulnerabilities and difficult to execute alone. So, the CVSS score for this vulnerability alone is lower than the score listed in the Base Score of this vulnerability. For detail on related other vulnerabilities, please ask to the below contact point. https//www.toshibatec.com/contacts/products/ As for the affected products/models/versions, see the reference URL.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

  "summary": "The vulnerability is due to the use of hardcoded credentials within the firmware of Toshiba and Oki Electric Industry MFPs. Specifically, a hardcoded password is used to encrypt logs, with a weak digest cipher. An attacker with access to the affected product could obtain sensitive information, including the ability to decrypt encrypted log files.  Additionally, there is a vulnerability to bypass authentication mechanism by uploading a .htaccess file."
