  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-11171', description='In danny-avila/librechat version git 0c2a583, there is an improper **input validation vulnerability**. The application uses multer middleware for handling multipart file uploads. When using in-memory storage (the default setting for multer), there is no limit on the upload file size. This can lead to a server crash due to **out-of-memory errors** when handling large files. An attacker without any privileges can exploit this vulnerability to cause a complete denial of service. The issue is fixed in version 0.7.6.', key_phrases={'rootcause': ['input validation vulnerability', 'improper input validation'], 'weakness': 'out-of-memory errors', 'impact': ['denial of service', 'server crash'], 'vector': 'multipart file uploads', 'attacker': 'attacker without any privileges', 'product': 'danny-avila/librechat', 'version': 'git 0c2a583', 'component': 'multer middleware'}, reference_content=\"The content relates to a fix in the LibreChat project addressing avatar upload handling. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\nThe original code used `multer` to handle file uploads, reading the file buffer directly. This approach was refactored to use `fs` (file system) for reading the file and to enhance file validation.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\nThe original code lacked sufficient file validation and potentially had issues with how file data was handled, potentially leading to vulnerabilities related to file size, type, or malicious content. The commit message indicates a refactoring to address these concerns.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\nThe impact isn't explicitly stated, but insufficient file validation could lead to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks (e.g., uploading excessively large files), or potentially allow malicious users to upload and execute arbitrary code if the uploaded files were processed insecurely.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n*   Uploading large files to exhaust server resources.\\n*   Uploading files with unexpected content or types.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\nAn attacker would need to be able to upload files to the server (e.g., a registered user or someone with write access to the upload endpoint).\\n\\n**Mitigation or fix:**\\n*   Refactored avatar upload handling to use `fs` for file reading.\\n*   Enhanced file validation, including checking file size against a configurable limit (`fileSizeLimit` or `avatarSizeLimit`) and verifying the file type against a list of supported MIME types (`supportedMimeTypes`).\\n*   Added specific size limit for avatar uploads.\\n*   Improved error messages to indicate the endpoint or avatar upload when file size limits are exceeded.\\n\\n**More detail than official CVE description:**\\nYes, this content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It outlines the specific code changes made to address the vulnerability, including the use of `fs` and the enhanced file validation logic. It also details the specific parameters used in the validation process (file size limits, MIME types).\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds':

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    In danny-avila/librechat version git 0c2a583, there is an improper **input validation vulnerability**. The application uses multer middleware for handling multipart file uploads. When using in-memory storage (the default setting for multer), there is no limit on the upload file size. This can lead to a server crash due to **out-of-memory errors** when handling large files. An attacker without any privileges can exploit this vulnerability to cause a complete denial of service. The issue is fixed in version 0.7.6.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'input validation vulnerability'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
