# Retrieval Query for CVE-2025-22092

# Vulnerability Description

    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved PCI Fix **NULL dereference** in SR-IOV VF creation error path Clean up when virtfn setup fails to prevent NULL pointer dereference during device removal. The kernel oops below occurred due to **incorrect error handling** flow when pci_setup_device() fails. Add pci_iov_scan_device(), which handles virtfn allocation and setup and cleans up if pci_setup_device() fails, so pci_iov_add_virtfn() doesnt need to call pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device(). This prevents accessing partially initialized virtfn devices during removal.

    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis
    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. 
    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.

    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'NULL dereference'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-690: Unchecked Return Value to NULL Pointer Dereference (Score: 365.00)

The product does not check for an error after calling a function that can return with a NULL pointer if the function fails, which leads to a resultant NULL pointer dereference....

### 2. CWE-665: Improper Initialization (Score: 361.38)

The product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used....

### 3. CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value (Score: 347.88)

The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions....

### 4. CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference (Score: 347.20)

The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL....

### 5. CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource (Score: 339.59)

The product does not initialize a critical resource....

## ROOTCAUSE: 'incorrect error handling'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-833: Deadlock (Score: 350.01)

The product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock....

### 2. CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value (Score: 347.88)

The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions....

### 3. CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference (Score: 347.20)

The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL....

### 4. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 339.73)

The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently....
