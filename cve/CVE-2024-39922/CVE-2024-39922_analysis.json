However, these were deemed less relevant as the vulnerability involves storing user passwords in plaintext rather than using hard-coded credentials. The relationship between CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) and its potential base-level children was also considered, but CWE-312 and CWE-256 were more specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    \n    cwe256 -->|PEEROF| cwe312\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe256 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward: the application **stores user passwords in plaintext** (CWE-312 & CWE-256), which allows a physical attacker to retrieve the passwords from the embedded storage (Impact). The root cause is the **insecure storage** of the passwords.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core issue: the **plaintext storage** of user passwords. This is directly supported by the vulnerability description, which states the device \"**store user passwords in plaintext** without proper protection\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms this, stating, \"The root cause is the **plaintext storage** of user-set passwords\".\n\nCWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is the most appropriate primary CWE because it precisely describes the vulnerability. The retriever results also ranked CWE-312 highly. The evidence is strong, and the mapping guidance allows its use.\n\nCWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) can also be considered as a secondary CWE since the vulnerability explicitly refers to passwords.\n\nThe other CWEs considered from the retriever results were not as relevant. For example, CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) and its children (CWE-259, CWE-321) were considered but rejected as the vulnerability does not involve hard-coded credentials. Instead, it concerns the storage of user-set passwords without encryption.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Explanation:**\nCWE-312 is highly relevant. The vulnerability description clearly states that the device **stores user passwords in plaintext**. This CWE perfectly captures this weakness.\n\n## CWE-256: Use of Hard-coded Password\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 2.61\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a hard-coded password, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-656\n- PEEROF -> CWE-257\n- PEEROF -> CWE-321\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-798\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-798\n\n**Explanation:**\nCWE-256: This CWE addresses hardcoded passwords, not plaintext storage. It is related to CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials), but the vulnerability here involves user-set passwords, not hardcoded ones. Therefore, it is less applicable than CWE-312.\n\n## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 2.60\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nThe use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-656\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-798\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-798\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-798\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-321\n\n**Explanation:**\nCWE-321: This CWE addresses hardcoded cryptographic keys, not plaintext storage. It is related to CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials), but the vulnerability here involves user-set passwords, not hardcoded keys. Therefore, it is not applicable.\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Explanation:**\nCWE-798 is not the primary weakness. The passwords are not hard-coded. The vulnerability is in the way the user-defined passwords are being stored.\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Explanation:**\nCWE-522 is less specific than CWE-312. While the credentials are \"insufficiently protected\", the core issue is that they are stored in plaintext. CWE-312 is a better fit.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n\n**Explanation:**\nCWE-311 is more generic than CWE-312. The vulnerability specifically involves plaintext storage, making CWE-312 the more accurate choice.",

Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:\n\n```\n\t\tInbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.\n\t\tOutbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.\n```\nIn the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\n\nThe Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\n",
