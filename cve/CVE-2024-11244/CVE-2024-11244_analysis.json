  "description": "A vulnerability classified as critical was found in code-projects Farmacia 1.0. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file /editar-cliente.php. The manipulation of the argument id leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection\n\n**Root Cause:** The `editar-cliente.php` file in the `farmacia-in-php` project directly concatenates the `$id` parameter into a SQL query without any sanitization or prepared statements.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- Unsanitized user input: The `$id` parameter from the GET request is directly used in the SQL query.\n- SQL Injection: By manipulating the `$id` parameter, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Unauthorized database access: An attacker can potentially access sensitive data from the database.\n- Arbitrary command execution: Through SQL injection, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary commands on the database server.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability can be exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to `editar-cliente.php` with a malicious value for the `id` parameter.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- Network access to the vulnerable application.\n- Ability to craft HTTP requests.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) showing a sample HTTP GET request with a modified `id` parameter (`id=1*`) to demonstrate the SQL injection.\n- The vulnerable code is in the `editar-cliente.php` file of the `farmacia-in-php` application.\n\nThe provided information gives more details than a placeholder CVE description and accurately describes a SQL injection vulnerability.",
