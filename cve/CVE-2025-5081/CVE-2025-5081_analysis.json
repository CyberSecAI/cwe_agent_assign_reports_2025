  "description": "A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Campcodes Cybercafe Management System 1.0. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file /adminprofile.php. The manipulation of the argument mobilenumber leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Other parameters might be affected as well.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the content provided, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:\n\n**Relevant Content:**\n\n*   **Vulnerability:** SQL injection vulnerability in the '/adminprofile.php' file.\n*   **Affected Product:** Cybercafe Management System V1.0\n*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient user input validation of the 'mobilenumber' parameter, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL queries.\n*   **Impact:** Attackers can achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and service interruption.\n*   **Attack Vector:** Exploitation via the 'mobilenumber' parameter using a POST request.\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable '/adminprofile.php' file.\n*   **Payload:** The content provides a specific payload: `adminname=Admin&username=admin&mobilenumber=8979555556' AND (SELECT 3410 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))etde) AND 'eNKi'='eNKi&email=admin@gmail.com&submit=`\n*   **POC**: The content provides an example of how to use sqlmap tool to exploit the vulnerability.\n*   **Suggested Repair:**\n    1.  Use prepared statements and parameter binding\n    2.  Input validation and filtering\n    3.  Minimize database user permissions\n    4.  Regular security audits.\n\n**More Detail than Official CVE Description:** The content provides a specific vulnerable file, parameter, attack vector, POC, and detailed mitigation steps. The content also has a screenshot of a successful attack.",

The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation leading to SQL injection. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship impacting the decision is the direct match between the vulnerability description and the definition of CWE-89. The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**sql injection**\" due to manipulation of the 'mobilenumber' argument, which aligns directly with CWE-89's focus on improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command. Other CWEs were considered, but none matched as closely as CWE-89.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of the following:\n1.  **Root Cause:** Insufficient input validation of the 'mobilenumber' parameter.\n2.  **Weakness:** CWE-89 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection').\n3.  **Impact:** Unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and service interruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the clear evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The vulnerability is explicitly identified as an SQL injection vulnerability affecting the 'mobilenumber' parameter in the '/adminprofile.php' file. The provided evidence includes the attack vector (manipulation of the 'mobilenumber' argument), the root cause (**insufficient user input validation**), and the potential impact (unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, etc.). This evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-89 as the primary CWE. The retriever results also list CWE-89 as the top candidate with a score of 1.0. The suggested repair in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary mentions prepared statements, parameter binding, and input validation which are all mitigations for SQL Injection. The relationships of other CWEs were considered, but none were as directly applicable as CWE-89. CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\nCWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')): While input neutralization is a general concept, the specific vulnerability involves SQL injection, making CWE-89 a more precise match.\n*   CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')): Similar to CWE-79, this is a broader category. SQL injection is a more specific type of injection.\n*   CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')): This CWE is specific to OS command injection, which is not the case here.\n*   CWE-96 (Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')): Not applicable because the injection is not into statically saved code.\n*   CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')): Not applicable because the vulnerability isn't about bypassing authorization checks.\n*   CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine): Not applicable because the injection is not in a template engine.\n*   CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type): Not applicable because the vulnerability is not related to file uploads.\n*   CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output): While encoding/escaping could be a potential mitigation, the core issue is the lack of proper input validation allowing SQL injection.",
