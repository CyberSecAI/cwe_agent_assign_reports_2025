## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of input, leading to **OS command injection**.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description explicitly states that the manipulation of the argument `param` leads to **command injection**. The best fit for this is CWE-78, "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')", as it is a specific type of **command injection** related to operating system commands. The retriever results also list CWE-78 as a high contender.

Other CWEs considered:

*   CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') - While this is a parent of CWE-78, CWE-78 is more specific and thus a better fit.
*   CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') - This is specific to SQL commands, which is not indicated in the vulnerability description.
*   CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') - This is related to web page generation and XSS, not command injection.
*   CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine - This is specific to template engines, which is not indicated in the vulnerability description.
*   CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type - This relates to file uploads, not command injection via parameter manipulation.
