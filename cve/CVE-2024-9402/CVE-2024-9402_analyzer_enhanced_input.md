## Vulnerability Description
**Memory safety bugs** present in Firefox 130, Firefox ESR 128.2, and Thunderbird 128.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of **memory corruption** and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 131, Firefox ESR < 128.3, Thunderbird < 128.3, and Thunderbird < 131.
