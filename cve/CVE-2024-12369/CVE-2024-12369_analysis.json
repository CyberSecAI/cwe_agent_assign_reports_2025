  "description": "A vulnerability was found in OIDC-Client. When using the RH SSO OIDC adapter with EAP 7.x or when using the elytron-oidc-client subsystem with EAP 8.x, **authorization code injection** attacks can occur, allowing an attacker to inject a stolen authorization code into the attackers own session with the client with a victims identity. This is usually done with a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) or phishing attack.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-12369:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a flaw in the way the `elytron-oidc-client` handles authorization codes during the OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication process. Specifically, the client does not adequately verify or protect against the substitution of authorization codes.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Authorization Code Injection:** An attacker can inject a stolen authorization code into their own authentication flow.\n- **Lack of Sufficient Validation:** The client does not properly validate the origin or legitimacy of the authorization code, allowing it to be swapped with a stolen one.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Identity Spoofing:** An attacker can hijack a legitimate user's session by injecting their stolen authorization code, effectively assuming the victim's identity within the application.\n- **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker can gain access to the application with the victim's privileges.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker could intercept the authorization code during a legitimate user's authentication flow.\n- **Phishing:** An attacker could trick a user into providing their authorization code through a phishing attack.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Code Acquisition:** The attacker needs to obtain a valid authorization code from a legitimate user's authentication process.\n- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept or modify the request/response flow during authentication.\n- **Active Session:** The attacker needs to initiate the login flow to inject the code during authentication.\n- **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of the authentication flow and the vulnerability itself to inject the code properly.\n\n**Additional Technical Details:**\n- The vulnerability affects Red Hat SSO OIDC adapter with EAP 7.x and `elytron-oidc-client` subsystem with EAP 8.x.\n- The attacker replaces a newly generated authorization code with the stolen one during the authorization exchange.\n- The OIDC provider performs its checks successfully and issue tokens associated with the victim to the attacker.",

CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) was chosen as the most specific root cause, residing at the Base level. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) were considered as related but less specific classifications. The relationships clarified whether the issue stemmed from a complete lack of authentication or a flaw in the authorization process after authentication.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of authorization codes**, leading to **authorization bypass** and ultimately resulting in **identity spoofing**.\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper validation** of authorization codes allowing injection (CWE-639).\n2.  **Weakness:** An attacker injects a stolen authorization code.\n3.  **Impact:** The attacker gains unauthorized access with the victim's identity, leading to potential data breaches and other security compromises.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **lack of proper validation of authorization codes**. The analysis heavily relies on the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, specifically the statement: \"The client does not properly validate the origin or legitimacy of the authorization code, allowing it to be swapped with a stolen one.\" This directly supports the selection of CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key).\n\nThe relationship analysis helped refine the selection by considering alternative CWEs related to authentication and authorization. While CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was considered, it was deemed less appropriate since the vulnerability involves bypassing existing authorization mechanisms rather than a complete lack of authentication. CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) is a higher-level classification, making CWE-639 a more precise fit.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity.
