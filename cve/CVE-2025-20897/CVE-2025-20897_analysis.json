While the vulnerability description points to an access control issue, it lacks the specificity to determine whether it's due to missing authentication, missing authorization, or incorrect authorization.

The retriever results also pointed towards CWEs related to access control and authorization. However, a closer look revealed that the description lacks specific details to differentiate between authentication and authorization issues.\n\nThe decision to use CWE-284 is primarily based on the high-level nature of the vulnerability description. The description mentions \"**Improper access control**\" but does not elaborate on whether the issue is related to missing authentication, missing authorization, or incorrect authorization. The \"**Root cause of vulnerability: Improper access control**\" from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this.\n\nGiven this lack of specificity, selecting a more specific CWE like CWE-862 or CWE-306 would be inappropriate. Therefore, CWE-284, which represents a general access control issue, is the most suitable choice based on the available evidence.",
