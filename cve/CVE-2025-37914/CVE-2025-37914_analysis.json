  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net_sched ets Fix double list add in class with netem as child qdisc As described in Gerrards report [1], there are use cases where a netem child qdisc will make the parent qdiscs enqueue callback reentrant. In the case of ets, there wont be a UAF, but the code will add the same classifier to the list twice, which will cause **memory corruption**. In addition to checking for qlen being zero, this patch checks whether the class was already added to the active_list (cl_is_active) before doing the addition to cater for the reentrant case.

The vulnerability leads to memory corruption due to writing data beyond the intended buffer boundary.|\n| CWE-362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability is triggered by reentrant enqueue callbacks due to a race condition.|\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write, which results from the **memory corruption** caused by adding the same classifier to the list twice. A secondary contributing factor is CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'), as the reentrant enqueue callbacks that trigger the double addition are a form of race condition.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe362 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a race condition (CWE-362), leading to a double addition of a classifier to the list. This double addition causes **memory corruption**, resulting in an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**memory corruption**\" caused by the double addition leading to writing data beyond the buffer. The fact that this happens in a re-entrant context suggests a race condition.\n\nThe description states: \"In the case of ets, there wont be a UAF, but the code will add the same classifier to the list twice, which will cause **memory corruption**.\"\n\nCWE-362 is included as a secondary factor as the reentrant enqueue callbacks leading to the double addition are indicative of a race condition.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-787 is a base level CWE and accurately describes the **memory corruption** caused by writing data outside of the buffer. CWE-362 is a class level CWE and captures the essence of the race condition leading to the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs multiple related behaviors, but the behaviors are performed in the wrong order in ways which may produce resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize a critical resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
