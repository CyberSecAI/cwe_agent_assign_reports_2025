## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
I will implement the CVE description retrieval.
I am unable to retrieve the CVE description at this time.

The content from github.com_75280c2f_20250624_124532.html is relevant to the CVE.
Here's the extracted information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `daemon` process in Yi IOT XY-3820 cameras lacks proper input validation.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the `daemon` process on port 6789 and `/usr/bin/cmd` binary on port 999.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Allows remote attackers to execute scripts, potentially causing Denial of Service (DoS) or exposing additional ports for further exploitation, and allows attackers to gain `root` access and execute arbitrary commands, leading to full device compromise.
*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   Remote, via TCP port 6789.
    *   Remote, via TCP port 999.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote attacker with network access to the Yi IOT XY-3820 camera.
*   **Mitigation or fix**:
    *   Restrict Network Access: Block incoming traffic on ports 6789 and 999 using a firewall.
    *   Isolate Affected Devices: Place affected cameras on a separate VLAN.
    *   Monitor Network Traffic: Review network logs for unusual activity.
    *   No official patch is available.
