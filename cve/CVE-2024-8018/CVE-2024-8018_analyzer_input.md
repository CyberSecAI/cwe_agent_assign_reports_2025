# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-8018

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in imartinez/privategpt version 0.5.0 allows for a Denial of Service (DOS) attack. When uploading a file, if an attacker appends a large number of characters to the end of a multipart boundary, the system will continuously process these characters, rendering privateGPT inaccessible. This **uncontrolled resource consumption** can lead to prolonged unavailability of the service, disrupting operations and causing potential data inaccessibility and loss of productivity.
