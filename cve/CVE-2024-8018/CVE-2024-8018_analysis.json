  "description": "A vulnerability in imartinez/privategpt version 0.5.0 allows for a Denial of Service (DOS) attack. When uploading a file, if an attacker appends a large number of characters to the end of a multipart boundary, the system will continuously process these characters, rendering privateGPT inaccessible. This **uncontrolled resource consumption** can lead to prolonged unavailability of the service, disrupting operations and causing potential data inaccessibility and loss of productivity.",

While it is generally discouraged to map to Class-level CWEs when more specific Base or Variant level CWEs are available, in this case, the description focuses on the general exhaustion of resources without specifying a particular type of resource. CWE-770 is a child of CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime) and sibling to other resource management CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime\"]\n\n    cwe400 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the attacker providing a malformed input (multipart boundary with excessive characters). The system **fails to properly control the consumption of resources**, leading to the **Denial of Service**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states \"**uncontrolled resource consumption**,\" making CWE-400 the most appropriate primary CWE. The vulnerability involves a Denial of Service due to the continuous processing of excessive characters appended to a multipart boundary during file upload.\n\nCWE-400 is a Class-level CWE, and the mapping guidance suggests it's often misused and conflated with the technical impact. However, in this instance, the root cause is directly related to the lack of control over resource consumption, making it a reasonable choice, although usually discouraged.\n\nCWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is a potential secondary CWE, as it describes a scenario where the product allocates resources without imposing restrictions. While this is a possible contributing factor, the primary issue is the **uncontrolled consumption** of resources regardless of allocation method.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is strong, with the key phrase \"**uncontrolled resource consumption**\" directly pointing to CWE-400. The retriever results also support this choice, with CWE-400 being the top-ranked CWE.\n\nThe decision is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and supported by retriever results. While CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE, it accurately reflects the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs.
