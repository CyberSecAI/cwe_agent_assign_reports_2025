Physical access to the device or the device's network is not required.\n\nThe document also provides the following details which are not explicitly stated in the standard CVE description:\n\n*   **Affected Product:** goTenna Pro ATAK Plugin versions 1.9.12 and prior.\n*   **CVSS v3.1 Score:** 4.3 (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)\n*   **CVSS v4 Score:** 5.3 (CVSS4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)\n*   **Mitigation:** Sharing the encryption key via a local QR code is advised for higher security, and users are encouraged to update to v2.0.7 or greater.\n\nThe document also provides mitigations for all vulnerabilities:\n*   Use discreet callsigns and key names.\n*   Secure end-user devices with encryption and regular updates.\n*   Follow key rotation best practices.\n*   Use QR codes for secure key exchange.\n*   Secure broadcasting environments by transmitting keys at reduced power.\n*   Leverage layered encryption for communications.",

The encryption key name is transmitted without encryption. |\n| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. Sending the key name can be considered insertion of sensitive information into sent data. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-319, which directly addresses the **cleartext transmission of sensitive information**. CWE-201, *Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data*, is a related CWE that describes the broader issue of including sensitive information in transmitted data. While CWE-319 is more specific, CWE-201 provides a broader context.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    \n    cwe319 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe201\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** of sending the encryption key name unencrypted. This leads directly to the impact of an attacker being able to capture the key name and potentially gain information about the encryption in use.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the **root cause** that the \"encryption key name is sent unencrypted when the key is broadcasted over RF.\" This directly aligns with CWE-319, *Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information*. The CVE reference summary also indicates \"Weakness: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data (CWE-201)\". Therefore, both CWE-319 and CWE-201 are relevant.
