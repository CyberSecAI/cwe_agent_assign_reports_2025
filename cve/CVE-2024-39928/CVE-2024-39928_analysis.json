This can then lead to unauthorized access or other security breaches.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence that the vulnerability lies in the **insecure random string generation** within Apache Linkis. The root cause is the **use of Commons Lang's RandomStringUtils** for generating tokens, leading to predictable random strings.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-337, as it directly addresses the use of a predictable seed in a pseudo-random number generator. This is supported by the vulnerability description, which mentions the use of `RandomStringUtils`, implying a predictable seed or algorithm. The CWE is at the Variant level, which is the most specific level applicable based on the available information.\n\nCWE-330 was considered as a more general case (\"Use of Insufficiently Random Values\"), but CWE-337 is more specific and thus more appropriate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
