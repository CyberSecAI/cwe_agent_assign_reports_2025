  "description": "The Blogmentor - Blog Layouts for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the pagination_style parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.5 due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4623\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `pagination_style` parameter within the Blogmentor plugin.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into a page. When a user accesses this page, the malicious script will execute in their browser. This could lead to various attacks such as:\n    - Stealing session cookies\n    - Redirecting users to malicious sites\n    - Defacing the website\n    - Performing actions on behalf of the user\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The `pagination_style` parameter, when modified, is not properly sanitized, allowing for injection of malicious scripts.\n- The injected script is stored in the database and rendered on the front end of the website, executing when a page with the vulnerable widget is loaded.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to have at least \"contributor\" level access to the WordPress site. This implies the attacker must have an account on the target site with specific privileges.\n- The attacker needs to be able to modify or create a page that uses the vulnerable Blogmentor widget.",

CWE-79 is a Base level CWE which is optimal. CWE-116 is a class level, so less specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n\n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe116\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe116 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**, which directly leads to the possibility of injecting arbitrary web scripts, resulting in Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).\n\nRoot Cause: **Insufficient Input Sanitization and Output Escaping**\nWeakness: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\nImpact: Arbitrary web script injection and execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Blogmentor plugin for WordPress. The root cause is **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** of the `pagination_style` parameter. This allows authenticated attackers with contributor-level access and above to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-79, which directly addresses the core issue of improper neutralization of input during web page generation, leading to cross-site scripting. The evidence is clearly stated in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section: \"**rootcause:** **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**\" and \"**weakness:** **cross-site scripting**\".\n\nThe secondary CWE is CWE-116, as the **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** falls under the umbrella of improper encoding or escaping of output. While CWE-79 is more specific, CWE-116 highlights the underlying technical flaw.\n\nThe Retriever Results also suggest CWE-79 as a strong candidate, with a high score.
