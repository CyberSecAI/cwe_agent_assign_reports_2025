## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4623

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `pagination_style` parameter within the Blogmentor plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into a page. When a user accesses this page, the malicious script will execute in their browser. This could lead to various attacks such as:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The `pagination_style` parameter, when modified, is not properly sanitized, allowing for injection of malicious scripts.
- The injected script is stored in the database and rendered on the front end of the website, executing when a page with the vulnerable widget is loaded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have at least "contributor" level access to the WordPress site. This implies the attacker must have an account on the target site with specific privileges.
- The attacker needs to be able to modify or create a page that uses the vulnerable Blogmentor widget.
