# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-47945

## Vulnerability Description
The devices are vulnerable to session hijacking due to insufficient entropy in its session ID generation algorithm. The session IDs are predictable, with only 32,768 possible values per user, which allows attackers to pre-generate valid session IDs, leading to unauthorized access to user sessions. This is not only due to the use of an (insecure) rand() function call but also because of missing initialization via srand(). As a result only the PIDs are effectively used as seed.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient entropy in session ID generation algorithm**
- **impact:** session hijacking
- **vector:** predictable session IDs
- **attacker:** attackers

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-47945:

**Root Cause:** The root cause of this vulnerability is the predictable session ID generation algorithm used by the Rittal IoT Interface and CMC III Processing Unit.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insufficient Entropy:** The session ID generation relies on the `rand()` function, which has a limited number of possible values (2^31).
*   **Missing `srand()` Initialization:** The `rand()` function is not properly initialized using `srand()`, causing it to always return the same value on the first call in the `json.cgi` script.
*   **Limited Seed:** The seed used to generate the session ID is based on a combination of the process ID (PID) and the output of `rand()`. Since the initial rand() call is ineffective the PID effectively becomes the only seed.
*   **Low Number of Possible Session IDs:** Due to the above issues, the session ID effectively has a very low entropy, with only 32,768 possible values per user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can predict valid session IDs, allowing them to hijack existing user sessions.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** By hijacking a session, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the device's web interface and its functionalities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The attack is performed over the network, targeting the web interface.
*   **Online Brute-Force:** An attacker can perform an online brute-force attack by trying pre-calculated session IDs until a valid session is taken over.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the device over the network.
*   **Web Interface Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the login page of the web interface, which is normally protected by authentication.
*   **Knowledge of UserID:** The attacker needs to know or guess the UserID of the target user (e.g., admin = 0, user = 1) to generate valid session IDs, however this will be known for default user accounts.
*   **Active User Session:** A valid session needs to be active for the brute-force attack to succeed.

**Additional details:**

* The vulnerability affects versions prior to 6.21.00.2 of the Rittal IoT Interface and CMC III Processing Unit.
* The vulnerable function is located in the `json.cgi` script used by the web server.
* The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) code demonstrates how to generate a list of predictable session IDs and perform an online brute-force attack.
