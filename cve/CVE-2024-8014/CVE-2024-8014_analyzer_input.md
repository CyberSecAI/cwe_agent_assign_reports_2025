## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure type resolution vulnerability. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the use of externally controlled input to select classes or code, leading to unsafe reflection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-470, Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection'). This allows for object injection via insecure type resolution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary code by exploiting the insecure type resolution vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors:** Object injection through insecure type resolution. The vulnerability is triggered by providing specially crafted input that can influence type resolution in an unsafe manner.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply input that affects the type resolution process. The exact method of providing this input might vary depending on how Telerik Reporting is integrated into an application.
