CWE-79 [CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] is the secondary CWE because it describes the specific vulnerability that is enabled by the **lack of CSRF protection**.\n\nThe retriever results support these choices, listing CWE-352 [CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] and CWE-79 [CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] as top candidates.
