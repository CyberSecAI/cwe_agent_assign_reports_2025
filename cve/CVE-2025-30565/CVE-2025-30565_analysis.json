This allows an attacker to induce a user to perform unwanted actions. The secondary weakness is CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')], because the CSRF allows for Stored XSS via the higher privileged user.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe79 -->|CAUSED_BY| cwe352\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]**, where the application **fails to validate the origin of requests**. This allows an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user, leading to **CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]** and resulting in Stored XSS. The root cause is the **missing CSRF protection**, which then enables the XSS vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference. The description highlights a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability leading to Stored XSS in the karrikas banner-manager plugin.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)], with a confidence score of 0.9, because the root cause of the vulnerability is the **lack of CSRF protection**. This allows an attacker to induce an authenticated user to perform actions, such as modifying settings to inject malicious scripts.\n\nThe secondary CWE is CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')], with a confidence score of 0.8, because the impact described is Stored XSS, which is **caused by the lack of CSRF protection**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity. CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] directly addresses the **root cause**, and CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] describes the resulting XSS.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:",
