# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-45163

## Vulnerability Description
The Mirai botnet through 2024-08-19 **mishandles simultaneous TCP connections** to the CNC (command and control) server. Unauthenticated sessions remain open, causing resource consumption. For example, an attacker can send a recognized username (such as root), or can send arbitrary data.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **mishandles simultaneous TCP connections**
- **impact:** Unauthenticated sessions remain open and resource consumption
- **vector:** recognized username or arbitrary data
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Mirai botnet
- **component:** CNC (command and control) server

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45163:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **improper session management** in the Mirai botnet's Command and Control (CNC) server.
*   Specifically, the CNC server fails to handle a large number of concurrent connection attempts adequately, particularly during the pre-authentication phase.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Concurrent Connection Management:** The server does not limit or properly manage multiple simultaneous connection requests.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The server's session buffer can be overwhelmed by a large number of connection attempts, leading to resource exhaustion and a crash.
*   **Lack of Rate Limiting:** There is no rate limiting on incoming connections for the pre-authentication phase.
*   **Lack of Pre-Authentication Timeouts:** Connections in the pre-authentication state are not timed out if input is not provided.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can remotely crash the CNC server, rendering it inoperable.
*   **Disruption of Botnet Operations:** The botnet's command and control functionalities are incapacitated, disrupting its ability to launch attacks.
*   **Potential Disruption of Ethical Testing:**  Controlled botnet environments used for stress testing can be disrupted and lead to incomplete tests and other issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network, requiring no local access to the CNC server.
*   **Simple Authentication Request:** The attacker sends a simple authentication request with a username (e.g., 'root') to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network access to the CNC server.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The attacker does not need any valid credentials or prior access to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to Send Network Traffic:** The attacker needs to be able to send TCP connection requests and send a username string.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the Mirai botnet source code and its variants.
*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) script in pastebin demonstrates how an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by opening many concurrent connections.
*   The blog post suggests multiple remediation methods, such as limiting concurrent connections, implementing rate limiting, and setting pre-authentication session timeouts.
