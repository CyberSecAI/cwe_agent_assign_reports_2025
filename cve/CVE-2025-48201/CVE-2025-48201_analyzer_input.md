## Analysis of CVE-2025-48201 Content

This content **IS RELATED** to CVE-2025-48201. It provides detailed information about a security advisory for the "Backup Plus" (ns\_backup) TYPO3 extension.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The extension fails to sanitize user input, leading to Command Injection when creating backups.
*   The extension saves backup and configuration files to a predictable resource location.
*   The extension fails to properly encode user input for output in HTML context in the TYPO3 backend user interface.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Command Injection (CWE-77)
*   Predictable Resource Location (CWE-552)
*   Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79)

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Command Injection:** An authenticated backend user with access to the extension's backend module could execute arbitrary commands.
*   **Predictable Resource Location:** An unauthenticated remote user could download created backups and configuration files.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:**  The advisory states the extension fails to properly encode user input for output in HTML context in TYPO3 backend user interface.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Command Injection:** Creating a backup with malicious input.
*   **Predictable Resource Location:** Accessing the predictable file storage location via HTTP.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Triggering the vulnerable code in the TYPO3 backend.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Command Injection:** Authenticated backend user with access to the extension's backend module.
*   **Predictable Resource Location:** No authentication required (unauthenticated remote user).
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Access to the TYPO3 backend.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Update to version 13.0.1 or later of the "Backup Plus" (ns\_backup) extension.
*   Download and remove all previously created backup files.
*   Configure a non-publicly accessible directory as the target folder for backups.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   **Affected Versions:** 13.0.0 and below
