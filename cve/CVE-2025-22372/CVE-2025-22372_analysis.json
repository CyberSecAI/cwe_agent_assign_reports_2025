This leads to potential password recovery by unauthorized actors, resulting in a security breach.\n  - **Root Cause**: **Insufficiently Protected Credentials** (CWE-522)\n  - **Weakness**: Plaintext Storage or Reversible Encryption (CWE-256, CWE-257)\n  - **Impact**: Password Recovery and Potential Unauthorized Access\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the limited evidence available in the vulnerability description. The primary indicator is the phrase \"**Insufficiently Protected Credentials**\" and the storage of passwords in plaintext or using reversible encryption. While the evidence is not extensive (\"Evidence Strength: LOW\"), the description aligns well with CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) as a high-level classification. Specific child CWEs like CWE-256, CWE-257, and CWE-312, considered because they provide more detail on the exact mechanism. The hierarchical relationships guided the decision to select CWE-522 as the primary, with the others as potential contributing factors.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users.
