It provides more detail than the official CVE description (which is currently a placeholder).\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the ability of an unauthenticated remote attacker to access information about running processes via the SNMP protocol. The amount of data returned can trigger a reboot via the watchdog timer.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   An unauthenticated attacker can access information about running processes.\n*   Sending SNMP read commands can trigger a reboot of the device.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Remote, unauthenticated access via the SNMP protocol.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   No authentication required.\n*   Network access to the device.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Ensure only authorized personnel have access to the gateway.\n*   Only use the gateway in an isolated network environment.\n*   **Remediation:** Install updated firmware V1.3.13.\n\n**CVSS Score:** 8.2 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H)",

The excessive data returned by the SNMP service leads to uncontrolled resource consumption, ultimately causing a reboot. CWE-400 is related to CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling), which is a more specific Base level CWE, but the description of CWE-400 is a closer fit.\n- CWE-200 is a Class level CWE related to information disclosure.
