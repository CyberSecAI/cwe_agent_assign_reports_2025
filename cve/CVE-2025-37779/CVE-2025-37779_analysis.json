  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved lib/iov_iter fix to increase non slab folio refcount When testing EROFS file-backed mount over v9fs on qemu, I encountered a folio UAF issue. The page sanity check reports the following call trace. The root cause is that **pages in bvec are coalesced across a folio bounary**. The refcount of all non-slab folios should be increased to ensure p9_releas_pages can put them correctly.

While CWE-667 and CWE-362 were considered due to the potential for concurrency issues, the core problem is the **use after free** condition.
