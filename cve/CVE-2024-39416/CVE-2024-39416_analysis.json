CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a peer of CWE-285. CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) is related to authorization bypass. The abstraction levels guided the selection of CWE-285 as a Class, with the consideration of more specific base-level CWEs where applicable.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe285 -- PeerOf --> cwe863\n    cwe639 --> cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **Improper Authorization vulnerability** (CWE-285), leading to a Security feature bypass. A low-privileged attacker can exploit this to disclose minor information. The root cause is the **improper authorization**, and the impact is the security feature bypass.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the vulnerability description that explicitly mentions \"**Improper Authorization vulnerability**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating \"**Root Cause: Improper Authorization (CWE-285)**\". The retriever results also list CWE-285 as a candidate.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-285 is a class-level CWE, and there might be more specific base-level CWEs. The CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is considered because it's a peer of CWE-285 and represents a slightly more specific scenario where authorization checks are performed incorrectly.

CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a peer of CWE-285. CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) is related to authorization bypass. The abstraction levels guided the selection of CWE-285 as a Class, with the consideration of more specific base-level CWEs where applicable.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe285 -- PeerOf --> cwe863\n    cwe639 --> cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **Improper Authorization vulnerability** (CWE-285), leading to a Security feature bypass. A low-privileged attacker can exploit this to disclose minor information. The root cause is the **improper authorization**, and the impact is the security feature bypass.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the vulnerability description that explicitly mentions \"**Improper Authorization vulnerability**\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating \"**Root Cause: Improper Authorization (CWE-285)**\". The retriever results also list CWE-285 as a candidate.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-285 is a class-level CWE, and there might be more specific base-level CWEs. The CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is considered because it's a peer of CWE-285 and represents a slightly more specific scenario where authorization checks are performed incorrectly. CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) is also a possibility if the authorization bypass is happening through a user-controlled key.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity based on the available evidence.
