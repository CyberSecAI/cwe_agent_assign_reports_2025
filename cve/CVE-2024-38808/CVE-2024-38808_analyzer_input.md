# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-38808

## Vulnerability Description
In Spring Framework versions 5.3.0 - 5.3.38 and older unsupported versions, it is possible for a user to provide a specially crafted Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expression that may cause a **denial of service (DoS)** condition. Specifically, an application is vulnerable when the following is true * The application evaluates user-supplied SpEL expressions.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **denial of service (DoS)**
- **impact:** denial of service
- **vector:** specially crafted Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expression
- **attacker:** user
- **product:** Spring Framework
- **version:** 5.3.0 - 5.3.38 and older unsupported versions

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-38808:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the Spring Framework's handling of Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expressions. Specifically, it occurs when an application evaluates user-supplied SpEL expressions without proper safeguards.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsafe SpEL Evaluation:** The core issue is the evaluation of user-provided SpEL expressions, which allows an attacker to inject malicious code or expressions that can lead to a denial of service (DoS).
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The vulnerability exists because the application does not properly sanitize or restrict the SpEL expressions provided by users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can cause a denial of service, rendering the application unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User-Supplied SpEL Expressions:** Attackers can inject specially crafted SpEL expressions through user-controlled input fields or other means where SpEL evaluation is performed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Supply SpEL:** Attackers need to be able to supply or influence the SpEL expressions that the vulnerable application will evaluate. This could happen through various input points exposed by the application.
*  **No special privileges required:** The attacker does not require any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The affected versions of Spring Framework are 5.3.0 to 5.3.38, as well as older, unsupported versions.
*   The vulnerability is rated as medium severity with a CVSS score of 4.3.
*   NetApp products that incorporate the vulnerable Spring Framework are also affected.
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by upgrading to Spring Framework version 5.3.39 or later, or version 6.0+. It is also recommended to avoid user-supplied SpEL expressions when possible, and to use a read-only `SimpleEvaluationContext` if user input must be evaluated.
