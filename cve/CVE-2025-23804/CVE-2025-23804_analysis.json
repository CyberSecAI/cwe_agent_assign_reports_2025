Independently, there is a separate **XSS** vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis identified two distinct vulnerabilities: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) due to **missing CSRF protection**, and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The primary focus is on CWE-352 because the description explicitly mentions CSRF and the **rootcause** of the issue being **missing CSRF protection**.
