This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Kofax Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JP2 files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-22021.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'lack of proper validation of user-supplied data', 'weakness': ['Information Disclosure Vulnerability', 'Out-Of-Bounds Read'], 'impact': ['disclose sensitive information', 'execute arbitrary code', 'information disclosure'], 'vector': 'malicious page or file', 'attacker': 'remote attackers', 'product': 'Kofax Power PDF', 'version': '', 'component': 'JP2 File Parsing'}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5512:\\n\\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\\n- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing JP2 files in Kofax Power PDF. This insufficient validation leads to an out-of-bounds read.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n- **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the software attempts to read data beyond the allocated memory region for the JP2 file being parsed.\\n- **Lack of Input Validation:** The software fails to adequately validate the data within the JP2 file, allowing the possibility of triggering the out-of-bounds read.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information by causing the application to read from memory locations that should not be accessible.\\n- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** The advisory indicates that an attacker could leverage this vulnerability in combination with other vulnerabilities to potentially achieve arbitrary code execution.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- **Malicious JP2 File:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious JP2 file that, when opened by Kofax Power PDF, triggers the out-of-bounds read.\\n- **Malicious Web Page:** The advisory also mentions that user interaction is needed, as the target must visit a malicious web page or open a malicious file, suggesting that this attack can also be launched by having users visit a malicious web page.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- **User Interaction:** The attacker requires user interaction, specifically that the target user must open a malicious JP2 file or visit a malicious web page.\\n- **Ability to Craft Malicious Input:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a specially designed JP2 file that exploits the parsing flaw.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {95: {'cwe_counts':

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    Kofax Power PDF JP2 File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Kofax Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JP2 files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-22021.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'lack of proper validation of user-supplied data'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
