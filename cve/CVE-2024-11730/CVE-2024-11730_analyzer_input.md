# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-11730

## Vulnerability Description
The KiviCare Clinic & Patient Management System (EHR) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the sort[] parameter of the static_data_list AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.4 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with doctor/receptionist-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**
- **weakness:** **SQL injection**
- **impact:** extract sensitive information from the database and information disclosure
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers
- **product:** KiviCare Clinic & Patient Management System (EHR) plugin for WordPress
- **version:** up to and including 3.6.4
- **component:** static_data_list AJAX action

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11730

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization on the `sort[]` parameter within the `static_data_list` AJAX action. The parameter is not properly escaped before being used in an SQL query, and existing SQL queries lack adequate preparation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is an SQL injection vulnerability. The unsanitized `sort[]` parameter allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize the `sort[]` parameter before using it in an SQL query.
- **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The existing SQL query does not use prepared statements, which would prevent SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to extract sensitive information from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via the `static_data_list` AJAX action.
- The `sort[]` parameter is the attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** Attackers must be authenticated users with at least doctor/receptionist-level access (or higher) to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the WordPress site to send the malicious request.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists in versions of the KiviCare â€“ Clinic & Patient Management System (EHR) WordPress plugin up to and including 3.6.4.
- The fix was implemented in version 3.6.5 by utilizing `sanitize_sql_orderby` to sanitize the `field` and `type` values before concatenating them to the `ORDER BY` clause.
- The Wordfence article mentions that the vulnerability is caused by "insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query."
