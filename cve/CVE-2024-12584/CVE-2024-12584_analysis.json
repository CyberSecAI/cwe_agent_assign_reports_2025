While CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE, it accurately captures the **sensitive information exposure**. CWE-862, Missing Authorization, is a potential root cause, indicating a **missing** security check. These are related as CWE-862 could CanPrecede CWE-200, meaning that a missing authorization check can lead to the exposure of sensitive information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing authorization** check (CWE-862). This **missing** check allows authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access and above to use the \"duplicate function\" to extract sensitive data from draft, scheduled, private, and password-protected posts, ultimately leading to **sensitive information exposure** (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the core weakness described in the vulnerability. The description clearly indicates a **sensitive information exposure** through the \"duplicate function\" of the plugin. The retriever results pointed to CWE-200, Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor, as a strong candidate. The description also mentions that authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access and above can extract sensitive data, suggesting a potential **missing** or **incorrect authorization** mechanism.\n\nThe primary decision to map CWE-200 is based on the explicit mention of \"Sensitive Information Exposure\" in the vulnerability description and key phrases.\n\nThe decision to include CWE-862 is based on the fact that the vulnerability allows authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access to extract data they should not have access to. This implies a **missing authorization** check.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n*Not Used:* This CWE does not fit the vulnerability description because there is no evidence of CSRF.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* While related to authorization, the description doesn't specify that the vulnerability is due to accessing restricted URLs or files.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* There's no mention of externally controlled parameters in the description.\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* The description does not involve file uploads.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* The description doesn't explicitly mention user-controlled keys.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
