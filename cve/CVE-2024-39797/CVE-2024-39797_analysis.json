The description indicates a general access control issue. |\n| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.6 | Class | Secondary Candidate | Allowed-with-Review. Considered because the issue could be related to incorrect authorization logic. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-284, which is a high-level category for **Improper Access Control**. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a child of CWE-284 and represents a more specific case where the authorization logic is flawed. The decision to use CWE-284 as primary is based on the initial vulnerability description, which points to a general access control issue without specifying the exact nature of the flaw in authorization. If more details were available about the specific authorization checks being performed incorrectly, then CWE-863 would be a more suitable primary CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper access control** (CWE-284) which leads to a potential denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis and selection of CWEs are based on the vulnerability description that highlights **\"Improper access control\"** as the main issue leading to a potential denial of service. The provided evidence from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this.\n\nThe retriever results also point to CWE-284 **Improper Access Control**, although the retriever score isn't the highest, the keyword matches the root cause analysis.\n\nThe selection of CWE-284 is at a higher level (Pillar) of abstraction because the specific details of how the access control is improperly implemented are not provided in the description.
