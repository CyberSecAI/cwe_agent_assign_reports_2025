# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-8743

## Vulnerability Description
The Bit File Manager - 100% Free & Open Source File Manager and Code Editor for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Limited JavaScript File Upload in all versions up to, and including, 6.5.7. This is due to a **lack of proper checks on allowed file types**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and granted permissions by an administrator, to upload .css and .js files, which could lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **lack of proper checks on allowed file types**
- **weakness:** **cross-site scripting**
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers
- **product:** Bit File Manager - 100% Free & Open Source File Manager and Code Editor for WordPress
- **version:** up to and including 6.5.7

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8743

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper checks on allowed file types when uploading files via the "Bit File Manager" plugin. Specifically, the plugin does not adequately restrict the upload of potentially harmful file types.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The plugin allows the upload of `.css` and `.js` files, which are executable in a web browser context.
- **Insufficient File Type Validation:**  The plugin fails to properly validate and restrict file uploads based on their MIME types.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By uploading malicious `.js` or `.css` files, attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the website, leading to XSS attacks. This allows attackers to execute malicious scripts in the browsers of other users who visit the affected pages.
- **Potential for Further Compromise:** Successful exploitation of XSS can be leveraged to perform various malicious actions, potentially leading to further compromise of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload Functionality:** Attackers exploit the file upload feature of the plugin.
- **MIME Type Bypass:** The plugin fails to adequately validate file uploads based on their MIME types, allowing attackers to bypass any existing restrictions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "Subscriber"-level access.
- **Permissions:** The attacker needs to have the necessary file management permissions granted by an administrator.
- **Access to File Manager Functionality**: The user must have access to the file upload feature within the plugin.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability was present in versions up to and including 6.5.7 of the "Bit File Manager" plugin.
- Version 6.5.8 of the plugin includes a fix for this issue.
- The fix includes restricting javascript and css file types for shortcodes and allows the admin to allow from permission settings if required.
- The plugin developers have updated the plugin to address this vulnerability which involves changes in `FileManagerController.php`, `PermissionsController.php` and `PermissionsProvider.php` to add  `javascript`, `css` to the list of allowed file types to be managed by admin.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.8 which is medium.
- The Wordfence vulnerability database provides detailed information about the vulnerability including a link to the plugin's changeset that addresses it, and links to CVE.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| “Escalate to root/admin”                    | Privilege escalation impact           | Not CWE-269! Use root cause (e.g., 266, 250) |
| “Assigned wrong role/group”                 | Misassigned privilege                 | CWE-266                                      |

| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
