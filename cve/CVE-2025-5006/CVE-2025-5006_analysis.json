Here's the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n* A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the '/admin/category.php' file of the 'Online Shopping Portal' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter 'category' and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n* SQL injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n* Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n* The '/admin/category.php' file is vulnerable via the 'category' parameter.\n* No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*  Ability to craft and send malicious SQL queries via the 'category' parameter. No authentication needed.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n* Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n* Input validation and filtering.\n* Minimize database user permissions.\n* Regular security audits.\n\n**Additional details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n* **Vulnerable File:** /admin/category.php\n* **VERSION(S):** V1.0\n* **Payload Example:** `category=22' AND (SELECT 3351 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))mipV) AND 'iBvL'='iBvL&description=22&submit=`\n* **Software Link:** <https://www.campcodes.com/downloads/complete-online-shopping-portal-using-php-and-mysql-source-code/?wpdmdl=5515&ind=0>\n* **Vendor Homepage:** <https://www.campcodes.com/projects/complete-online-shopping-portal-using-php-and-mysql-free-download/>\n* **Submitter:** sl9r7an",
