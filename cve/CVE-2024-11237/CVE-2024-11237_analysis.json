  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in TP-Link VN020 F3v(T) TT_V6.2.1021. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the component DHCP DISCOVER Packet Parser. The manipulation of the argument hostname leads to **stack-based buffer overflow**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-11237:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is a combination of flaws in how the TP-Link VN020 F3v(T) router handles DHCP DISCOVER packets, specifically:\n\n*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:**  The router's DHCP server allocates a fixed-size buffer (64 bytes) on the stack for storing the hostname from the DHCP DISCOVER packet. By sending a hostname longer than this (127 bytes in the exploit), a stack-based buffer overflow occurs.\n*   **DHCP Option Length Manipulation:** The router does not properly validate the length fields in DHCP options, allowing an attacker to specify a length larger than the actual data provided. This can lead to memory corruption when the router tries to read more data than available.\n*   **Vendor-Specific Option Parsing:** An edge case in the parsing of vendor-specific options, specifically using the TP-Link vendor prefix followed by 0xFF bytes, triggers a parser state confusion which contributes to the memory corruption.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** A classic buffer overflow on the stack due to insufficient bounds checking when handling DHCP hostnames.\n*   **Improper Input Validation:** The DHCP server fails to properly validate the length of data in DHCP options, leading to out-of-bounds reads and writes.\n*   **Lack of Robust DHCP Packet Parsing:** The combination of different vulnerabilities in DHCP packet parsing leads to exploitable memory corruption.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Confirmed impact is that the router becomes unresponsive, the DHCP service fails, and the device automatically restarts causing network disruption and requiring manual intervention.\n*  **Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The vulnerability has the potential for RCE, although this is not definitively confirmed in the provided details. The stack overflow could be used to overwrite the return address which, if done correctly, could lead to remote code execution.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Remote:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely through network traffic.\n*   **DHCP DISCOVER Packets:** The attack vector involves sending specially crafted DHCP DISCOVER packets to the router's DHCP server on UDP port 67.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable router or have the ability to send DHCP packets to it.\n*   **No Authentication Required:** No authentication is required to send the malformed DHCP packets, making it very accessible for a remote attacker to exploit.\n*   **Basic Networking Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of network protocols and DHCP in order to craft and send a malicious packet.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is present in TP-Link VN020-F3v(T) routers running firmware version TT\\_V6.2.1021.\n*   The exploit uses a combination of an oversized hostname, manipulated length fields and a specific vendor option trigger to cause a crash\n*  The provided `poc.c` file is a proof-of-concept exploit that demonstrates these techniques, triggering the DoS.\n\nIn summary, CVE-2024-11237 represents a critical vulnerability due to its ease of exploitation, potential for RCE, and the widespread deployment of affected routers. The attack vector is simple, requiring only crafted DHCP packets without any authentication, and the impact can be significant, rendering the router unusable.",
