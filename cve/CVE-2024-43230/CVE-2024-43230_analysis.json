CWE-359 is a more specific case of CWE-200, focusing on private personal information. The vulnerability description clearly indicates exposure of sensitive information, making CWE-200 relevant. The additional detail of \"private, personal\" aligns with CWE-359, but the overall description remains broader. Although CWE-200 is discouraged, it is still the best fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe359 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** of the software leading to the impact of exposing sensitive information.\n  - **Root Cause:** Implicitly, a **missing authorization** or **improper access control**. (Not explicitly stated, only implied).\n  - **Impact:** Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200).\n  - **Specific Case:** Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-359).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the core **weakness** described in the vulnerability. The description explicitly mentions \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\". This aligns directly with CWE-200, which is a Class-level CWE. However, given the retriever results and the vulnerability description, CWE-359 is also a possibility since the content summary states sensitive data exposure. Because the vulnerability description doesn't clarify the sensitive data is necessarily *private personal information*, CWE-200 is chosen as the primary CWE, and CWE-359 is kept as a secondary option.\n\nThe decision to include CWE-359 as a secondary CWE is based on its relationship to CWE-200 (ChildOf) and the potential for the exposed information to include private personal details. This is a more specific case of CWE-200, providing additional context to the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as

which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction,

sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the
