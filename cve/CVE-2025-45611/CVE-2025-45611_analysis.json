  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-45611 Content\n\nBased on the provided content, this relates to an **Incorrect Access Control** vulnerability in the `hope-boot` project.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from using an insecure version of Shiro (version 1.4.0) for authentication, combined with interfaces within `hope-boot` that lack proper permission requirements.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Insecure Shiro version (1.4.0)\n*   Missing permission checks on `/user/edit/` interface.\n*   Incorrect Access Control\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAuthentication bypass. An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to user editing functionality.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Remote exploitation via HTTP GET request.\n*   Specific payload: `GET /login;/../user/edit/1 HTTP/1.1`\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Remote attacker with network access to the application.\n*   Ability to craft and send HTTP requests.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content suggests updating Shiro to a secure version and implementing proper permission checks on the vulnerable interface (`/user/edit/`).\n\n**More detail than official CVE description:**\n\nYes, the content provides a specific attack vector (the HTTP GET payload) and details about the vulnerable component (`/user/edit/` interface) and the root cause (Shiro version and missing permissions) which are not typically included in a basic CVE description.",

The vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary clearly indicate that the `/user/edit/` interface lacks proper permission checks.\nThe retriever results also list CWE-862 as a candidate, further supporting this classification.\nCWE-306 was considered but is less likely because the issue seems to be related to missing authorization checks after potential authentication, rather than a complete absence of authentication.\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they directly address the root cause and impact of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
