# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-46750

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved PCI Add **missing bridge lock** to pci_bus_lock() One of the true positives that the cfg_access_lock lockdep effort identified is this sequence WARNING CPU 14 PID 1 at drivers/pci/pci.c4886 pci_bridge_secondary_bus_reset+0x5d/0x70 RIP 0010pci_bridge_secondary_bus_reset+0x5d/0x70 Call Trace ? __warn+0x8c/0x190 ? pci_bridge_secondary_bus_reset+0x5d/0x70 ? report_bug+0x1f8/0x200 ? handle_bug+0x3c/0x70 ? exc_invalid_op+0x18/0x70 ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20 ? pci_bridge_secondary_bus_reset+0x5d/0x70 pci_reset_bus+0x1d8/0x270 vmd_probe+0x778/0xa10 pci_device_probe+0x95/0x120 Where pci_reset_bus() users are triggering unlocked secondary bus resets. Ironically pci_bus_reset(), several calls down from pci_reset_bus(), uses pci_bus_lock() before issuing the reset which locks everything *but* the bridge itself. For the same motivation as adding bridge = pci_upstream_bridge(dev) if (bridge) pci_dev_lock(bridge) to pci_reset_function() for the bus and cxl_bus reset cases, add pci_dev_lock() for @bus->self to pci_bus_lock().

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **missing bridge lock**
- **impact:** unlocked secondary bus resets
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** pci_bus_lock() in PCI bridge driver

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is a missing lock in the `pci_bus_lock()` function within the Linux kernel's PCI subsystem. Specifically, the function was locking all PCI devices on a bus, including subordinate buses, but it was neglecting to lock the bridge device itself (`bus->self`). This oversight created a race condition where a secondary bus reset could be triggered without the bridge being locked, leading to potential corruption and system instability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Lock:** The primary weakness is the absence of a lock on the PCI bridge device within `pci_bus_lock()`.
- **Race Condition:** This missing lock leads to a race condition where code paths, such as `pci_reset_bus()` which are users of secondary bus resets, can operate on the PCI bus hierarchy without the necessary bridge lock.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **System Instability:** Unlocked secondary bus resets can lead to system instability, potentially causing crashes or data corruption.
- **Undefined Behavior:** Operating on the PCI bus hierarchy without proper locking could result in undefined behavior due to concurrent access.
- **Lockdep Warnings:** The kernel's lock dependency checker (`lockdep`) identifies the issue and issues warnings.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Triggering Secondary Bus Resets:** The attack vector involves triggering a secondary bus reset while the bridge is unlocked. This could occur through various mechanisms that invoke `pci_reset_bus()` or related functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Kernel-level Access:** The attacker would need to have sufficient privileges to trigger a secondary PCI bus reset, which usually requires kernel-level or device driver access.
- **Specific Hardware:** The vulnerability is related to PCI bridge devices, so an attacker would need to interact with a system having such a bridge and be able to influence device reset operations.

**Technical Details:**

- The patch adds `pci_dev_lock(bus->self)` at the beginning of the `pci_bus_lock()` function to lock the bridge.
- Corresponding `pci_dev_unlock(bus->self)` is added to `pci_bus_unlock()` and the `unlock:` label in `pci_bus_trylock()`
- The fix also adds a similar locking of the parent bridge to `pci_slot_lock()` and `pci_slot_trylock()`.
- The vulnerability was discovered due to the `cfg_access_lock` lockdep effort, which identified the missing lock in the following sequence leading to a warning:
```

```
This indicates that `pci_reset_bus()` users were triggering unlocked secondary bus resets.
- The commit message explains that the fix mirrors the locking already in place for `pci_reset_function()` for "bus" and "cxl_bus" reset cases.
- Additionally, a recursive locking deadlock fix was squashed in to properly lock parent buses and prevent potential deadlocks.

This analysis provides a comprehensive view of the vulnerability based on the provided content, which is consistent with the official description, if it becomes available.
