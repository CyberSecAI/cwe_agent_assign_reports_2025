## Analysis of CVE-2025-3174 Content

This content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it's a report *about* a vulnerability, not the CVE description itself. It provides more detail than a typical CVE description would.

Here's the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/searchLawyer.php` file of the "Time Table Generator" project.
*   The root cause is the lack of proper cleaning or validation of the `experience` parameter before it's used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   System control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The `experience` parameter in a POST request to `/searchLawyer.php` is vulnerable.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.
2.  **Input validation and filtering:**  Ensure user input conforms to the expected format.
3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the least necessary privileges.
4.  **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.
