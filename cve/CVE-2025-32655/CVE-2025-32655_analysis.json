It provides detailed information about a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the WordPress Restrict User Registration plugin.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability is a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) issue, allowing malicious script injection.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Cross Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin is vulnerable to XSS, enabling attackers to inject malicious scripts into the website.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Malicious actors can inject scripts (redirects, advertisements, HTML payloads) that will be executed when visitors access the site.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated attackers.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   No authentication required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **vPatch:** Patchstack has released a virtual patch to mitigate the issue until an official fix is available.\n*   **Remove/Replace:** The software is likely abandoned and should be removed and replaced with an alternative. Deactivating the plugin alone is insufficient without a vPatch.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Affected Software:** WordPress Restrict User Registration Plugin\n*   **Vulnerable Versions:** <= 1.0.1\n*   **Fixed Version:** N/A (as of the report)\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.1 (Medium)\n*   **OWASP Top 10:** A3: Injection\n*   **PSID:** 83429c9b35c9\n*   **Reported by:** Abdi Pranata\n*   **Published:** April 12, 2025\n*   **Last Updated:** Over a year ago, indicating the software is likely abandoned.\n\n**Note:** This content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description. It specifies the vulnerable software, versions, CVSS score, and mitigation steps.",

The **CSRF** vulnerability leads to Stored **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, represented by **CWE-79** **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**, where user-controllable input is not properly neutralized before being placed in a web page.\n\nThe decision to select **CWE-352** and **CWE-79** is based on the vulnerability description which explicitly states that a **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability allows for Stored **XSS**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as **CWE-352** is a Compound weakness that accurately describes the **CSRF** issue, and **CWE-79** is a Base weakness that accurately describes the **XSS** issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n**CWE-352** **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: The web application does not, or cannot, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n**CWE-79** **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**: The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.",
