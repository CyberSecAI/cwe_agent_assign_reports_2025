  "description": "A vulnerability was found in libzvbi up to 0.2.43. It has been rated as problematic. Affected by this issue is the function _vbi_strndup_iconv. The manipulation leads to **integer overflow**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 0.2.44 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The code maintainer was informed beforehand about the issues. She reacted very fast and highly professional.",

This can lead to other weaknesses, such as **CWE-131 Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size**, which in turn can lead to **CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write**. The hierarchical relationships here show a chain of events where an integer overflow results in an incorrect buffer size calculation, ultimately causing an out-of-bounds write.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe131[\"CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe131 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe131\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe131,cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound** in the `_vbi_strndup_iconv` function. This leads to an **incorrect calculation of buffer size** (**CWE-131**), and finally results in an **out-of-bounds write** (**CWE-787**).\n  - Root Cause: CWE-190\n  - Intermediate: CWE-131\n  - Impact: CWE-787\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound** as the primary weakness due to the vulnerability description explicitly stating \"**integer overflow**\". This is supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary which states \"Integer overflows in `libzvbi` leading to heap overflows\". Retriever results also indicate that CWE-190 is the best match.\n\n**CWE-131 Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size** and **CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write** were considered as secondary weaknesses due to the potential chain of events that can occur following an integer overflow.
