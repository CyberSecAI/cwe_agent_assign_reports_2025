# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-50375

## Vulnerability Description
A **CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function** was discovered affecting the following devices manufactured by Advantech EKI-6333AC-2G (<= 1.6.3), EKI-6333AC-2GD (<= v1.6.3) and EKI-6333AC-1GPO (<= v1.2.1). The vulnerability can be exploited by remote unauthenticated users capable of interacting with the default edgserver service enabled on the access point.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function**
- **attacker:** remote unauthenticated users
- **product:** Advantech EKI-6333AC-2G and EKI-6333AC-2GD and EKI-6333AC-1GPO
- **version:** <= 1.6.3 and <= v1.6.3 and <= v1.2.1
- **component:** default edgserver service

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authentication for a critical function in the "edgserver" service on Advantech EKI-6333AC series devices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-306 "Missing Authentication for Critical Function." Specifically, the default "edgserver" service on the affected devices does not require authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthenticated remote users can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the device.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access. An attacker needs to be able to interact with the "edgserver" service, which is enabled by default on the access point.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to interact with the "edgserver" service on the network. No authentication is required.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
