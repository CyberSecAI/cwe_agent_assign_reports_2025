# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-21859
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved USB gadget f_midi f_midi_complete to call queue_work When using USB MIDI, a lock is attempted to be acquired twice through a re-entrant call to f_midi_transmit, causing a deadlock. Fix it by using queue_work() to schedule the inner f_midi_transmit() via a high priority work queue from the completion handler.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'lock is attempted to be acquired twice through a re-entrant call to f_midi_transmit'
