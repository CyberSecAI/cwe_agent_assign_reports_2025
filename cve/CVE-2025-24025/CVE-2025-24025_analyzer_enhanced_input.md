## Vulnerability Description
Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications, and databases. Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.380, the tags page allows users to search for tags. If the search does not return any results, the query gets reflected on the error modal, which leads to **cross-site scripting**. Version 4.0.0-beta.380 fixes the issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
