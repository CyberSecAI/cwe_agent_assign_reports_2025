# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-21865

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved gtp Suppress list corruption splat in gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl(). Brad Spengler reported the list_del() corruption splat in gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl(). [0] Commit eb28fd76c0a0 (gtp Destroy device along with udp sockets netns dismantle.) added the for_each_netdev() loop in gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl() to destroy devices in each netns as done in geneve and ip tunnels. However, this could trigger ->dellink() twice for the same device during ->exit_batch_rtnl(). Say we have two netns A & B and gtp device B that resides in netns B but whose UDP socket is in netns A. 1. cleanup_net() processes netns A and then B. 2. gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl() finds the device B while iterating netns As gn->gtp_dev_list and calls ->dellink(). [ device B is not yet unlinked from netns B as unregister_netdevice_many() has not been called. ] 3. gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl() finds the device B while iterating netns Bs for_each_netdev() and calls ->dellink(). gtp_dellink() cleans up the devices hash table, unlinks the dev from gn->gtp_dev_list, and calls unregister_netdevice_queue(). Basically, calling gtp_dellink() multiple times is fine unless CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST is enabled. Lets remove for_each_netdev() in gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl() and delegate the destruction to default_device_exit_batch() as done in bareudp.

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-415 | Double Free | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE. The code attempts to free the same memory twice. |
| CWE-401 | Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime | 0.6 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE. Memory is not released which can lead to double free. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is a **Double Free (CWE-415)**, which is a variant-level CWE, indicating a specific type of memory management error. **CWE-415** can be related to **CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime)**, as a failure to manage memory lifetime can lead to double frees.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the incorrect handling of net namespaces and device cleanup, leading to a device being processed twice during the `exit_batch_rtnl` phase. This double processing results in the `gtp_dellink()` function being called multiple times for the same device. The first call frees the device, and the subsequent call results in a **double free**, triggering a kernel BUG.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis indicates a **Double Free** vulnerability (CWE-415) in the Linux kernel's gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl() function due to a flaw in how network devices are cleaned up across different network namespaces. The for_each_netdev() loop iterates network namespaces to find and destroy devices, but it can trigger the ->dellink() function twice for the same device if the device's UDP socket resides in a different namespace. This results in a double free, causing a kernel bug and system crash. The primary CWE is CWE-415 (Double Free), and a secondary CWE is CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime).
The selection is based on the vulnerability description which states "calling gtp_dellink() multiple times is fine unless CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST is enabled." This confirms that memory is being freed multiple times, leading to a double free.
The retriever results listed CWE-415 as the top candidate CWE, and the vulnerability description aligns with the characteristics of a double free.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense
