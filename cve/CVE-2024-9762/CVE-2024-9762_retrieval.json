This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Tungsten Automation Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of OXPS files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24478.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'lack of proper validation of user-supplied data', 'weakness': ['Information Disclosure Vulnerability', 'Out-Of-Bounds Read'], 'impact': ['Information Disclosure', 'disclose sensitive information', 'execute arbitrary code'], 'vector': 'malicious page or file', 'attacker': 'remote attackers', 'product': 'Tungsten Automation Power PDF', 'version': '', 'component': 'OXPS File Parsing'}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**Root Cause:**\\n- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing OXPS files within Tungsten Automation Power PDF. This lack of validation allows an attacker to trigger a read operation that goes beyond the bounds of an allocated object.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\\n- Out-of-bounds read: The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, where the program attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer. This is caused by insufficient validation of user-provided data in OXPS files.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n- Information disclosure: The primary impact of this vulnerability is the ability to disclose sensitive information from the affected system's memory due to the out-of-bounds read.\\n- Potential for arbitrary code execution: The advisory suggests that an attacker could potentially combine this vulnerability with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code within the context of the application's process.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- Malicious OXPS file: The primary attack vector is through a malicious OXPS file that, when opened by the vulnerable application, triggers the out-of-bounds read condition.\\n- Malicious page: The advisory also mentions visiting a malicious page as a way to trigger this vulnerability, however, it is not specified how this would interact with the vulnerable software.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- User interaction required: The attacker needs user interaction to exploit this vulnerability. Specifically, the user must open a malicious OXPS file or visit a malicious web page.\\n- No special privileges required: The vulnerability can be triggered without the attacker needing any special privileges on the system. The attack is conducted within the privileges of the application user.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n- The vulnerability is fixed in version 5.1 of Tungsten Automation Power PDF.\\n- The advisory mentions that the attacker can use this with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code. However, this is not the vulnerability's direct effect.\\n- The vulnerability is present in the parsing of OXPS files.\\n- The CVSS score is 3.3, with a vector of

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Tungsten Automation Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of OXPS files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24478.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'lack of proper validation of user-supplied data'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
