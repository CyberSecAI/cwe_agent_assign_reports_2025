# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-42091

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/xe Check pat.ops before dumping PAT settings We may leave pat.ops unset when running on brand new platform or when running as a VF. While the former is unlikely, the latter is valid (future) use case and will cause NPD when someone will try to dump PAT settings by debugfs. Its better to check pointer to pat.ops instead of specific .dump hook, as we have this hook always defined for every .ops variant.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper pointer checking**
- **impact:** null pointer dereference
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** drm/xe Check pat.ops before dumping PAT settings

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to a fix for a potential NULL pointer dereference in the Linux kernel's `xe_pat.c` driver file, specifically within the `xe_pat_dump` function. This aligns with the description of CVE-2024-42091.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `xe_pat_dump` function in `drivers/gpu/drm/xe/xe_pat.c` attempts to access the `dump` function pointer within the `xe->pat.ops` structure without first verifying if `xe->pat.ops` itself is a valid pointer (i.e. not NULL). In situations where `pat.ops` remains unset, such as on new platforms or when running as a virtual function (VF), this can result in a NULL pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **NULL pointer dereference:** The primary issue is the potential for dereferencing a NULL pointer `xe->pat.ops`. This happens if `xe->pat.ops` isn't properly initialized.
- **Lack of proper NULL check:** The original code only checked for the existence of the `dump` function within ops but not the `ops` itself.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Kernel crash (NPD):** A NULL pointer dereference in kernel space leads to a kernel panic, causing a denial-of-service condition. This makes the system unusable.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Debugfs interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user or a program tries to dump PAT settings using debugfs interface, which leads to a call to `xe_pat_dump`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to trigger debugfs functionality:** An attacker would need the ability to interact with debugfs and request the dumping of PAT settings for the xe driver to trigger the vulnerable code path. This typically requires at least some level of system access, however, it might be possible to trigger by other means via system calls.

**Additional notes:**

The provided patches address the issue by adding a check for `xe->pat.ops` before attempting to dereference it. This ensures that the dump function is only called if the operations structure is valid. The fix replaces the check `if (!xe->pat.ops->dump)` with `if (!xe->pat.ops) return;` as the former would dereference the potentially NULL `xe->pat.ops`.
