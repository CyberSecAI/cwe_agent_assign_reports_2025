Specifically, a denial-of-service vulnerability was present in this dependency.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The core weakness was a DoS vulnerability in a frontend dependency, which could be triggered through a crafted payload.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Temporary Web Server Restart:** Exploiting this vulnerability could cause a temporary restart of the web server due to the oversaturation of an active websocket connection. This implies service disruption and unavailability of the platform during the restart.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Crafted Payload:** Attackers could exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious payload specifically designed to trigger the DoS vulnerability.\n*   **Websocket Connection:** The attack vector was through an active websocket connection, which was used by the vulnerable dependency.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to establish a websocket connection to the vulnerable endpoint.\n*   **Payload Crafting:** The attacker needs to be capable of crafting a payload that would trigger the DoS vulnerability in the affected dependency.\n\n**Mitigation:**\n\n*   PlexTrac addressed this vulnerability by removing the vulnerable dependency and disabling the affected websocket endpoint within the platform, as no patch was available for the underlying issue.",

The vulnerability can be triggered via a crafted payload, resulting in a temporary web server restart due to the oversaturation of an active websocket connection.\n\nThe analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description, which clearly states \"**Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** vulnerability in PlexTrac allows WebSocket DoS.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary provides supporting evidence, noting that a DoS vulnerability existed in a dependency used by PlexTrac's frontend and could be triggered through a crafted payload.\n\nCWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) was considered as a potential root cause, as the vulnerability description indicates that resources are likely being allocated without proper restrictions. This is further supported by the mitigation strategy, which involved removing the vulnerable dependency and disabling the affected websocket endpoint, suggesting a lack of control over resource allocation.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-400 being a class-level weakness and CWE-770 being a more specific base-level weakness that can contribute to uncontrolled resource consumption.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the resource is no longer needed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
