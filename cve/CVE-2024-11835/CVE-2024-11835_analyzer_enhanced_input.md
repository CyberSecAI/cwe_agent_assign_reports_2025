## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2024-11835:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability existed within a dependency used by PlexTrac's frontend. Specifically, a denial-of-service vulnerability was present in this dependency.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The core weakness was a DoS vulnerability in a frontend dependency, which could be triggered through a crafted payload.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Temporary Web Server Restart:** Exploiting this vulnerability could cause a temporary restart of the web server due to the oversaturation of an active websocket connection. This implies service disruption and unavailability of the platform during the restart.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Payload:** Attackers could exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious payload specifically designed to trigger the DoS vulnerability.
*   **Websocket Connection:** The attack vector was through an active websocket connection, which was used by the vulnerable dependency.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to establish a websocket connection to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Payload Crafting:** The attacker needs to be capable of crafting a payload that would trigger the DoS vulnerability in the affected dependency.

**Mitigation:**

*   PlexTrac addressed this vulnerability by removing the vulnerable dependency and disabling the affected websocket endpoint within the platform, as no patch was available for the underlying issue.
