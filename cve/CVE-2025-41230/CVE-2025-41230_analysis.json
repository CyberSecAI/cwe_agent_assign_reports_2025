CWE-497 is a more specific type of information exposure that relates to system-level information. Given that the description doesn't specify *what* sensitive information is exposed, the general CWE-200 is more appropriate, but if more system-level details were specified CWE-497 would be a better fit. Also, the retriever results give a slightly higher score for CWE-497 from sparse analysis and a lower score from graph analysis.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe497 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively simple:\n\n1.  **WEAKNESS**: **Information disclosure vulnerability** (**CWE-200**)\n2.  Impact: Gain access to sensitive information.\n\nThe initial flaw is the information disclosure vulnerability itself, which directly leads to the impact of gaining access to sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and impact of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly states an **information disclosure vulnerability**, which aligns with **CWE-200** (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor). The impact is that a malicious actor gains access to sensitive information, reinforcing **CWE-200**.\n\nThe retriever results also suggest **CWE-200** as a potential match, along with other CWEs related to authentication and access control. However, since the description focuses on the **information disclosure** aspect, **CWE-200** is the most relevant.\n\nWhile **CWE-200** is discouraged because it is high-level and often misused, in this case, the provided evidence doesn't allow for a more specific CWE selection. The description doesn't elaborate on the type of information being disclosed or the underlying cause of the disclosure. If further details were available, a more specific CWE might be selected.\n\nThe decision to map **CWE-200** is based on the **information disclosure vulnerability** described and the resulting impact of gaining access to sensitive information. The graph relationships show that more specific types of information exposure exist, such as **CWE-497** (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere), but the current description doesn't provide enough detail to warrant using it.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*CWE-497 was considered as a potential secondary weakness since it relates to system-level information, but was rejected because the vulnerability description lacks enough detail to confirm that the sensitive information being exposed is system-level.*\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
