  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved accel/ivpu Fix locking order in ivpu_job_submit Fix **deadlock** in job submission and abort handling. When a thread aborts currently executing jobs due to a fault, it first locks the global lock protecting submitted_jobs (#1). After the last job is destroyed, it proceeds to release the related context and locks file_priv (#2). Meanwhile, in the job submission thread, the file_priv lock (#2) is taken first, and then the submitted_jobs lock (#1) is obtained when a job is added to the submitted jobs list. CPU0 CPU1 ---- ---- (for example due to a fault) (jobs submissions keep coming) lock(&vdev->submitted_jobs_lock) #1 ivpu_jobs_abort_all() job_destroy() lock(&file_priv->lock) #2 lock(&vdev->submitted_jobs_lock) #1 file_priv_release() lock(&vdev->context_list_lock) lock(&file_priv->lock) #2 This order of locking causes a **deadlock**. To resolve this issue, change the order of locking in ivpu_job_submit().",

CWE-667 (Improper Locking) is a parent Class of CWE-833, indicating that the deadlock results from some form of improper locking. CWE-764 (Multiple Locks of a Critical Resource) is another related Base CWE that can contribute to deadlocks. The relationship analysis helped confirm that while improper locking is present, the specific outcome is a deadlock, making CWE-833 the more accurate primary classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe833[\"CWE-833: Deadlock\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe764[\"CWE-764: Multiple Locks of a Critical Resource\"]\n    \n    cwe833 -->|CHILDOF| cwe667\n    cwe764 -->|CHILDOF| cwe667\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe833 primary\n    class cwe667,cwe764 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper locking** practices, specifically a locking order inversion. This leads directly to a **deadlock** when two threads attempt to acquire the same locks in opposite orders.\n  - The root cause is the **improper locking** order.\n  - The resulting impact is a **deadlock**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points to CWE-833 (Deadlock) as the primary weakness, supported by the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning the term \"**deadlock**\". The description details the scenario where two threads acquire locks in reverse order, leading to a deadlock situation. The retriever results also list CWE-833 as a highly relevant candidate.\n\nCWE-667 (Improper Locking) is a valid secondary consideration as the deadlock arises due to **improper locking**, specifically a locking order inversion. However, CWE-833 is more specific and accurately reflects the final outcome of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-764 (Multiple Locks of a Critical Resource) is also considered as a secondary candidate since multiple locks are involved.\n\nThe evidence for the root cause is: \"Fix **deadlock** in job submission and abort handling... This order of locking causes a **deadlock**. To resolve this issue, change the order of locking in ivpu_job_submit().\"\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-833 is a child of CWE-667, indicating a specific type of improper locking. This justifies choosing CWE-833 as the primary, more specific CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-833: Deadlock\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not lock or does not correctly lock a resource when the product must have exclusive access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
