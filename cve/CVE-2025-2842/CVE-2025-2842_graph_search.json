When the Jaeger UI Monitor Tab functionality is enabled in a Tempo instance managed by the Tempo Operator, the Operator creates a ClusterRoleBinding for the Service Account of the Tempo instance to grant the cluster-monitoring-view ClusterRole. This can be exploited if a user has create permissions on TempoStack and get permissions on Secret in a namespace (for example, a user has ClusterAdmin permissions for a specific namespace), as the user can read the token of the Tempo service account and therefore has access to see all cluster metrics.
