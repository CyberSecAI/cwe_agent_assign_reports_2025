While I considered more specific Base-level CWEs, CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) seems like a good secondary candidate, the evidence is stronger for CWE-862.

This aligns directly with CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), where the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized to perform the requested action.\n\nThe \"Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance\" provides helpful distinctions. The key phrase \"**insufficient authorization controls**\" clearly indicates an authorization issue rather than an authentication one, ruling out CWE-306. The guidance also notes that CWE-285 is a general category and CWE-862 is more specific.\n\nI also considered CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) since an attacker could potentially modify a key value to access another user's data. However, the description focuses more on a general lack of authorization checks, making CWE-862 the stronger fit.\n\nThe final decision is based on the direct evidence of **insufficient authorization controls** and the guidance to choose the most specific CWE available. CWE-862 is at the Class level, and the guidance recommends considering Base-level children, but none fit the description as accurately.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- CWE-862: Missing Authorization: The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n- CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key: The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.",
