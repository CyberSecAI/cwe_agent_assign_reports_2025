  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-48748 Content\n\nThis content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2025-48748. It provides significantly more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nA hard-coded password was used by Netwrix Directory Manager (formerly Imanami GroupID) v10 and earlier. While the password was replaced with customer-supplied credentials starting in v9, the hard-coded user account was not removed from the installer and persists on the Windows server.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Hard-coded credentials\n*   Persistence of a hard-coded user account even after upgrades.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAn attacker with network access to Netwrix Directory Manager could potentially authenticate as an administrator to the Windows server on which it is installed or to the product itself, compromising the system and any integrated Identity Stores.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Network access to Netwrix Directory Manager.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Ability to communicate over any network on which Netwrix Directory Manager is accessible.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Immediate:** Disable internet access to Netwrix Directory Manager.\n*   **Update:** Upgrade to the latest release of v10 (v10 SR2 (10.0.7784.0) or later).\n*   **Remediation:** Examine IIS Application Pools for the use of the `GroupIDSSUser` as the Application Pool Identity. If found, create a new service account and update the Application Pool Identity, then delete the `GroupIDSSUser` local Windows account.\n*   **Utility:** Use the provided utility ([https://releases.netwrix.com/products/groupid/10.0/NDM10-ADV-2025-013-Utility.zip](https://releases.netwrix.com/products/groupid/10.0/NDM10-ADV-2025-013-Utility.zip)) to assess and remediate the vulnerability.\n*   **Instructions:** Follow the published instructions ([https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/GroupID_10.0_NDM10-ADV-2025-013-Utility/resource/GroupID_10.0_NDM10-ADV-2025-013-Utility.pdf](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/GroupID_10.0_NDM10-ADV-2025-013-Utility/resource/GroupID_10.0_NDM10-ADV-2025-013-Utility.pdf)).\n\n**CVSS Scores:**\n\n*   CVSS 4.0 Score: 10.0\n*   CVSS 3.1 Score: 10.0 / 9.0\n\n**Exploitability:**\n\n*   Publicly known?: No\n*   Exploit available?: No\n*   Actively exploited?: No",

Since the vulnerability specifically involves a hard-coded password, CWE-259, a Variant of CWE-798, is the more specific and appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe259 primary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **hard-coded password** (CWE-259), which allows an attacker with network access to potentially authenticate as an administrator, leading to compromise of the system and integrated Identity Stores.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) as the most appropriate CWE due to the specific mention of a hard-coded password in the vulnerability description. The evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section strongly supports this selection: \"A **hard-coded password** was used by Netwrix Directory Manager\". The retriever results also ranked CWE-259 and its parent CWE-798 highly. The final decision to prioritize CWE-259 was based on its higher specificity as a variant of CWE-798.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified
