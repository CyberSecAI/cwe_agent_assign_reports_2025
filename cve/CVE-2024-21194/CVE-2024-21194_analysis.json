CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is considered as a secondary candidate because the successful attack results in a denial of service (hang or crash). CWE-770 is related to CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) as its child and CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) and other CWEs as its parent.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cweNVD[\"CWE-NVD-noinfo: No Information Available\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe770 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cweNVD primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an unspecified weakness in the InnoDB component. A high-privileged attacker with network access exploits this **unspecified vulnerability**, leading to a hang or crash of the MySQL Server, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment strongly relies on the provided evidence, primarily the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" and \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\". The primary classification is CWE-NVD-noinfo due to the lack of detailed information about the root cause.\n\nThe decision to include CWE-770 is based on the impact description, which mentions a denial-of-service condition. However, without knowing the exact mechanism that causes the resource exhaustion, the confidence in this secondary classification remains low.\n\nThe selected CWEs represent the optimal level of specificity given the available information. A more detailed analysis would require further investigation into the specific **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is considered as a secondary candidate because the successful attack results in a denial of service (hang or crash). CWE-770 is related to CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) as its child and CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) and other CWEs as its parent.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cweNVD[\"CWE-NVD-noinfo: No Information Available\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe770 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cweNVD primary\n    class cwe770 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an unspecified weakness in the InnoDB component. A high-privileged attacker with network access exploits this **unspecified vulnerability**, leading to a hang or crash of the MySQL Server, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment strongly relies on the provided evidence, primarily the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" and \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\". The primary classification is CWE-NVD-noinfo due to the lack of detailed information about the root cause.\n\nThe decision to include CWE-770 is based on the impact description, which mentions a denial-of-service condition. However, without knowing the exact mechanism that causes the resource exhaustion, the confidence in this secondary classification remains low.\n\nThe selected CWEs represent the optimal level of specificity given the available information. A more detailed analysis would require further investigation into the specific **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
