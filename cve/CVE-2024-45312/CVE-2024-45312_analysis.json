  "description": "Overleaf is a web-based collaborative LaTeX editor. Overleaf Community Edition and Server Pro prior to version 5.0.7 (or 4.2.7 for the 4.x series) contain a vulnerability that allows an arbitrary language parameter in client spelling requests to be passed to the `aspell` executable running on the server. This causes `aspell` to attempt to load a dictionary file with an arbitrary filename. File access is limited to the scope of the overleaf server. The problem is patched in versions 5.0.7 and 4.2.7. Previous versions can be upgraded using the Overleaf toolkit `bin/upgrade` command. Users unable to upgrade may block POST requests to `/spelling/check` via a Web Application Firewall will prevent access to the vulnerable spell check feature. However, upgrading is advised.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45312:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the Overleaf Community Edition and Server Pro. Specifically, the `language` parameter in client spelling requests was not properly validated before being passed to the `aspell` executable. This allowed for arbitrary values to be passed as the language parameter.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **CWE-641 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Parameter):** The application fails to properly sanitize the language parameter, which is then used to construct a command for the `aspell` executable.\n- **Arbitrary Dictionary Loading:** By manipulating the `language` parameter, an attacker could force `aspell` to attempt to load a dictionary file with an arbitrary filename.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unspecified but potentially severe:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to control the dictionary file `aspell` attempts to load. This could lead to various impacts, including denial of service or other attacks depending on how `aspell` handles invalid or malicious dictionary files, potentially enabling arbitrary code execution depending on `aspell` itself\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is triggered via network requests. Specifically, by crafting a malicious POST request to the `/spelling/check` endpoint with an arbitrary `language` parameter.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the `/spelling/check` endpoint of a vulnerable Overleaf instance. This implies network access to the server.\n- No authentication is needed, since the authentication check happens after the vulnerable code.\n- The attacker does not need any special privileges or be an authenticated user.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The provided patch commit `b5e5d39` demonstrates the fix. The fix implements checks on the language code, validating it before passing it to the `aspell` executable.\n- The vulnerability affects Overleaf Community Edition and Server Pro versions prior to 5.0.7 and 4.2.7 (for the 4.x series).\n- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Stefan Schiller from SonarSource.\n- A workaround was provided - blocking POST requests to `/spelling/check` - but upgrading is advised",

The application fails to restrict the filename passed to aspell, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary files. |\n| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The lack of sanitization of the language parameter could potentially lead to OS Command Injection. |\n| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate.

CWE-78 and CWE-22 represent potential consequences if the arbitrary filename handling leads to command injection or path traversal, respectively. These are children of more general injection or access control CWEs.

This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary filename to be loaded as a dictionary. This could lead to:\n1.  **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') (CWE-78)** if the filename contains OS command special elements.\n2.  **Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') (CWE-22)** if the filename contains path traversal sequences.\nThe end result is arbitrary file access, as described in the vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis of the vulnerability description indicates a weakness related to improper input validation, specifically concerning the language parameter passed to the `aspell` executable. The retriever results and complete CWE specifications were used to narrow down the potential CWEs.\n\nThe strongest evidence supporting the classification comes from the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, specifically:\n\n*   \"allows an arbitrary language parameter in client spelling requests to be passed to the `aspell` executable\"\n*   \"This causes `aspell` to attempt to load a dictionary file with an arbitrary filename.\"\n*   \"The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization... the `language` parameter in client spelling requests was not properly validated.\"\n\nThese points directly relate to the application's failure to restrict the filename passed to `aspell`, leading to the selection of CWE-641 as the primary weakness. The other potential CWEs (CWE-78, CWE-22) were considered as secondary candidates because they represent possible exploitation routes stemming from the initial weakness.\n\nCWE-641 is chosen as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause: the **improper restriction** of filenames. This is more specific than a generic input validation error.\n\nOther CWEs Considered but Not Used:\n\n*   CWE-78 and CWE-22: These were considered as secondary weaknesses because they describe potential exploitation routes.\n*   CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery): Not directly applicable, as the vulnerability doesn't involve making requests to internal servers.\n*   CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')): Potentially applicable if the arbitrary file access leads to code execution, but not the primary issue.\n*   CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine): Not applicable, as the vulnerability doesn't involve a template engine.",
