# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-47941

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability has been identified in Solid Edge SE2024 (All versions < V224.0 Update 9). The affected applications contain an **out of bounds read past the end of an allocated structure** while parsing specially crafted PAR files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47941:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An out-of-bounds read occurs when parsing specially crafted PAR files within the affected Solid Edge application. The application attempts to read data beyond the allocated memory structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125):** The vulnerability stems from the software reading memory outside the bounds of the allocated buffer when processing a PAR file, potentially leading to unintended behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This implies the attacker could potentially take full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Parsing:** The vulnerability is triggered when the Solid Edge application opens a specially crafted PAR file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to open a malicious PAR file using the vulnerable Solid Edge application. This suggests that the attacker likely needs to deliver a specially crafted file to the user and leverage social engineering or other methods for the user to open the file.
- **Local Access:** This vulnerability has an attack vector of "Local" (AV:L). However, that simply means the user must open the file on their local machine, regardless of where the file itself came from.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability is specific to Solid Edge SE2024 versions prior to Update 9 (V224.0).
- A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 and a CVSS v4.0 base score of 7.3 indicate a high severity.
- Siemens recommends updating to version V224.0 Update 9 or later to mitigate this vulnerability.
- A workaround for this vulnerability is to avoid opening untrusted PAR files in the affected applications.
