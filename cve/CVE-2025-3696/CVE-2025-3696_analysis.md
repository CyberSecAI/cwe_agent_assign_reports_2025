# Analysis for CVE-2025-3696

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship considered was the direct match of the vulnerability description to the definition of CWE-89. No other parent, child, or peer relationships significantly influenced the decision, as the evidence directly supports CWE-89 as the root cause. The abstraction level of Base aligns well with identifying the specific weakness.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain consists of a single point:
1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-89 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly states that the vulnerability is due to **SQL injection** via manipulation of the Name argument in the `/search/search_stock.php` file.

The evidence is: "The manipulation of the argument Name leads to **sql injection**".

The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the primary candidate, with a score of 1.0. The other CWEs listed do not accurately describe the vulnerability. CWE-79 and CWE-80 relate to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), while the vulnerability is explicitly an SQL Injection. CWE-434 relates to unrestricted file uploads, which is not mentioned in the description.

CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an SQL command.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.



## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component
in another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the
intended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 616.61
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
