# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-37972

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved Input mtk-pmic-keys - fix possible **null pointer dereference** In mtk_pmic_keys_probe, the regs parameter is only set if the button is parsed in the device tree. However, on hardware where the button is left floating, that node will most likely be removed not to enable that input. In that case the code will try to dereference a null pointer. Lets use the regs struct instead as it is defined for all supported platforms. Note that it is ok setting the key reg even if that latter is disabled as the interrupt wont be enabled anyway.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Weakness:** null pointer dereference
- **Product:** Linux kernel
- **Component:** mtk_pmic_keys_probe

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-476 | NULL Pointer Dereference | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis

The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of the vulnerability description's **null pointer dereference** weakness to CWE-476's definition. While CWE-754 (Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions) is a parent, CWE-476 is more specific and accurately reflects the vulnerability. No chain relationships are relevant in this case, as the description focuses solely on the direct dereference of a NULL pointer.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain is straightforward: a conditional check is missed, leading to a **null pointer dereference**.

1.  **Root Cause:** Missing conditional check (implicitly leading to uninitialized or NULL value, but that is not the primary issue)
2.  **Weakness:** **NULL Pointer Dereference** (CWE-476)
3.  **Impact:** System crash or unexpected behavior.

## Summary of Analysis

The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions a **null pointer dereference**. The retriever results strongly support CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference) as the primary candidate. The evidence is strong and directly related to the vulnerability. The graph relationships confirm that while higher-level classifications exist, CWE-476 is the most specific and accurate representation of the weakness. The decision to use CWE-476 is based on its direct relevance to the vulnerability description, its base abstraction level, and the MITRE mapping guidance.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.

- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product obtains a value from an untrusted source, converts this value to a pointer, and dereferences the resulting pointer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.
