# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-50006

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ext4 fix **i_data_sem unlock order in ext4_ind_migrate()** Fuzzing reports a possible **deadlock** in jbd2_log_wait_commit. This issue is triggered when an EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE ioctl is set to require synchronous updates because the file descriptor is opened with O_SYNC. This can lead to the jbd2_journal_stop() function calling jbd2_might_wait_for_commit(), potentially causing a **deadlock** if the EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE call races with a write(2) system call. This problem only arises when CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING is enabled. In this case, the jbd2_might_wait_for_commit macro locks jbd2_handle in the jbd2_journal_stop function while i_data_sem is locked. This triggers lockdep because the jbd2_journal_start function might also lock the same jbd2_handle simultaneously. Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with syzkaller. Rule add

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is a **deadlock** (CWE-833), which arises from **improper resource locking** (CWE-413). The **improper resource locking** can be viewed as a specific instance of **concurrent execution with improper synchronization** (CWE-362), often referred to as a race condition. **Improper locking** (CWE-667) is a broader category that encompasses the root cause.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper locking order** within the `ext4_ind_migrate()` function. This leads to a race condition where the `EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE` ioctl and a `write(2)` system call contend for the same resources. The race condition, in turn, results in a **deadlock**, causing a system hang and denial of service.

Improper Locking Order -> Race Condition -> Deadlock -> System Hang (DoS)

## Summary of Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-833 (**Deadlock**), as the vulnerability description explicitly states a potential **deadlock** in `jbd2_log_wait_commit`. This **deadlock** occurs due to a race condition and **improper locking** order, specifically within the `ext4_ind_migrate()` function when the `EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE` ioctl races with a `write(2)` system call.

Supporting evidence:
- "Fuzzing reports a possible **deadlock** in jbd2_log_wait_commit."
- "This issue is triggered when an EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE ioctl is set to require synchronous updates because the file descriptor is opened with O_SYNC."
- "This can lead to the jbd2_journal_stop() function calling jbd2_might_wait_for_commit(), potentially causing a **deadlock** if the EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE call races with a write(2) system call."

CWE-413 (**Improper Resource Locking**) is also a relevant CWE, as the root cause of the **deadlock** is an **incorrect locking order** in the `ext4_ind_migrate()` function.

CWE-362 (**Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')**) is considered because the **deadlock** is triggered by a race condition between the `EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE` ioctl and the `write(2)` system call.

CWE-667 (**Improper Locking**) is also considered as a more general description of the **locking** issue but is not as specific as CWE-413 or CWE-833.

I am confident in this assessment because of the explicit mention of a **deadlock** and supporting evidence of the **improper locking** conditions that trigger it. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-833 representing the direct vulnerability and CWE-413 explaining the root cause.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review

## CWE-833: Deadlock
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74

- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
