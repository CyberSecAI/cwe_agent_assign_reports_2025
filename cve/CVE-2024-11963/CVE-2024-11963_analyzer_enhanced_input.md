## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in code-projects Responsive Hotel Site 1.0. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /admin/room.php. The manipulation of the argument troom leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** code-projects Responsive Hotel Site
- **version:** 1
- **component:** /admin/room.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `room.php` file of the "Responsive Hotel Site Using PHP With Source Code" project. The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `troom` parameter before using it in SQL queries. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (from the `troom` parameter) into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized database access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive data leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Data tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **Comprehensive system control:**  In severe cases, attackers might gain broader control over the system.
- **Service interruption:** Exploitation could lead to a disruption of the application's service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through an HTTP POST request to `room.php`.
- The malicious SQL code is injected via the `troom` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker can be an unauthenticated user

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes Proof-of-Concept (PoC) payloads for different types of SQL injection techniques:
    - Boolean-based blind SQL injection
    - Error-based SQL injection
    - Time-based blind SQL injection
- The content includes specific examples of exploitation using `sqlmap`, further confirming the vulnerability.

**Suggested Repair:**
- The following are the suggested repair from the content.
    1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** Use prepared statements to separate SQL code from user input data.
    2.  **Input validation and filtering:** Validate and filter user input to ensure it conforms to the expected format.
    3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with minimum necessary permissions for database connection and avoid using accounts with advanced permissions (such as' root 'or' admin ').
    4.  **Regular security audits:** Regularly conduct code and system security audits to promptly identify and fix potential security vulnerabilities.
