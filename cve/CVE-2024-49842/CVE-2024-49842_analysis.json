CWE-1260 (Improper Handling of Overlap Between Protected Memory Ranges) is considered as a contributing factor, especially since the vulnerability involves memory mapping into protected VM address space.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe1260[\"CWE-1260: Improper Handling of Overlap Between Protected Memory Ranges\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe1260 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe1260 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect API restrictions**, leading to potential **memory corruption**, specifically an out-of-bounds write. The overlapping memory ranges may facilitate this out-of-bounds write.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as the primary candidate due to the explicit mention of **memory corruption**. The **incorrect API restrictions** are the root cause of this weakness. The description of memory mapping into protected VM address space suggests that CWE-1260 (Improper Handling of Overlap Between Protected Memory Ranges) could be a contributing factor, but the primary issue is the out-of-bounds write itself.\n\nThe evidence provided is moderately strong, with clear indicators of **memory corruption** and **incorrect API restrictions**. The graph relationships support the selection of CWE-787 as the primary issue, with CWE-1260 potentially contributing to the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity. CWE-787 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n##

Isolated memory regions can be defined on different memory spaces in a design (e.g. system physical address, virtual address, memory mapped IO).\n\n\nEach memory cell should be mapped and assigned a system address that the core software can use to read/write to that memory. It is possible to map the same memory cell to multiple system addresses such that read/write to any of the aliased system addresses would be decoded to the same memory cell.\n\n\nThis is commonly done in hardware designs for redundancy and simplifying address decoding logic. If one of the memory regions is corrupted or faulty, then that hardware can switch to using the data in the mirrored memory region. Memory aliases can also be created in the system address map if the address decoder unit ignores higher order address bits when mapping a smaller address region into the full system address.\n\n\nA common security weakness that can exist in such memory mapping is that aliased memory regions could have different read/write access protections enforced by the hardware such that an untrusted agent is blocked from accessing a memory address but is not blocked from accessing the corresponding aliased memory address. Such inconsistency can then be used to bypass the access protection of the primary memory block and read or modify the protected memory.\n\n\nAn untrusted agent could also possibly create memory aliases in the system address map for malicious purposes if it is able to change the mapping of an address region or modify memory region sizes.\n",
