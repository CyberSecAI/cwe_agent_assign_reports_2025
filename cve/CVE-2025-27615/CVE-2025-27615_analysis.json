  "description": "umatiGateway is software for connecting OPC Unified Architecture servers with an MQTT broker utilizing JSON messages. The user interface may possibly be publicly accessible with umatiGateways provided docker-compose file. With this access, the configuration can be viewed and altered. Commit 5d81a3412bc0051754a3095d89a06d6d743f2b16 uses `127.0.0.180808080` to limit access to the local network. For those who are unable to use this proposed patch, a firewall on Port 8080 may block remote access, but the workaround may not be perfect because Docker may also bypass a firewall by its iptable based rules for port forwarding.",

It provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from binding the UI to all interfaces (0.0.0.0) in the `docker-compose` file, making it publicly accessible.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Publicly accessible UI due to incorrect port binding in the `docker-compose` file.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Configuration can be viewed and altered by unauthorized users.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Network access to the exposed port (8080).\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Network access to the server running the `umatiGateway` application. No specific privileges or user interaction are required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Use `\"127.0.0.1:8080:8080\"` in the `docker-compose` file to bind the UI to the localhost interface only.\n*   Implement a firewall on port 8080, although the content notes Docker may bypass firewall rules.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\nThe vulnerable line in the `docker-compose` file (in commit `abe73096a17307327f0d6dc0ed4db1fb93464521`) is:\n\n```yaml\n- 8080:8080\n```\n\nThe corrected line is:\n\n```yaml\n- \"127.0.0.1:8080:8080\"\n```\n\nThe fix is implemented in commit `e4f11f6d28d0a59db04a5717f8cbf0fe41a8572e`.\n\n**CVSS v3 base metrics:**\n\n*   Attack Vector: Network\n*   Attack Complexity: Low\n*   Privileges Required: None\n*   User Interaction: None\n*   Scope: Unchanged\n*   Confidentiality: None\n*   Integrity: Low\n*   Availability: High\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H",

The vulnerability stems directly from this incorrect binding, making the user interface accessible from unintended networks. CWE-668 is a higher-level class that describes the broader problem of exposing a resource to the wrong sphere, but CWE-1327 provides a more specific description of the actual coding error. The relationship between these CWEs influenced the decision to select CWE-1327 as the primary weakness, as it more accurately reflects the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1327[\"CWE-1327: Binding to an Unrestricted IP Address\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe1327 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1327 primary\n    class cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect** configuration where the application binds to an unrestricted IP address (0.0.0.0) instead of localhost (127.0.0.1). This leads to the exposure of the user interface to the network. Finally, unauthorized users can view and alter configurations.\n\nRoot Cause: CWE-1327\nImpact: Exposure of User Interface\nImpact: View and Alter Configurations\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The **root cause** is the **weakness** of binding to an unrestricted IP address. The evidence is clear: \"The vulnerability stems from binding the UI to all interfaces (0.0.0.0) in the `docker-compose` file, making it publicly accessible.\"\n\nThe relationship between CWE-1327 and CWE-668 shows that CWE-1327 is a more specific instance of a broader class. While CWE-668 could be considered, CWE-1327 is preferred because it directly identifies the coding error, which is the unrestricted IP address binding. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-1327 is a base-level CWE that accurately describes the vulnerability.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-923 (Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints): This CWE is related but more general. While the vulnerability involves a communication channel, the root cause is specifically the IP address binding rather than a broader restriction issue.\n*   CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function): Authentication is not missing, but the application's configuration interface is exposed due to the unrestricted binding.\n*   CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)): This is not applicable as there is no server-side request being forged.",
