## Vulnerability Description
**Insecure Permissions** vulnerability in Friendica v.2023.12 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information and execute arbitrary code via the cid parameter of the calendar event feature.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Insecure Permissions**
- **impact:** obtain sensitive information and execute arbitrary code
- **vector:** cid parameter of the calendar event feature
- **attacker:** remote attacker
- **product:** Friendica
- **version:** v.2023.12

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-27730:

**CVE-2024-27730: Access control, insecure direct object reference (IDOR) issue in calendar event feature.**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control checks when creating and editing calendar events. Specifically, the `cid` (contact ID) parameter, which determines the user associated with the event, can be manipulated by an attacker.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The system relies on the `cid` parameter, which can be directly modified by an attacker to impersonate other users.
    *   **Insufficient Access Control:** The application does not verify if the user making the request is authorized to create or modify events on behalf of the specified `cid`.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Event Creation Impersonation:** An attacker can create calendar events as any other user on the Friendica server.
    *   **Combined with XSS:** When combined with the stored XSS vulnerability (CVE-2024-27729) in the calendar event feature, an attacker can inject malicious scripts into events created on behalf of other users. This would allow the attacker to steal session cookies or password hashes of targeted users when they view the manipulated events.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Direct Parameter Manipulation:**  An attacker can directly modify the `cid` parameter in the `/calendar/api/create` POST request.
    *   **Event Edit:** Attackers can create an event with their own user ID, then modify that event to be associated with another user (by setting the `cid` to `0`), causing it to be shared on the victim's feed.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be a registered user of the Friendica instance.
    *   The attacker needs to know the contact ID (`cid`) of the target user. However this is typically sequential.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Friendica server.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

* The provided content explains in detail how this vulnerability can be exploited.
* It clarifies that while creating an event with a different user's CID does not share it by default, editing the event with cid=0 triggers sharing.
* This IDOR vulnerability, in combination with stored XSS, allows for a more severe attack targeting any user on the server, not just the attacker's followers.
* The fix involved preventing overwriting the `cid` during event edits.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
