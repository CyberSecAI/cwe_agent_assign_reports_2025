While CWE-284 is a broader category, the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**improper authorization** vulnerabilities,\" making CWE-285 a more specific and appropriate choice. This is further supported by the CWE Classification Guidance provided. The guidance states to prefer CWE-285 over CWE-284 when the issue clearly involves improper or missing role checks. Since the vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to perform unauthorized operations, this suggests a problem with authorization checks after authentication.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper authorization [CWE-285]** in FortiWeb. This **weakness** allows an authenticated attacker to send crafted requests to perform unauthorized ADOM operations.\n\nVulnerability Chain:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **CWE-285** (Improper Authorization) - The system incorrectly performs or does not perform authorization checks.\n2.  **Impact:** An authenticated attacker can perform unauthorized ADOM operations.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed to CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) due to the explicit mention of \"**improper authorization vulnerabilities**\" in the vulnerability description. The CWE Classification Guidance reinforces this selection, advising to use CWE-285 when the issue involves improper or missing role checks, as opposed to the broader CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). The evidence from the vulnerability description, including the ability of an authenticated attacker to perform unauthorized ADOM operations via crafted requests, supports the choice of CWE-285 as the primary CWE.\n\nThe graph relationships further solidify this decision. CWE-285 is a child of CWE-284. The specificity of CWE-285 makes it a more appropriate choice than its parent.\n\nThe selection of CWE-285 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **improper authorization** mechanism.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
