## Vulnerability Description
Netgate pfSense CE (prior to 2.8.0 beta release) and corresponding Plus builds are vulnerable to command injection in the OpenVPN widget due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input to the OpenVPN management interface. An authenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary OpenVPN management commands via the remipp parameter.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** OpenVPN widget
- **rootcause:** **improper sanitization of user-supplied input to the OpenVPN management interface, improper input sanitization**
- **weakness:** **command injection, command injection**
- **product:** Netgate pfSense CE
- **attacker:** authenticated attacker
- **version:** prior to 2.8.0 beta release

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2024-54780 based on provided content:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-54780
**CVE Description:** OpenVPN Widget Command Injection

**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from unsanitized user input (`$port`, `$remipp`, `$client_id`) in `openvpn.widget.php`. Specifically, the `$remipp` field, used to terminate a client connection, is passed to the `openvpn_kill_client` function without proper filtering.

**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Command Injection:**  The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system via the `remipp` parameter.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code directly uses user-supplied input to construct a command executed on the system.

**3. Impact of exploitation:**

*   An authenticated user with permission to the Dashboard can execute commands on the system.
*   While the impact is described as "fairly low" because the interface limits available functions, it still allows for command execution.

**4. Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the OpenVPN widget on the pfSense dashboard.
*   The attacker crafts a malicious payload in the `remipp` field, including a newline character (`%0A`) followed by the desired command.
*   The payload is submitted via a POST request to the `openvpn.widget.php` script.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Authenticated user with access to the OpenVPN widget.
*   Understanding of command injection techniques.

**6. Mitigation or fix:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by sanitizing the input parameters in the `openvpn.widget.php` file.
*   The fix was pushed to the `master` branch on November 22, 2024.
*   Patches are available via the System Patches Package for pfSense Plus 24.11 and CE 2.7.2.



**Additional Notes:**

*   The blog post from brillantit.com provides more detailed information about the vulnerability and its exploitation than the Netgate announcement.
*   The github commit shows the specific code change that addresses the vulnerability (encoding the reason field).
*   The Netgate post references several other vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-57273, CVE-2024-54779) that were addressed concurrently.
