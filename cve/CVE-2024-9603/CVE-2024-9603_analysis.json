CWE-787 is a possible consequence of type confusion leading to memory corruption. CWE-843 is a base CWE and a child of CWE-704, Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast.

The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this as the root cause.\n\nThe primary CWE match, according to similar CVE descriptions, is CWE-843, \"Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\". This aligns directly with the vulnerability description.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-843 as the top result.\n\nCWE-787 \"Out-of-bounds Write\" is included as a secondary candidate because heap corruption often leads to out-of-bounds writes.\n\nI am confident in this assessment based on the provided evidence.

The security implication is that an attacker can manipulate the type of data being processed, leading to unexpected behavior and potential code execution.\n\n**CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write**: This is a secondary CWE because **Type Confusion** can lead to writing to unintended memory locations.
