  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the usage of an untrusted search path when loading DLLs.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: DLL Hijacking.\n- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious DLL in a location where Yandex Browser searches for DLLs, and have it loaded instead of the legitimate one. This could lead to a complete compromise of the user's system if the attacker gains sufficient privileges.\n- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to place a malicious DLL with the name of a DLL that Yandex Browser attempts to load.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have write access to a directory where the browser searches for DLLs before a legitimate DLL with the same name is loaded. This is typically achieved by placing the malicious DLL in a folder higher up in the search path.",

CWE-427 is a peer of CWE-426 and represents a more general case where the search path is fixed or controlled but contains elements under the control of unintended actors. The description specifically mentions an \"**untrusted search path**,\" making CWE-426 the more precise fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe426[\"CWE-426: Untrusted Search Path\"]\n    cwe427[\"CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe673[\"CWE-673: External Control Over System or Configuration Setting\"]\n    cwe642[\"CWE-642: External Control of Critical State Data\"]\n\n    cwe426 -- PEEROF --> cwe427\n    cwe426 -- CHILDOF --> cwe673\n    cwe426 -- CHILDOF --> cwe668\n    cwe426 -- CHILDOF --> cwe642\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe426 primary\n    class cwe427 secondary\n    class cwe668,cwe673,cwe642 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **untrusted search path** (CWE-426), which leads to the **DLL hijacking** (impact).\n- The root cause is the **improper configuration of the search path**.\n- The impact is the potential for malicious DLLs to be loaded and executed, leading to arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-426 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of an \"**untrusted search path**\" in the vulnerability description. The retriever results and keyphrase analysis consistently highlighted CWE-426 and CWE-427. While CWE-427 is a closely related CWE, CWE-426 is more specific to the described **root cause**. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-426 and CWE-427 are peers, with CWE-426 being a more precise fit in this scenario. The final decision is based on the evidence directly provided in the vulnerability description, making CWE-426 the optimal choice at the base level of abstraction.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
