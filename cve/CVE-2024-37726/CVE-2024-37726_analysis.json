This allows a low-privileged user to manipulate the file system with symlinks and trick the application into writing to or overwriting arbitrary files in the system.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Uncontrolled file write location by a SYSTEM privileged process.\n- The application is susceptible to symlink attacks due to insufficient checks on the target location of file write operations.\n- Use of Oplocks can be manipulated by low privileged users to gain write access to arbitrary files.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Arbitrary file overwrite or deletion of critical system files by low-privileged users.\n- Potential privilege escalation by overwriting critical system files or startup scripts.\n- Complete compromise of the system.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Utilizing the \"Export System Info\" function in MSI Center which causes file operations.\n- Exploiting file system manipulation techniques such as symlinks and junctions in conjunction with Oplocks.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- Low-privileged user access on the system.\n- Ability to create directories, files, junctions, and symbolic links.\n- Knowledge of the vulnerable application's behavior and the necessary steps for the exploit.",
