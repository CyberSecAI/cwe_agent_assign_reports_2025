Since the vulnerability description specifically mentions \"Windows Kerberos\", which can be considered system information, CWE-497 is a plausible secondary candidate, but lacks specific evidence.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe497 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a root cause leading to **information disclosure**. The specific root cause is not provided in the description. The vulnerability description only identifies the high-level impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is described as a Windows Kerberos **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. The provided information is very limited, with no details about the root cause.\n\nThe primary CWE candidate is CWE-200 **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** because the vulnerability description explicitly uses the term \"Information Disclosure Vulnerability\". Although CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE and is generally discouraged, it is the best fit given the limited information.\n\nCWE-497 **Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere** is a plausible secondary candidate, since the vulnerability is in \"Windows Kerberos\" and Kerberos is a system component. However, without more information about *what* information is being disclosed, it is hard to determine if this is the correct CWE.\n\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-497, but with a lower confidence score than CWE-200. Other CWEs from the retriever results (e.g. CWE-126, CWE-134) are not relevant, as there is no information about the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   CWE-200 **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**: The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n*   CWE-497 **Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere**: The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.",
