Here\\'s an extraction of relevant information:\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\n\\nThe vulnerability is an i18n XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) issue discovered with `$wgUseXssLanguage`. It was found during testing using the `uselang=x-xss` parameter with Special:Homepage.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n\\n*   **XSS:** The core vulnerability is a cross-site scripting flaw.\\n*   **i18n issue:** The XSS is related to internationalization (i18n) features.\\n*   **Improper output encoding/escaping:** The description suggests that the issue stems from how messages are parsed, specifically the description field. Only the description is parsed using `$( \\'<p>\\' ).html()`, while other message keys are displayed using `text()`, which provides escaping.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n\\nThe impact is not explicitly stated, but XSS vulnerabilities can allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n\\n*   Visiting `Special:Homepage` with the `uselang=x-xss` parameter.\\n*   The vulnerability exists in `growthexperiments-homepage-suggestededits-tasktype-description-*`.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n\\n*   An attacker needs to be able to control the `uselang` parameter in the URL.\\n*   No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.\\n\\n**Mitigation or fix:**\\n\\n*   A patch (F58441954: T386963.patch) has been created and applied.\\n*   The fix adjusts the method used to parse the description to prevent XSS.\\n*   The patch was merged into the `master` branch of the `mediawiki/extensions/GrowthExperiments` repository (Change #1122163).\\n*   The fix was deployed to production on February 24, 2025.\\n*   The task was closed as resolved.\\n\\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\\n\\n*   The vulnerability was initially discovered using a tool/methodology described in T340201 (\"Use custom language code to find i18n XSS issues\").\\n*   A related issue was identified in VisualEditor, but it\\'s unclear if it\\'s a security concern.\\n*   There was discussion about potentially moving all escaping to a single location (server-side or client-side) for better maintainability.\\n*   The risk rating was assessed as Medium.\\n*   The patch was backported and published.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '644', 'name': 'Improper Neutralization of HTTP Headers for Scripting Syntax', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes web scripting syntax in HTTP headers that can be used by web browser components that can process raw headers, such as Flash.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)', 'type': 'weakness'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(197.98328343557884)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '79', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:Input Validation vulnerability', 'keyphrase': 'Input Validation vulnerability', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'rootcause:Improper Input Validation', 'keyphrase': 'Improper Input Validation', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:The Wikimedia Foundation Mediawiki - Growth Experiments Extension', 'keyphrase': 'The Wikimedia Foundation Mediawiki - Growth Experiments Extension', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:1.39 through 1.43', 'keyphrase': '1.39 through 1.43', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(168.77939661074987)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
