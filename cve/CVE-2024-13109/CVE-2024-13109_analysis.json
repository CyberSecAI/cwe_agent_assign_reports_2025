  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Beijing Yunfan Internet Technology Yunfan Learning Examination System 1.9.2. It has been rated as critical. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /doc.html. The manipulation leads to **improper authorization**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability lies in the `ShiroConfig.java` file within the `yfexam-exam` project. Specifically, the `doc.html` path does not have access permissions set.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of access control on the `doc.html` endpoint. This allows unauthenticated users to access it.\n- **Interface Exposure:** The `doc.html` endpoint exposes all application interfaces.\n- **API documentation exposure:** The `/v2/api-docs` endpoint also lacks proper authentication, exposing API documentation\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can access the `doc.html` path without authentication and view the application's interfaces.\n- **Information Disclosure:** This can reveal sensitive information about the application's internal workings, API endpoints, and possibly data structures.\n- **Potential for further attacks:** Knowledge gained from the exposed interfaces could be used to plan further attacks on the system.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- **Direct HTTP Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by directly requesting the `doc.html` endpoint (`http://192.168.0.106:8101/doc.html`) or the `/v2/api-docs` endpoint without prior authentication.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application, specifically to the exposed `doc.html` and `/v2/api-docs` paths.\n- **No authentication needed**: The attacker does not need any authentication credentials to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The provided content includes links to images showing the exposed interface documentation and API documentation.\n- The vulnerability was identified in version 1.9.2 of `yfexam-exam`.\n- The vulnerability was reported in a GitHub issue.",

This CWE is appropriate because the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary show that authorization checks are missing. CWE-306 is a secondary candidate because the CVE summary indicates that authentication is also missing. Both CWE-862 and CWE-306 are children of higher-level classes related to access control.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of access control** on `/doc.html` and `/v2/api-docs` endpoints, which leads to **unauthorized access**, **information disclosure** and potentially further attacks.\n  - The root cause is the **improper authorization** and/or authentication checks.\n  - The impact is unauthorized access to sensitive information and potential for further attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description stating \"**improper authorization**,\" aligns with the CVE reference summary that reveals a **lack of access control** on the `/doc.html` endpoint. This evidence strongly supports CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization], as the application **does not check** whether the user is authorized to access the resource. Further the CVE reference summary indicates that authentication is also missing for the `/v2/api-docs` endpoint, suggesting CWE-306 [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function] as a secondary weakness because the product **does not perform any authentication**. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, providing the most specific classification possible based on the available evidence.\n\nThe primary evidence supporting CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization] is the \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** ...the `doc.html` path does not have access permissions set.\" and \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** ...lack of access control on the `doc.html` endpoint.\". This indicates a clear absence of authorization checks, directly aligning with the CWE description.\n\nThe secondary evidence supporting CWE-306 [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function] is the exposure of the `/v2/api-docs` endpoint without authentication.\n\nThe retriever results also support these findings, with CWE-306 [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function] and CWE-425 [CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')] being listed. The guidance on Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control also helped guide the decision.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-284 [CWE-284: Improper Access Control]: This is a high-level category and less specific than CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization].\n*   CWE-285 [CWE-285: Improper Authorization]: Similar to CWE-284 [CWE-284: Improper Access Control], this is less specific than CWE-862 [CWE-862: Missing Authorization] as it indicates an incorrect authorization check rather than a missing one.\n*   CWE-425 [CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')]: While this could be applicable, it's more of a consequence of the missing authorization rather than the root cause.\n*   CWE-863 [CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization]: This would apply if there was an authorization check that was implemented incorrectly.",
