# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-42069

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net mana Fix possible **double free** in error handling path When auxiliary_device_add() returns error and then calls auxiliary_device_uninit(), callback function adev_release calls kfree(madev). We shouldnt call kfree(madev) again in the error handling path. Set madev to NULL.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **double free**
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** auxiliary_device_add()

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to CVE-2024-42069, as it describes a fix for a double-free vulnerability in the `mana_en.c` driver within the Linux kernel.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is caused by a double free of the `madev` variable. This occurs in the error handling path of the `add_adev` function within the `mana_en.c` driver. Specifically, when `auxiliary_device_add()` returns an error, `auxiliary_device_uninit()` is called, which in turn calls the `adev_release` callback. This callback frees `madev`. However, in the original code, the error handling path would then *again* call `kfree(madev)`, resulting in a double free.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Double free vulnerability due to incorrect resource management in the error handling path.
*   Lack of proper checks to prevent the `madev` from being freed twice.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   A double-free can lead to memory corruption, which can potentially lead to system instability, crashes, or even arbitrary code execution in the kernel.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered during the initialization of the mana device, specifically if `auxiliary_device_add()` fails after `madev` is allocated.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to trigger the loading of the affected mana driver such that the `auxiliary_device_add` call fails.
*   This implies that the attacker would likely need to have some level of control over the system's hardware configuration or device loading process.

The patch addresses the issue by setting `madev` to `NULL` before calling `auxiliary_device_add`, ensuring that `kfree(madev)` is not called again in the error handling path after the `adev_release` callback has already freed it.
