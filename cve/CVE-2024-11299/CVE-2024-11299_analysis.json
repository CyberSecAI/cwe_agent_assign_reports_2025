The description highlights the impact as extracting sensitive data due to posts not being properly protected from unauthenticated users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the provided context. The core of the vulnerability is the **Sensitive Information Exposure**, which aligns well with `CWE-200`. The retriever results also list `CWE-200` as a high-scoring candidate. `CWE-862` is considered a secondary factor as a potential root cause that allows the **exposure** to occur.\n\nThe selection of `CWE-200` is justified by the explicit mention of \"**Sensitive Information Exposure**\" in the vulnerability description. `CWE-862` is also considered as a potential weakness, but the evidence for it is less direct.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request
