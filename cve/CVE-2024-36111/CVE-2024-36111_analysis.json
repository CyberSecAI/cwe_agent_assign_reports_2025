  "description": "KubePi is a K8s panel. Starting in version 1.6.3 and prior to version 1.8.0, there is a defect in the KubePi JWT token verification. The JWT key in the default configuration file is empty. Although a random 32-bit string will be generated to overwrite the key in the configuration file when the key is detected to be empty in the configuration file reading logic, the key is empty during actual verification. Using an empty key to generate a JWT token can bypass the login verification and directly take over the back end. Version 1.8.0 contains a patch for this issue.",

Although a random 32-character string is generated and written to the configuration file as a JWT secret key when the key is empty, the actual JWT verification process uses the initial empty string key from the configuration file instead of the generated key.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:\n    - JWT token verification bypass due to usage of empty key.\n    - Inconsistent use of JWT key generation and verification.\n    - Default empty JWT key in configuration file.\n- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass login authentication by generating a JWT token with an empty secret key, granting them full control of the backend. This allows for creating users and gaining unauthorized access.\n- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.",

CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is a related class-level CWE that describes the impact of the vulnerability. CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) is a child of CWE-287 and could be considered because the empty key can be seen as a hardcoded credential.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe287,cwe798 secondary\n    class cwe345 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **empty JWT key in the default configuration file**. This leads to **improper verification of the cryptographic signature** (CWE-347), which in turn allows an attacker to **bypass login verification** (CWE-287) and gain unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **improper verification of the cryptographic signature** (CWE-347) due to the use of an empty key. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section states that \"the actual JWT verification process uses the initial empty string key from the configuration file instead of the generated key.\" This directly supports CWE-347. The impact is that an attacker can bypass authentication, which aligns with CWE-287, but the root cause is the signature verification failure.\n\nCWE-287 was considered because the vulnerability ultimately allows an attacker to bypass authentication. However, the root cause is more specifically related to the cryptographic signature verification process. Therefore, CWE-347 is a more precise and appropriate classification.\n\nCWE-798 was considered since an empty key could be viewed as a hardcoded credential. However, the vulnerability lies more in the improper verification of the JWT signature, making CWE-347 the better choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed -
