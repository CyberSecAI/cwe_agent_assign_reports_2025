  "description": "Password Pusher is an open source application to communicate sensitive information over the web. A vulnerability has been reported in versions 1.50.3 and prior where an attacker can copy the session cookie before a user logs out, potentially allowing **session hijacking**. Although the session token is replaced and invalidated upon logout, if an attacker manages to capture the session cookie before this process, they can use the token to gain unauthorized access to the users session until the token expires or is manually cleared. This vulnerability hinges on the attackers ability to access the session cookie during an active session, either through a man-in-the-middle attack, by exploiting another vulnerability like **XSS**, or via direct access to the victims device. Although there is no direct resolution to this vulnerability, it is recommended to always use the latest version of Password Pusher to best mitigate risk. If self-hosting, ensure Password Pusher is hosted exclusively over SSL connections to encrypt traffic and prevent session cookies from being intercepted in transit. Additionally, implement best practices in local security to safeguard user systems, browsers, and data against unauthorized access.",

Although the session token is invalidated on logout, if captured beforehand, it remains valid until expiry or manual clearing.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Session token interception, potentially through man-in-the-middle attacks, XSS, or direct access to the victim's device.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to a user's session, allowing them to potentially perform actions as that user until the session expires or is manually cleared.\n- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, exploiting XSS vulnerabilities, or gaining direct access to the victim's device to copy the session cookie.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept or access the session cookie during an active user session. This could involve network interception (MitM), exploiting other vulnerabilities such as XSS, or direct access to the user's system. The attacker also needs high privileges according to the CVSS score.",

CWE-613 is a specific type of resource management issue that occurs due to **insufficient session expiration**, making it more appropriate than the more general CWE-672. CWE-319 is a peer relationship that also contributes to the overall vulnerability, but the vulnerability description does not indicate the root cause is due to transmission, but instead the session expiration.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe613[\"CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on a Resource after Expiry or Release\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe613 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe613 primary\n    class cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient session expiration** (CWE-613), which allows an attacker to potentially **hijack a session** by using a copied session cookie before the user logs out. If the session cookie is transmitted in cleartext, then **sensitive information** is also transmitted in cleartext (CWE-319). The **impact** of this chain is the **unauthorized access** to the user's session.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The description states that an attacker can copy the session cookie before a user logs out, potentially allowing **session hijacking**. Although the session token is replaced and invalidated upon logout, if an attacker manages to capture the session cookie before this process, they can use the token to gain unauthorized access to the users session until the token expires or is manually cleared. This points to a problem with session management, specifically related to the session's expiration.\n\nThe retriever results suggested several CWEs related to authentication, transmission of sensitive information, and cookie management. While these are related, they do not represent the core weakness. The best fit is CWE-613 (Insufficient Session Expiration), which directly addresses the issue of allowing an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs due to the session not expiring quickly enough. The evidence supporting this is the statement that the attacker can use the captured cookie until it expires.\n\nCWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) was considered as a secondary weakness because the vulnerability mentions that hosting Password Pusher over SSL connections can encrypt traffic and prevent session cookies from being intercepted in transit. This suggests that the transmission of the session cookie in cleartext is a contributing factor, but not the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence that the **session hijacking** is possible because the session does not expire quickly enough, allowing the attacker to reuse the captured cookie. This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-613.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
