## Analysis of CVE-2025-4180 Content (fitoxs.com_a094b76e_20250624_120607.html)

This content **RELATES** to a vulnerability in PCMan FTP Server. It provides details beyond what a standard CVE description would typically offer, detailing an exploit for a buffer overflow.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A buffer overflow exists in the `TRACE` command handling of PCMan FTP Server version 2.0.7.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Remote Buffer Overflow

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   The exploit allows for arbitrary code execution. The provided script attempts to execute a reverse shell.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Sending a crafted `TRACE` command to a vulnerable PCMan FTP Server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the target PCMan FTP Server. No authentication is required as the exploit uses anonymous login.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The content does not provide information on mitigation or fixes. It only details the exploit.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Software:** PCMan FTP Server 2.0.7
*   **Tested on:** Windows XP SP3 (Build 2600)
*   **Offset:** 2005 bytes
*   **EIP overwrite:** 0x74e32fd9 (JMP ESP)
*   **Bad characters:** `\x00\x0a\x0d`
*   **Payload:** The script constructs a payload containing an offset, EIP overwrite, NOP sled, and shellcode. The shellcode is generated using `msfvenom` to establish a reverse TCP connection to `192.168.176.136` on port `4444`.
*   **Exploit Script:** The provided Perl script connects to the FTP server, logs in anonymously, sends the crafted `TRACE` command with the payload, and then closes the connection.

**Note:** This content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, including the specific offset, EIP address, and a working exploit script.
