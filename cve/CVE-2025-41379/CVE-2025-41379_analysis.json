There are no parent-child or chain relationships to consider. The abstraction level is Base, which is desirable.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe772[\"CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe772 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect** assignment of IDs in the firewall rule creation process, leading to a situation where resources (firewall rules) cannot be deleted because the system attempts to release a resource using the **incorrect** ID. The root cause is the **failure** to properly manage the resource lifecycle.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the vulnerability's impact: the inability to delete firewall rules. The retriever results did not directly address the root cause. The analysis shifted to identifying the underlying coding error that led to this impact. CWE-772 [Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime] was chosen because it accurately describes the scenario where the system **fails** to properly release the firewall rule resource due to the ID mismatch.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
