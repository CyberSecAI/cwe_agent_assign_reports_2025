  "description": "Streamlit is a data oriented application development framework for python. Snowflake Streamlit open source addressed a security vulnerability via the static file sharing feature. Users of hosted Streamlit app(s) on Windows were vulnerable to a **path traversal vulnerability** when the static file sharing feature is enabled. An attacker could utilize the vulnerability to leak the password hash of the Windows user running Streamlit. The vulnerability was patched on Jul 25, 2024, as part of Streamlit open source version 1.37.0. The vulnerability only affects Windows.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of paths when serving static files in Streamlit on Windows. Specifically, a path traversal vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of the requested file paths against the allowed static file directory.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n- **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue. By crafting malicious file paths (e.g., using `../`), an attacker can access files outside the intended static file directory.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to leak sensitive information, such as the password hash of the Windows user running the Streamlit application.\n- **File Access:** This vulnerability allows access to arbitrary files on the server where the application is hosted, potentially leading to further malicious actions.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Network-based:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely by sending crafted HTTP requests to the Streamlit application.\n- **Specifically targets Windows:** This vulnerability is specific to the Windows OS.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the hosted Streamlit application.\n- **Low Privileges:** The attacker does not require high privileges to exploit this vulnerability, needing only the ability to send HTTP requests.\n- **Knowledge of static file serving mechanism:** The attacker needs to be aware that the static file sharing feature is enabled on the Streamlit instance.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n- The vulnerability is considered moderate in severity with a CVSS v3 base score of 5.9.\n- The vulnerability was fixed in Streamlit version 1.37.0, released on July 25, 2024.\n- The fix involves validating the path using Tornado before performing checks, ensuring that requested files are within the intended static file directory.\n- The patch also updated unit tests to include checks for 403 responses, which should be returned for invalid requests (e.g., directories, symlinks outside the allowed directory).\n- The vulnerability was reported via a bug bounty program.\n\n**Summary of Changes from Commit:**\n\nThe commit `3a639859cfdfba2187c81897d44a3e33825eb0a3` introduces the following key changes:\n\n- **`app_static_file_handler.py`:** Added validation using `os.path.realpath` to resolve the absolute path, prevents serving directories, and uses the parent class' `validate_absolute_path` after checks for directories\n- **`app_static_file_handler_test.py`**: Updated tests to reflect 403 errors for invalid requests and 404 for non existing files.",

This aligns with the description stating that an attacker could **access files outside the intended static file directory**. The subsequent impact, the **leak of the password hash**, supports the inclusion of CWE-497 as a secondary weakness, indicating the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nThe confidence in this assessment is high (0.9) because there is explicit evidence in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links.

        "extended_description": "\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n",
