  "query": "A vulnerability in the packet filtering features of Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass Layer 3 and Layer 4 traffic filters. This vulnerability is due to improper traffic filtering conditions on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted packet to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the Layer 3 and Layer 4 traffic filters and inject a crafted packet into the network.",
