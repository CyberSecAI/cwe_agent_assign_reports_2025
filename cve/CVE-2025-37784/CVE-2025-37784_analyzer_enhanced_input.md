## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net ti icss-iep Fix possible **NULL pointer dereference** for perout request The ICSS IEP driver tracks perout and pps enable state with flags. Currently when disabling pps and perout signals during icss_iep_exit(), results in **NULL pointer dereference** for perout. To fix the null pointer dereference issue, the icss_iep_perout_enable_hw function can be modified to directly clear the IEP CMP registers when disabling PPS or PEROUT, without referencing the ptp_perout_request structure, as its contents are irrelevant in this case.
