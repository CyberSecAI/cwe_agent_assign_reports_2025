## Vulnerability Description
The Oz Forensics face recognition application before 4.0.8 late 2023 allows PII retrieval via /statistic/list **Insecure Direct Object Reference**. NOTE the number 4.0.8 was used for both the unpatched and patched versions.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Insecure Direct Object Reference**
- **impact:** PII retrieval
- **product:** Oz Forensics face recognition application
- **version:** before 4.0.8 late 2023
- **component:** /statistic/list

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```text
The provided content from medium.com discusses an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability (CVE-2025-32367) in the OZ Forensics face recognition application. The vulnerability is present in the `/statistic/list` API endpoint.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The API endpoint `GET /statistic/list` was publicly accessible and returned a complete JSON list of URLs to sensitive data, bypassing any obscurity-based protection.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR). The API endpoint exposed sensitive data without proper access controls.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Identity theft
    *   Biometric model training without user consent
    *   Cross-platform user profiling using facial and ID data
    *   Regulatory violations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA)
    *   Reputational damage
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker could simply send a request to the `GET /statistic/list` endpoint and receive a list of all available data.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needed network access to the vulnerable API endpoint. No authentication was required.
*   **Mitigation or fix:**
    *   Enforce Authentication and Authorization: Restrict access to the `/statistic/list` endpoint by requiring strong, authenticated user sessions. Ensure that only authorized users can access data relevant to their own accounts (i.e., apply object-level access controls).
    *   Disable or Remove the Endpoint: If not strictly necessary for functionality, the `/statistic/list` endpoint should be removed or disabled altogether.
*   **More detail than CVE description:** The content provides a detailed technical analysis of the vulnerability, including the endpoint, the data exposed, the CVSS score, the discovery timeline, and a proof-of-concept exploit. It also gives clear recommendations for mitigation and incident detection guidance.
