  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved tracing fprobe events Fix possible UAF on modules Commit ac91052f0ae5 (tracing tprobe-events Fix leakage of module refcount) moved try_module_get() from __find_tracepoint_module_cb() to find_tracepoint() caller, but that introduced a possible UAF because the module can be unloaded before try_module_get(). In this case, the module object should be freed too. Thus, try_module_get() does not only fail but may access to the freed object. To avoid that, try_module_get() in __find_tracepoint_module_cb() again.",
