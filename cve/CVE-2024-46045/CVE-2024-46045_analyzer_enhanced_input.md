## Vulnerability Description
Tenda CH22 V1.0.0.6(468) has a **stack overflow** vulnerability located in the frmL7PlotForm function.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack overflow**
- **product:** Tenda CH22
- **version:** V1.0.0.6(468)
- **component:** frmL7PlotForm function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the `frmL7PlotForm` function of the Tenda CH22 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `sprintf` function is used to format a string into a buffer, and the size of the destination buffer `s` is insufficient to accommodate user-supplied input via the `page` parameter from a POST request.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to the stack overflow, potentially crashing the device or enabling arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/frmL7ProtForm` endpoint. The `page` parameter within the request contains excessive data to cause the overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the device to send the malicious HTTP POST request.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint of the router, which appears to be publicly known.
- No authentication is mentioned, so it is possible that no authentication is needed.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `frmL7PlotForm` function which receives the `page` parameter.
- The vulnerable statement is `v1 = sprintf(s, "im.asp?page=%s", v6);`.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates a method to trigger the overflow using a Python script with `requests` and `pwn` libraries.
- The vulnerable firmware version is CH22 V1.0.0.6(468).
- A firmware download link is provided: <https://www.tenda.com.cn/download/detail-2230.html>
