## Vulnerability Description
Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. This report details a security vulnerability in Argo CD, where an unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted large JSON payload to the /api/webhook endpoint, causing excessive memory allocation that leads to service disruption by triggering an Out Of Memory (OOM) kill. The issue poses a high risk to the availability of Argo CD deployments. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.11.6, 2.10.15, and 2.9.20.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** availability and service disruption
- **vector:** specially crafted large JSON payload
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attacker
- **product:** Argo CD
- **component:** /api/webhook endpoint

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of a limit on the size of the JSON payload that can be sent to the `/api/webhook` endpoint in Argo CD. This allows an attacker to send an arbitrarily large payload, causing excessive memory allocation by the `argocd-server` component during parsing, leading to an Out-of-Memory (OOM) kill and service disruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The `/api/webhook` endpoint does not require authentication by default, allowing unauthenticated users to send malicious requests.
- **Lack of Payload Size Limit:** There was no enforced limit on the size of the request payload being parsed.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** The vulnerability allows for an unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial-of-service by exhausting server resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in the `argocd-server` component being OOMKilled, rendering Argo CD unavailable.
- **Service Disruption:** The OOM kill leads to significant service disruption affecting any applications managed by Argo CD

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based Attack:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request with a large JSON payload to the `/api/webhook` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Argo CD server.
- **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication or privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Crafting Payload:** The attacker must be capable of creating a large JSON payload.

**Additional Details from the provided content**
- **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided PoC code demonstrates how to generate and send a large JSON payload to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Patch:** The vulnerability was patched by implementing a limit on the size of the request being parsed. The fix is implemented in the following Argo CD versions: v2.11.6, v2.10.15, and v2.9.20
- **Mitigation:** The fix for this vulnerability limits the maximum size of the payload that can be sent to the webhook server, configurable via the `webhook.maxPayloadSizeMB` attribute in the `argocd-cm` ConfigMap. The default value is 1GB. This limits the impact an attacker could have on resources via a large payload.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5, categorized as high severity.
- **CWE:** The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption).
