  "description": "A vulnerability was found in EnGenius ENH1350EXT, ENS500-AC and ENS620EXT up to 20241118. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /admin/network/diag_traceroute. The manipulation of the argument diag_traceroute leads to **command injection**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `diag_traceroute` parameter in the `/admin/network/diag_traceroute` interface of ENGENIUS routers is vulnerable to command injection. The user-supplied value for `diag_traceroute` is directly passed to the `diag_command` function without sanitization, allowing arbitrary commands to be executed.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the web server, potentially gaining complete control of the device.\n- **Attack vectors:** HTTP GET request to the `/cgi-bin/luci/.../admin/network/diag_traceroute/` endpoint with a crafted `diag_traceroute` parameter containing shell commands.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n    - The attacker needs to be able to access the web interface of the router.\n    - The attacker must be logged into the device as an administrator to access the vulnerable interface.\n    - The attacker can inject commands by crafting an HTTP request with a malicious `diag_traceroute` parameter.",

CWE-78 is a specific type of CWE-77, focusing on OS command injection. Because the vulnerability specifically involves the execution of OS commands, CWE-78 is more appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of the `diag_traceroute` input, leading to **command injection**, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified a **command injection** vulnerability. The evidence from the CVE description and the reference links content summary clearly indicates that the `diag_traceroute` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands. The retriever results also highlighted CWE-77 and CWE-78 as potential candidates.
