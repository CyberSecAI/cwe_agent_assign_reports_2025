  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-44881 Content\n\nThe provided content **relates** to a remote command execution vulnerability in the `qos.cgi` script of the wavlink-WL-WN579A3 device. It provides significantly more detail than a standard CVE description would.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nA command injection vulnerability exists because the `qos.cgi` script executes a system function with a concatenated string (`byte_417C84`) that is controllable by the user through the `qos_bandwidth` parameter.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Command Injection\n*   Unsafe use of system() function\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Arbitrary command execution\n*   Potential for information disclosure\n*   Potential for system compromise\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   HTTP POST request to `./etc/lighttpd/www/cgi-bin/qos.cgi`\n*   Specifically, manipulating the `qos_bandwidth` parameter.\n*   Requires setting specific HTTP headers: `HTTP_REFERER=wifi.wavlink.com` and `HTTP_COOKIE=session=1111111111111`\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Network access to the device's web interface.\n*   Ability to craft and send HTTP POST requests.\n*   No authentication appears to be required beyond the cookie and referer header.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not specify a fix, but implies that proper input validation and sanitization of the `qos_bandwidth` parameter before passing it to the `system()` function is necessary. Avoiding the use of `system()` altogether would be a more secure approach.\n\n**Exploit Details:**\n\n*   The exploit uses the `page=qos&sel_qos=1&qos_bandwidth=;ls;,1` payload.\n*   The exploit is tested within a chrooted QEMU environment.\n*   The resulting command executed is: `qos_script.sh mode_setup 1 ; ls; 1>/dev/null 2>&1`",

The root cause is the **improper neutralization** of special elements in the `qos_bandwidth` parameter, which allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the system.
