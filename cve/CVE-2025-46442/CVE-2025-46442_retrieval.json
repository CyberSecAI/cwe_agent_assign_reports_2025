It provides details about a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the WordPress Loan Calculator Plugin.\\n\\nHere\\'s an extraction of the relevant information:\\n\\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).\\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability allows a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions.\\n*   **Impact of exploitation:**  A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The impact varies case by case.\\n*   **Attack vectors:** The content does not specify the exact attack vector, but CSRF generally involves tricking a logged-in user into submitting a malicious request.\\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Unauthenticated attacker.\\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** No official fix is available as of April 24, 2025. Patchstack offers \"vPatching\" as a mitigation.\\n*   **Affected versions:** <= 1.3\\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.1 (Low severity)\\n*   **OWASP Top 10:** A3: Injection (Note: This seems incorrect for a CSRF vulnerability, it should be A7:2021 - Server Side Request Forgery)\\n\\n**More detail than official CVE description:** The content provides a CVSS score, affected versions, and information about Patchstack\\'s vPatching solution, which is more detail than a typical CVE description would offer.
