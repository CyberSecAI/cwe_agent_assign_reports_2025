# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-4941

# Vulnerability Description

    A ****local file inclusion** vulnerability** exists in the JSON component of gradio-app/gradio version 4.25. The vulnerability arises from **improper input validation** in the `postprocess()` function within `gradio/components/json_component.py`, where a user-controlled string is parsed as JSON. If the parsed JSON object contains a `path` key, the specified file is moved to a temporary directory, making it possible to retrieve it later via the `/file=..` endpoint. This issue is due to the `processing_utils.move_files_to_cache()` function traversing any object passed to it, looking for a dictionary with a `path` key, and then copying the specified file to a temporary directory. The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to read files on the remote system, posing a significant security risk.
