However, since the description mentions \"**improper access controls**\" as the root cause, CWE-284 is selected as the primary, with CWE-425 as a secondary candidate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    \n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access controls** (CWE-284), leading to the ability of an unauthenticated attacker to send a specific web request (/goform/ate) to enable a remote system management binary (ate). The direct consequence is enabling unauthorized functionality. CWE-425 can be considered because the attacker is directly requesting a resource without proper authorization checks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-284 as a strong candidate due to the explicit mention of \"**improper access controls**\" in the vulnerability description. The Retriever results also listed CWE-284 and CWE-425 as potential matches, with CWE-425, Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'), being a more specific instance of an access control bypass.\n\nCWE-284 is chosen as the primary weakness, acknowledging that it's a higher-level category. CWE-425 is added as a secondary weakness to provide more context to the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially
