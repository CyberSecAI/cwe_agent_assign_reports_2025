## Vulnerability Description
An issue in Ellevo v.6.2.0.38160 allows a remote attacker to escalate privileges via the /api/usuario/cadastrodesuplente endpoint.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** escalate privileges
- **attacker:** remote attacker
- **product:** Ellevo
- **version:** v.6.2.0.38160
- **component:** /api/usuario/cadastrodesuplente endpoint

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Ellevo call tracking platform allows users to bypass manager approval controls by defining themselves as their own substitute approver. This is due to a flaw in the substitute registration endpoint of the application's API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Broken Functionality Level Authorization (BFLA):** The application fails to properly validate user privileges, allowing users to access and modify functionalities they shouldn't be authorized to use.
*   **Insecure API Endpoint:** The substitute registration API endpoint does not properly restrict the ability of a user to set themselves as a substitute approver.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:**  The API allows any user to set any substitute, including themselves, for any other user, without proper checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Users can approve their own tickets, bypassing the intended approval process by managers or supervisors.
*   This can lead to unauthorized changes, approvals, or closure of tickets without proper oversight or authorization.
*   Compromise of the integrity of the ticket management system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Manipulation:** The attacker directly interacts with the application's API to manipulate substitute assignments.
*   The attacker leverages an authenticated session on the platform.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the Ellevo platform.
*   **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs knowledge of the specific API endpoint for substitute registration.
*   **Ability to Manipulate API:** The attacker needs the ability to send API requests to the substitute registration endpoint.

**Steps to Reproduce (from the provided content):**

1.  Identify the login of the default approver for a ticket.
2.  Manipulate the API endpoint to set the attacker's login as a substitute for the default approver.
3.  Set a start and end date for the substitution.
4.  Open the ticket, which will then be automatically approved by the attacker's user due to being a substitute.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability is present in version 6.2.0.38160 of the software.
* The attack can be carried out by authenticated users of the platform by using the described API manipulation.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| “Escalate to root/admin”                    | Privilege escalation impact           | Not CWE-269! Use root cause (e.g., 266, 250) |
| “Assigned wrong role/group”                 | Misassigned privilege                 | CWE-266                                      |

| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
