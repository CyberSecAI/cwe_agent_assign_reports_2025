  "description": "A vulnerability in the SSH subsystem of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute operating system commands as root. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted input when executing remote CLI commands over SSH. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands on the underlying operating system with root-level privileges. An attacker with limited user privileges could use this vulnerability to gain complete control over the system.",

CWE-20 [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation] can precede CWE-78, as **improper input validation** can lead to command injection. Selecting CWE-78 provides more specific details about the vulnerability than using the more general CWE-20.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe78\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n    class cwe74 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient input validation** (CWE-20), which allows an attacker to inject special elements into an OS command (CWE-78), leading to the execution of arbitrary commands with root privileges.\n  - The **Primary CWE** should identify the issue that led to the vulnerability i.e. the first in the \"Vulnerability Chain\"\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the **root cause** is **insufficient input validation**, which allows an authenticated, remote attacker to execute OS commands as root. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, highlighting the **insufficient input validation** and command injection as key weaknesses.\n\nThe retriever results list CWE-20 [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation] and CWE-78 [CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')] as highly relevant. While **improper input validation** is the **root cause**, the direct consequence and exploitability stem from the ability to inject OS commands. Therefore, CWE-78 [CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')] is chosen as the primary CWE because it more precisely describes the vulnerability. CWE-20 [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation] is chosen as a secondary CWE.\n\nThe selection of CWE-78 [CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')] is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the command injection aspect of the vulnerability. While CWE-20 [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation] is relevant, it is a more general weakness, and CWE-78 [CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')] provides a more precise description of the exploit.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
