# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-7426

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-7426

## Description

The Community by PeepSo - Social Network, Membership, Registration, User Profiles plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.6.0. This is due to the plugin displaying errors and allowing direct access to the sse.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Impact:** Full Path Disclosure
- **Attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **Product:** ['The Community by PeepSo - Social Network', 'Membership', 'Registration', 'User Profiles plugin for WordPress']
- **Version:** ['all versions up to', 'and including', '6.4.6.0']
- **Component:** sse.php file

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE identified is CWE-200, which is a Class-level CWE. While it's generally discouraged to map directly to Class-level CWEs, in this case, it accurately reflects the vulnerability: the exposure of sensitive information (full path) to an unauthorized actor (unauthenticated attacker). The other CWEs listed are not as relevant, and I have selected the best fit that captures the essence of the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is relatively simple:
1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper error handling and direct access** to `sse.php` file without authentication.
2.  **Weakness:** Full Path Disclosure
3.  **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information that can aid other attacks

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis, based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference, indicates that the root cause of the vulnerability is the **exposure of the full path** due to **improper error handling** and allowing direct access to the `sse.php` file. The primary weakness is the full path disclosure, which can aid attackers in further attacks.

The selection of CWE-200 is based on the fact that the vulnerability leads to the **exposure of sensitive information** (the full path of the web application) to an **unauthorized actor** (unauthenticated attackers). Although CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE and is generally discouraged, it is the most appropriate in this context.

The description explicitly states "This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application". This directly supports the selection of CWE-200.

I considered CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function), CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')), but these options address the missing authentication/authorization, not the exposure of information.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense
