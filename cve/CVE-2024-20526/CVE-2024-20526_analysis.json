  "description": "A vulnerability in the SSH server of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition for the SSH server of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to a **logic error** when an SSH session is established. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SSH messages to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust available SSH resources on the affected device so that new SSH connections to the device are denied, resulting in a DoS condition. Existing SSH connections to the device would continue to function normally. The device must be rebooted manually to recover. However, user traffic would not be impacted and could be managed using a remote application such as Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM).",

  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A logic error occurs when an SSH session is established on Cisco ASA Software.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the SSH server implementation of Cisco ASA software when handling crafted SSH messages. Specifically, it's a resource exhaustion issue due to the logic flaw.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the SSH server. This prevents new SSH connections to the device, though existing connections remain functional. The device requires a manual reboot to recover the SSH service. User traffic isn't impacted, and remote management using applications such as Cisco ASDM remains possible.\n- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited remotely by sending specially crafted SSH messages to the affected device.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the SSH port on a vulnerable Cisco ASA device. No authentication is required.",

While CWE-400 [Uncontrolled Resource Consumption] is a Class-level CWE, it directly reflects the observed behavior of the vulnerability: the SSH server's resources are exhausted. CWE-755 [Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions] is also a Class, and relates to the **logic error**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe755[\"CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe755 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **logic error** in the SSH session establishment process. This **logic error** leads to the **uncontrolled consumption of resources**, eventually causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the SSH server.\n\nLogic Error -> Uncontrolled Resource Consumption -> Denial of Service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting impact. The vulnerability description clearly indicates a **logic error** as the root cause and a denial-of-service condition due to resource exhaustion as the impact.\n\nThe selection of CWE-400 [Uncontrolled Resource Consumption] is based on the fact that the attacker can exhaust SSH resources, preventing new connections. This aligns with the description of CWE-400, which states that the product \"does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\"\n\nThe inclusion of CWE-755 [Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions] acknowledges the presence of a **logic error** that isn't properly managed, leading to the resource exhaustion.\n\nThe CWEs selected are at the class level due to the lack of specific information to pinpoint a more precise base or variant CWE. However, they adequately represent the **root cause** and impact of the vulnerability based on the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
