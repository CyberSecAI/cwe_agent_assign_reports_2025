This vulnerability is triggered by uploading a dangerous file type (SVG), which leads to the execution of arbitrary web scripts. CWE-434 is also considered because the vulnerability involves unrestricted file uploads of dangerous types.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe434\n    cwe79 -->|PEEROF| cwe116\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe434 secondary\n    class cwe116 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the unrestricted upload of a dangerous file (SVG), represented by CWE-434. The **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** (root cause) leads to the injection of arbitrary web scripts when the SVG file is accessed, which is represented by CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the Booster for WooCommerce plugin is vulnerable to **Stored Cross-Site Scripting** due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** when handling SVG file uploads. This aligns directly with CWE-79, as the input (SVG file content) is not properly neutralized before being used in a web page, allowing for the execution of arbitrary web scripts. The retriever results also indicate CWE-79 as a relevant candidate.\n\nCWE-434 is also relevant because the vulnerability depends on the ability to upload a file with a dangerous type (SVG). However, the primary issue is the lack of sanitization of the file's content, which leads to the XSS vulnerability.\n\nCWE-116, Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output, was considered but not selected as the primary CWE because the description emphasizes the lack of sanitization, which is more directly related to neutralization than encoding or escaping. While encoding/escaping could be a mitigation, the root cause is the **insufficient input sanitization**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-79 is based on its precise match with the vulnerability's root cause and the provided evidence. The relationship analysis further supports this decision by showing how CWE-79 can lead to other vulnerabilities when combined with other weaknesses.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
