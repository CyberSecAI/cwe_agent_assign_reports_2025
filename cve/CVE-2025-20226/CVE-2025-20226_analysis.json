However, given the available information, CWE-863 provides the most accurate representation of the **incorrect authorization** issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe942[\"CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains\"]\n\n    cwe942 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe200 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n    class cwe942 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect authorization** check (CWE-863), which allows a low-privileged user to **bypass SPL safeguards** and execute risky commands. This leads to the exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200) that the user should not have access to.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary, which highlights the **bypass of SPL safeguards** for risky commands. The vulnerability description states that \"a low-privileged user that does not hold the admin or power Splunk roles could run a saved search with a risky command using the permissions of a higher-privileged user to **bypass the SPL safeguards**\". This directly indicates an authorization issue, aligning with CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). The CVE reference summary further supports this by stating, \"A low-privileged user can run a saved search with a risky command using the permissions of a higher-privileged user due to a **bypass of SPL safeguards**\".\n\nThe relationship graph influenced the selection by illustrating the connection between authorization and information exposure. While CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information) is a consequence of the **authorization** failure, the root cause lies in the **incorrect authorization** mechanism (CWE-863).\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-863 capturing the core **authorization** flaw and CWE-200 highlighting the resulting information exposure.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
