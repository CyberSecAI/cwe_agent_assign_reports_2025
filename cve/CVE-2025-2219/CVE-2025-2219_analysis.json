  "description": "A vulnerability was found in LoveCards LoveCardsV2 up to 2.3.2 and classified as critical. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /api/upload/image. The manipulation of the argument file leads to unrestricted upload. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
