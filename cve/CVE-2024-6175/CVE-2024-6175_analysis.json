  "description": "The Booking Ultra Pro Appointments Booking Calendar Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a **missing capability check** on the multiple functions in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.13. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to modify and delete. multiple plugin options and data such as payments, pricing, booking information, business hours, calendars, profile information, and email templates.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the Booking Ultra Pro Appointments Booking Calendar Plugin for WordPress. Specifically, multiple AJAX functions, such as `save_fields_settings`, `bup_delete_user_avatar`, and `bup_crop_avatar_user_profile_image`, lack proper capability checks.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Missing Authorization:** The primary weakness is the absence of capability checks on AJAX functions, allowing unauthorized users to access and modify plugin settings.\n- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** Although not explicitly stated, the ability to modify data via AJAX requests without proper authorization suggests that the AJAX endpoints are vulnerable to insecure direct object references.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Data Modification:** Authenticated attackers (Subscriber level and above) can modify various plugin options and data, including:\n    - Payment settings\n    - Pricing information\n    - Booking details\n    - Business hours\n    - Calendars\n    - Profile information\n    - Email templates\n- **Data Deletion:** Attackers can delete data, such as user avatars.\n- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Modifying sensitive settings could potentially lead to further exploitation or compromise of the site.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.\n- **AJAX Requests:** Attackers send crafted AJAX requests to vulnerable functions to modify plugin settings.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a WordPress user with at least Subscriber-level privileges.\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerability is present in all versions up to and including 1.1.13 of the plugin.\n- Version 1.1.14 patches this vulnerability.\n- The Wordfence article provides more details than the original CVE description.",

The more specific Base-level CWEs like CWE-639 **Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key** and CWE-425 **Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')** are considered as secondary CWEs to provide additional context. CWE-425 is a child of CWE-862, further solidifying its relevance.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    \n    cwe639 -->|PEEROF| cwe862\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe639,cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing capability check** (CWE-862). This leads to an **authorization bypass** (CWE-639), which ultimately enables unauthorized modification of data and deletion of data such as payments, pricing, booking information, business hours, calendars, profile information, and email templates. The ability to directly request resources without proper authorization is represented by CWE-425.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of a **missing capability check** in the vulnerability description. This is further supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which emphasizes the absence of capability checks on AJAX functions.\n\nThe retriever results also highlight CWE-862 as the top candidate. While CWE-863 **Incorrect Authorization** was also considered, the description clearly indicates that authorization checks are missing, not incorrectly implemented. CWE-639 and CWE-425 were included to provide a more complete picture of the authorization bypass and direct access aspects of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is at the Class level because it is the most accurate high-level description of the vulnerability and the more specific subtypes like CWE-639 and CWE-425 are included as secondary weaknesses. The evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the vulnerability is rooted in a **missing capability check**, making CWE-862 the most appropriate primary classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
