  "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Common Services Platform Collector (CSPC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct **cross-site scripting** (XSS) attacks against a user of the interface. This vulnerability is due to **insufficient validation of user-supplied input** by the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have at least a low-privileged account on an affected device. Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",

CWE-79 is a specific type of **improper input validation** that occurs during web page generation, leading to **cross-site scripting**. While **improper input validation** is the root cause, the specific manifestation is XSS. The other potential CWEs were either too broad (e.g., CWE-138) or focused on different attack vectors (e.g., CWE-78, CWE-22). The abstraction levels were also considered, with the Base level of CWE-79 being more appropriate than the Class level of CWE-20 as the primary mapping.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient validation of user-supplied input** (CWE-20) which leads to the ability to inject malicious code, ultimately resulting in **cross-site scripting** (CWE-79). The chain is:\n1.  **Improper Input Validation** (CWE-20) - The root cause.\n2.  **Cross-site Scripting** (CWE-79) - The exploitable weakness.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**insufficient validation of user-supplied input**\" and \"**cross-site scripting** (XSS) attacks\". The CVE reference links content summary reinforces this by highlighting \"**insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface**\" as the root cause and \"**Cross-Site Scripting** (XSS)\" as the resulting weakness.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision by highlighting the parent-child relationship between CWE-20 and CWE-79. While CWE-20 represents the root cause, CWE-79 more accurately describes the specific vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-79 directly addresses the type of vulnerability (XSS), and CWE-20 captures the more general root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because it is a variant of CWE-79 and less descriptive of the overall vulnerability.*\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because it describes information exposure but the primary vulnerability is XSS.*\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because it is too abstract and doesn't directly relate to XSS.*\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because CWE-79 describes the specific type of injection in this case, which is XSS.*\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This CWE was not selected because it's more about encoding issues and not directly about the input validation leading to XSS.*\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n*This CWE was not selected because it is not specific to XSS.*\n\n## CWE-923:",
