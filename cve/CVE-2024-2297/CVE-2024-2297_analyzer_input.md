# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-2297

## Vulnerability Description
The Bricks theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.6.1. This is due to **insufficient validation checks** placed on the create_autosave AJAX function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to execute arbitrary PHP code with elevated (administrator-level) privileges. NOTE Successful exploitation requires (1) the Bricks Builder to be enabled for posts (2) Builder access to be enabled for contributor-level users, and (3) Code Execution to be enabled for administrator-level users within the themes settings.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient validation checks**
- **impact:** Privilege Escalation
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers
- **product:** Bricks theme for WordPress
- **version:** all versions up to and including 1.9.6.1
- **component:** create_autosave AJAX function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2024-2297 Content

The provided content relates to security updates for Bricks Builder, specifically version 1.9.7. It details addressing a vulnerability and implementing several security enhancements.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The content doesn't explicitly state the root cause of the initial vulnerability addressed by 1.9.6.1, only that it was a code execution issue. However, it implies the core problem was unrestricted code execution within Bricks Builder.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unrestricted Code Execution:** Prior to 1.9.7, code execution was enabled by default, allowing potentially malicious code to be executed.
*   **Lack of Code Integrity Verification:**  There was no mechanism to verify the integrity of executed code, making it susceptible to tampering.
*   **Unvalidated Dynamic Function Calls:** The "echo" tag allowed calling functions without a whitelist, potentially leading to arbitrary function execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**

The impact of exploitation was code execution on the server, potentially allowing attackers to compromise the website.

**Attack vectors:**

The content doesn't detail specific attack vectors, but they would involve exploiting the unrestricted code execution capabilities through:

*   Code elements with "Execute code" enabled.
*   SVG elements with "Source" set to "Code".
*   Query editor instances.
*   Dynamic "echo" tags.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

The content mentions a smaller authenticated issue requiring a "contributor role or above, bad intentions, and a code execute user" to perform additional steps. This suggests a logged-in attacker with some level of access was needed.

**Mitigation or fix:**

Bricks 1.9.7 introduces the following mitigations:

1.  **Disabled Code Execution by Default:** Code execution is now disabled unless explicitly enabled.
2.  **Code Signatures:** Executable code must be signed by a user with full builder access and code execution capability.
3.  **Code Review:** A feature to review all executable code on the site.
4.  **Echo Tag Function Filter:**  All functions called through the dynamic "echo" tag must be explicitly whitelisted.

**More detail than official CVE description:**

Yes, the content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It outlines the specific changes made to address the vulnerability, the new security features implemented, and provides links to documentation for further information. It also details the steps required to update and configure the new security features.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
