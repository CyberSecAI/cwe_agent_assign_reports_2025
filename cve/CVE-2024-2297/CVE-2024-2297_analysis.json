  "description": "The Bricks theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.6.1. This is due to **insufficient validation checks** placed on the create_autosave AJAX function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to execute arbitrary PHP code with elevated (administrator-level) privileges. NOTE Successful exploitation requires (1) the Bricks Builder to be enabled for posts (2) Builder access to be enabled for contributor-level users, and (3) Code Execution to be enabled for administrator-level users within the themes settings.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2024-2297 Content\n\nThe provided content relates to security updates for Bricks Builder, specifically version 1.9.7. It details addressing a vulnerability and implementing several security enhancements.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe content doesn't explicitly state the root cause of the initial vulnerability addressed by 1.9.6.1, only that it was a code execution issue. However, it implies the core problem was unrestricted code execution within Bricks Builder.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Unrestricted Code Execution:** Prior to 1.9.7, code execution was enabled by default, allowing potentially malicious code to be executed.\n*   **Lack of Code Integrity Verification:**  There was no mechanism to verify the integrity of executed code, making it susceptible to tampering.\n*   **Unvalidated Dynamic Function Calls:** The \"echo\" tag allowed calling functions without a whitelist, potentially leading to arbitrary function execution.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nThe impact of exploitation was code execution on the server, potentially allowing attackers to compromise the website.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nThe content doesn't detail specific attack vectors, but they would involve exploiting the unrestricted code execution capabilities through:\n\n*   Code elements with \"Execute code\" enabled.\n*   SVG elements with \"Source\" set to \"Code\".\n*   Query editor instances.\n*   Dynamic \"echo\" tags.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\nThe content mentions a smaller authenticated issue requiring a \"contributor role or above, bad intentions, and a code execute user\" to perform additional steps. This suggests a logged-in attacker with some level of access was needed.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nBricks 1.9.7 introduces the following mitigations:\n\n1.  **Disabled Code Execution by Default:** Code execution is now disabled unless explicitly enabled.\n2.  **Code Signatures:** Executable code must be signed by a user with full builder access and code execution capability.\n3.  **Code Review:** A feature to review all executable code on the site.\n4.  **Echo Tag Function Filter:**  All functions called through the dynamic \"echo\" tag must be explicitly whitelisted.\n\n**More detail than official CVE description:**\n\nYes, the content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It outlines the specific changes made to address the vulnerability, the new security features implemented, and provides links to documentation for further information. It also details the steps required to update and configure the new security features.",

Given the vulnerability description, the authorization was performed, but incorrectly allowing privilege escalation, making CWE-863 the most fitting. The retriever results also indicated several related CWEs such as CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment), which could be a more specific child if the root cause was specifically related to privilege assignment.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe266 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe266 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient validation checks** on the `create_autosave` AJAX function. This leads to **Incorrect Authorization** (CWE-863), which then results in Privilege Escalation, allowing authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code with elevated privileges.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **insufficient validation checks** as the root cause leading to privilege escalation. The retriever results suggested CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) as potential candidates.\n\nThe decision to choose CWE-863 as the primary CWE is based on the fact that the authorization check was present but flawed, leading to the privilege escalation. If the authorization check was completely missing, then CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) would be more appropriate. Since there was an authorization check, but it was **insufficient**, CWE-863 is more appropriate.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description includes:\n\"This is due to **insufficient validation checks** placed on the create_autosave AJAX function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to execute arbitrary PHP code with elevated (administrator-level) privileges.\"\n\nCWE-266 was considered as a secondary candidate because the vulnerability ultimately results in incorrect privilege assignment.
