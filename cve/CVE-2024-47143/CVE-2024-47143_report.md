# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-47143

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved **dma-debug fix a possible **deadlock**** on radix_lock radix_lock() shouldnt be held while holding dma_hash_entry[idx].lock otherwise, theres a possible **deadlock** scenario when dma debug API is called holding rq_lock() CPU0 CPU1 CPU2 dma_free_attrs() check_unmap() add_dma_entry() __schedule() //out (A) rq_lock() get_hash_bucket() (A) dma_entry_hash check_sync() (A) radix_lock() (W) dma_entry_hash dma_entry_free() (W) radix_lock() // CPU2s one (W) rq_lock() CPU1 situation can happen when it extending radix tree and it tries to wake up kswapd via wake_all_kswapd(). CPU2 situation can happen while perf_event_task_sched_out() (i.e. dma sync operation is called while deleting perf_event using etm and etr tmc which are Arm Coresight hwtracing driver backends). To remove this possible situation, call dma_entry_free() after put_hash_bucket() in check_unmap().

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** dma-debug fix a possible deadlock
- **Weakness:** deadlock

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-833 | Deadlock | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **deadlock** scenario. |
| CWE-667 | Improper Locking | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE. This is a potential cause of the **deadlock**. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-833 (Deadlock), which is a Base level CWE. A possible cause of the deadlock is CWE-667 (Improper Locking), which is a Class level CWE. CWE-833 is a child of CWE-662 (Improper Synchronization), which in turn is a child of the Pillar CWE-662. CWE-667 is also a child of CWE-662.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper locking** (CWE-667), which leads to a **deadlock** (CWE-833). The root cause is the **improper locking** mechanism that leads to the **deadlock** state.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **deadlock** scenario, making CWE-833 the most appropriate primary CWE. The description also implies that this **deadlock** is caused by **improper locking**, which makes CWE-667 a relevant secondary CWE.

The evidence for CWE-833 is very strong: "dma-debug fix a possible **deadlock**" and "otherwise, theres a possible **deadlock** scenario".

CWE-667 is chosen as a secondary CWE because **improper locking** often leads to **deadlocks**.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-833 is a Base level CWE, which is preferred over Class or Pillar level CWEs. CWE-667 is a Class level CWE, but there are no more specific Base or Variant level CWEs that are applicable.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-833: Deadlock
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in **deadlock**.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not lock or does not correctly lock a resource when the product must have exclusive access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.

## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions

The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not initialize a critical resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
