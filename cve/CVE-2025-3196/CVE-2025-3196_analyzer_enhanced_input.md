## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. Affected is the function AssimpMD2ImporterInternReadFile in the library code/AssetLib/MD2/MD2Loader.cpp of the component Malformed File Handler. The manipulation of the argument Name leads to **stack-based buffer overflow**. The attack needs to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-3196 Content

The provided content relates to CVE-2025-3196. It details a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `Assimp::MD2Importer::InternReadFile` function of the Assimp library. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of bounds checking on the `iLen` variable before calling `memcpy`. This allows a write operation to occur beyond the allocated memory buffer, specifically `szString.data`. The generation process of `pcSkins->name` may also contribute by not truncating strings correctly, leading to a larger-than-expected `iLen` value.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code doesn't validate the length of the input string (`pcSkins->name`) before copying it into a fixed-size buffer on the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Application Crash:** The out-of-bounds write can lead to a segmentation fault and application crash.
*   **Potential for Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, a stack buffer overflow can potentially be exploited for code execution, depending on the surrounding code and memory layout.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malformed MD2 Files:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing specially crafted or malformed MD2 files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **File Creation/Modification:** An attacker needs to be able to create or modify MD2 files to include a malicious `pcSkins->name` string.
*   **File Access:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious file to the Assimp library for processing (e.g., through a vulnerable application that uses Assimp).

**Mitigation or fix:**

The provided content does not explicitly state a fix, but the root cause analysis suggests that proper bounds checking on `iLen` before the `memcpy` operation is necessary.  String truncation or using a safer string copying function (e.g., `strncpy`) could also mitigate the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Version:** Assimp v5.4.3
*   **PoC Available:** A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit is provided, demonstrating how to trigger the vulnerability using a fuzzer.
*   **Milestone:** The issue is associated with the "assimp 6.0 release" milestone, indicating it's been addressed or is planned to be addressed in that version.
*   **Fuzzer Discovery:** The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing.
