  "query": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. Affected is the function AssimpMD2ImporterInternReadFile in the library code/AssetLib/MD2/MD2Loader.cpp of the component Malformed File Handler. The manipulation of the argument Name leads to stack-based buffer overflow. The attack needs to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.",
