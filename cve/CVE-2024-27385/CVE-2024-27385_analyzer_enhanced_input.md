## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was discovered in the slsi_handle_nan_rx_event_log_ind function in Samsung Mobile Processor Exynos 1380 and Exynos 1480 related to **no input validation check** on tag_len for rx coming from userspace, which can lead to heap overwrite.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **no input validation check**
- **impact:** heap overwrite
- **product:** Samsung Mobile Processor
- **component:** slsi_handle_nan_rx_event_log_ind function in Exynos 1380 and Exynos 1480

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability lies in the `slsi_handle_nan_rx_event_log_ind()` function within the Samsung Mobile Processor. This function does not perform any input validation on the `tag_len` parameter for received data coming from userspace.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the absence of a check on the `tag_len` parameter. This allows an attacker to potentially supply an arbitrary value for `tag_len`.
*   **Heap Overflow:** Since there's no validation of `tag_len`, a malicious userspace actor can provide a value for `tag_len` that is larger than the allocated buffer, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Heap Overwrite:** Exploitation of this vulnerability will result in a heap overwrite. This can lead to various negative consequences, including:
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The system may crash due to memory corruption.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In more advanced scenarios, an attacker might be able to overwrite function pointers or other critical data structures in memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Userspace Input:** The attack vector is through malicious input provided from userspace.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to send data from userspace to the vulnerable function. This typically means the attacker would need to have some level of control or access to the userspace environment on the device that has the vulnerable processor.
* The attacker needs the capability to craft a specific message to trigger the vulnerability.

**Affected Products:**
*   Exynos 1380
*   Exynos 1480

**Severity:**
* Medium
