## Vulnerability Description
The goTenna Pro App **does not use SecureRandom when generating passwords** for sharing cryptographic keys. The random function in use makes it easier for attackers to brute force this password if the broadcasted encryption key is captured over RF. This only applies to the optional broadcast of an encryption key, so it is advised to share the key with local QR code for higher security operations.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **does not use SecureRandom when generating passwords**
- **vector:** brute force
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** goTenna Pro App

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47126:

**CVE-2024-47126: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)**

*   **Root Cause:** The goTenna Pro App uses a cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) instead of `SecureRandom` when generating passwords for sharing cryptographic keys. This makes the generated password more vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
*   **Vulnerability:** The use of a weak PRNG for generating encryption key sharing passwords.
*   **Impact:** If an attacker captures the broadcasted encryption key over RF, the weak password can be brute-forced, allowing the attacker to decrypt the key and gain access to all past and future messages encrypted with that specific key.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   An attacker needs to be within RF range to capture the broadcasted encryption key.
    *   The attacker then performs a brute-force attack on the weak password used to protect the key.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs the capability to:
    *   Capture RF signals.
    *   Perform a brute-force attack to crack the weak password.
*   **Additional Details:** The vulnerability is specific to the optional broadcast feature of encryption keys over RF. Sharing keys via local QR codes is recommended as a more secure alternative.
