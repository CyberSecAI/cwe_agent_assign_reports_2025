# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-47126

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-47126

## Description

The goTenna Pro App **does not use SecureRandom when generating passwords** for sharing cryptographic keys. The random function in use makes it easier for attackers to brute force this password if the broadcasted encryption key is captured over RF. This only applies to the optional broadcast of an encryption key, so it is advised to share the key with local QR code for higher security operations.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Weakness:** does not use SecureRandom when generating passwords
- **Vector:** brute force
- **Attacker:** attackers
- **Product:** goTenna Pro App

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-338 | Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The application **does not use SecureRandom when generating passwords** for sharing cryptographic keys. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-338, which falls under the broader class CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values). While CWE-330 is a parent, CWE-338 is more specific as it explicitly calls out the use of a cryptographically weak PRNG, which aligns directly with the vulnerability description.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a cryptographically weak PRNG (CWE-338)**, which leads to the generation of weak passwords. These weak passwords make the encryption key vulnerable to brute-force attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized access to messages.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is that the application **does not use SecureRandom when generating passwords**. The evidence clearly points to CWE-338, as it directly addresses the use of a cryptographically weak PRNG. The vulnerability description explicitly states this. The retriever results also list CWE-338 as a highly relevant candidate. The relationships confirm that CWE-338 is a specific type of CWE-330, but is a better fit.
