While it is a Compound weakness, it is the most direct representation of the described vulnerability. The secondary weakness, Stored XSS (CWE-79), is a likely impact of the CSRF vulnerability, as a successful CSRF attack could modify data to inject malicious scripts.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe352 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** (**weakness**) vulnerability (CWE-352). An attacker exploits this to force a privileged user to perform unwanted actions. These actions can then lead to Stored XSS (CWE-79) by modifying data, such as injecting malicious scripts, that are then rendered in a web page.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is clearly the **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability, as stated in the vulnerability description. The **impact** of this vulnerability is Stored XSS, indicating that a successful CSRF attack can lead to the injection of malicious scripts.\n\nThe provided evidence states: \"**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability in Ivn R. Delgado Martnez WP Custom Google Search allows Stored XSS.\" This directly links CWE-352 to the reported issue.\n\nThe Retriever Results also list CWE-352 as the top candidate. The close relationship between CSRF and XSS makes CWE-79 a relevant secondary consideration.\n\nI am confident in this assessment because the vulnerability description explicitly states that it is a **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability. The evidence also mentions that it leads to Stored XSS, which supports the inclusion of CWE-79 as a secondary weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.

interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant

neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage:
