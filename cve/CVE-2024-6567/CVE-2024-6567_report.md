# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-6567

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-6567

## Description

The Ebook Store plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 5.8001. This is due to the plugin utilizing fpdi-protection and not preventing direct access to test files that have display_errors set to true. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** utilization of fpdi-protection
- **Impact:** Full Path Disclosure
- **Attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **Product:** Ebook Store plugin for WordPress
- **Version:** all versions up to and including 5.8001

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information When Using Obsolete Function | 0.75 | Variant | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-425 | Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') | 0.5 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-200, which is a child of CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere) and CWE-215 (Insertion of Hard-Coded Credentials). The vulnerability involves exposing the full path of the web application, which is a form of sensitive information.
CWE-425 is included as a secondary issue because the vulnerability allows direct access to test files. This can be seen as a form of forced browsing.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **utilization of fpdi-protection** in the Ebook Store plugin, which leads to the failure to prevent direct access to test files. This, in turn, results in the exposure of the full path of the web application due to `display_errors` being set to true.
- **Root Cause:** **utilization of fpdi-protection** and failure to prevent direct access to test files.
- **Weakness:** Exposure of the full path of the web application.
- **Impact:** The full path can be used to aid other attacks.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive information (full path) due to the plugin's configuration and file access controls. The **rootcause** is the **utilization of fpdi-protection** and not preventing direct access to test files with `display_errors` enabled.
CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information When Using Obsolete Function) is chosen as the primary CWE because it best describes the exposure of the full path. CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) is a secondary issue because the vulnerability allows direct access to the test files.
The relationships in the graph help to understand how these CWEs relate to each other and provide a more complete picture of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70

**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense
