While the description points to an authentication issue, the specifics are lacking. The classification guidance recommends to avoid general access control issues if a more specific CWE can be selected. In this case, the description indicates \"Improper Authentication,\" which aligns with CWE-287. CWE-863 was considered, as the impact involves \"Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels,\" suggesting an authorization issue. However, without more detail on the actual defect and authorization checks, it is a secondary candidate. The abstraction levels guided the choice of Class-level CWEs, given the limited details.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe287 -- CAN_ALSO_BE --> cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Authentication** (CWE-287), leading to the exploitation of incorrectly configured access control security levels. The root cause is the flawed authentication process. The impact is unauthorized access due to the bypass.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-287 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of \"**Improper Authentication vulnerability**\". The phrase \"Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels\" suggests authorization issues, which led to consideration of CWE-863.\n\nThe decision is based primarily on the provided vulnerability description, which states \"**Improper Authentication vulnerability** in Drupal Login Disable allows Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels.\" The classification guidance highlights the importance of distinguishing between authentication and authorization issues. In this case, the description explicitly mentions \"Improper Authentication,\" suggesting that the primary issue lies in the authentication process, although there could be some authorization issues.\n\nThe retriever results and relationship analysis further supported this decision, with CWE-287 and CWE-863 being top candidates. The lack of specific details about the **rootcause** limits the ability to select a more specific Base or Variant CWE. Therefore, selecting the Class-level CWE-287 and CWE-863 is at the appropriate level of specificity, given the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**:

Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or
