  "description": "XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 1.8 and prior to 15.10.16, 16.4.6, and 16.10.1, it is possible for a remote unauthenticated user to escape from the HQL execution context and perform a blind SQL injection to execute arbitrary SQL statements on the database backend, including when Prevent unregistered users from viewing pages, regardless of the page rights and Prevent unregistered users from editing pages, regardless of the page rights options are enabled. Depending on the used database backend, the attacker may be able to not only obtain confidential information such as password hashes from the database, but also execute UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE queries. This issue has been patched in versions 16.10.1, 16.4.6 and 15.10.16. There is no known workaround, other than upgrading XWiki.",

The vulnerability stems from **insufficient sanitization** of user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of the vulnerability description to CWE-89, which is a Base level CWE. There are Variant children of CWE-89 such as CWE-564 (SQL Injection: Hibernate), but the description doesn't specify the use of Hibernate, so the more general CWE-89 is more appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe564[\"CWE-564: SQL Injection: Hibernate\"]\n    \n    cwe564 -->|CHILDOF| cwe89\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe564 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events for this vulnerability is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper neutralization** of special elements in SQL commands (CWE-89).\n2.  **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary SQL statements, potential information disclosure (password hashes), and data manipulation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly points to CWE-89 as the primary weakness. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section highlights \"**SQL injection, blind SQL injection**\" as a key **weakness**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this by stating that the vulnerability stems from **insufficient sanitization** of user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to escape the HQL execution context and inject arbitrary SQL commands.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-89 as the top match.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in SQL commands, without being overly specific about the technology or context in which the vulnerability occurs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Not Used:** While encoding/escaping could be related, the core issue is the **improper neutralization** of SQL special characters, which is better captured by CWE-89.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**:
