Affected by this vulnerability is the function __sanitizerinternal_strlen of the file binutils/nm.c of the component nm. The manipulation of the argument const leads to buffer overflow. The attack can be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",
