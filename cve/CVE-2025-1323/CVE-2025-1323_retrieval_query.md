# Retrieval Query for CVE-2025-1323

# Vulnerability Description

    The WP-Recall Registration, Profile, Commerce & More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the databeat parameter in all versions up to, and including, 16.26.10 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis
    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs.
