# Analysis Report for CVE-2025-1323

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-1323

## Description

The WP-Recall Registration, Profile, Commerce & More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the databeat parameter in all versions up to, and including, 16.26.10 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** ['insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query', 'insufficient escaping on user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on existing SQL query']

- **Impact:** ['extract sensitive information from the database', 'extract sensitive information from database']
- **Vector:** databeat parameter
- **Attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **Product:** ['Commerce & More plugin for WordPress', 'WP-Recall Registration', 'Profile']
- **Version:** up to and including 16.26.10

| CWE-89   | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 1.0        | Base                  | Primary                       | Allowed                       |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-89, which falls under the class CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')). The vulnerability description clearly indicates **insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient preparation** of the SQL query, leading directly to SQL injection. The relationship here is hierarchical, with CWE-89 being a specific type of injection.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events is as follows:
1.  **Root Cause:** **Insufficient escaping** on the user-supplied parameter and **lack of sufficient preparation** on the existing SQL query (CWE-89).
2.  **Weakness:** SQL injection vulnerability due to the above root cause.
3.  **Impact:** Unauthenticated attackers can **extract sensitive information from the database**.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is heavily based on the provided evidence, which clearly points to SQL injection. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient preparation** on the SQL query, leading to the ability to inject SQL commands.

The key evidence is: "The WP-Recall Registration, Profile, Commerce & More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the databeat parameter in all versions up to, and including, 16.26.10 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database."

CWE-89 is the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an SQL command.
