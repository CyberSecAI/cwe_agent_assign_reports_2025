CWE-863, **Incorrect Authorization**, is a more specific child of CWE-285, as it describes cases where an authorization check exists but is performed incorrectly. CWE-639, **Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key**, and CWE-425, **Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')**, are base-level CWEs that can potentially lead to authorization bypasses. The selection prioritizes the **Improper Authorization** at the class level because the description indicates a general **improper authorization** issue without specifying the exact mechanism.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe639 -->|RELATED| cwe285\n    cwe425 -->|RELATED| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe639,cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper authorization**, leading to a security feature bypass and minor information disclosure.\n\nImproper Authorization (CWE-285) -> Security Feature Bypass -> Information Disclosure\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is described as an **Improper Authorization** issue in Adobe Commerce.
