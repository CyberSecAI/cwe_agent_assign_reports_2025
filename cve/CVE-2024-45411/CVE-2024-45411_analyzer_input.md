# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-45411

## Vulnerability Description
Twig is a template language for PHP. Under some circumstances, the sandbox security checks are not run which allows user-contributed templates to bypass the sandbox restrictions. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.44.8, 2.16.1, and 3.14.0.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** bypass sandbox restrictions
- **vector:** user-contributed templates
- **product:** Twig

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45411:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a flaw in how Twig handles sandboxed template inclusions when the sandbox is enabled via the `include()` function. If a template is loaded *before* the `include()` call, but in a non-sandboxed context, the sandbox security checks are not properly enforced.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Sandbox Bypass:** The core issue is a bypass of the intended sandbox security restrictions. Templates loaded outside the sandbox context are not checked when included later within a sandboxed `include()` call.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unrestricted Template Execution:** By bypassing the sandbox, an attacker can execute arbitrary code or access resources not intended to be accessible within the sandboxed environment. This allows for potentially severe consequences such as data breaches, privilege escalation, or denial of service attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Template:** An attacker could inject or manipulate a template that is then included via the vulnerable `include()` function within a sandboxed environment.
- **Template Pre-loading:** The attacker needs the ability to control or influence the template loading process in a way that a template is loaded in a non-sandboxed context before being included in a sandboxed manner.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Template Injection:** The attacker must have the ability to influence the content of templates used by the Twig engine, or have the ability to add template that will later be loaded and included.
- **Understanding of Sandbox Usage:**  The attacker needs to know when the sandbox is disabled globally and enabled by a function call in the template code.
- **Pre-loading Control:** The attacker must be able to cause the vulnerable template to load in a non-sandboxed context before it is included with the sandbox enabled.

**Additional Technical Details:**

The vulnerability occurs when the sandbox is disabled globally, but enabled specifically for an `include()` function call.  If a template is loaded via `load()` before the `include()` call in a non-sandboxed context, the `checkSecurity()` method is not called during the render step of the include.

The fix involves ensuring that the sandbox security checks (`checkSecurity()`) are *always* run at runtime, even if the template was loaded previously in a non-sandboxed manner, which was not happening in the vulnerable code.
The fix was implemented by adding `$loaded->unwrap()->checkSecurity();` before rendering in the include function.

The provided test cases demonstrate the vulnerability, where a template loaded using `load()` without the sandbox is later included in a template that enables the sandbox via `include(..., sandboxed=true)`.
