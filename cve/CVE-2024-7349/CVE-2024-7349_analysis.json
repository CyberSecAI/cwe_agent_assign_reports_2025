The vulnerability is due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query** which leads to SQL injection. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the hierarchical relationship between CWE-89 and its parent classes related to injection vulnerabilities. While there are other potential CWEs related to input validation, the specific nature of the vulnerability points directly to SQL injection. The base level of CWE-89 is the most appropriate given the detailed nature of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe943[\"CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe943\n    cwe943 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe943,cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query** (CWE-89). This allows an attacker to inject SQL commands, leading to the ability to extract sensitive information from the database and cause information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description, which clearly states that the root cause is **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query** leading to a blind SQL Injection. The evidence supporting this is: \"The LifterLMS - WP LMS for eLearning, Online Courses, & Quizzes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to blind SQL Injection via the order parameter in all versions up to, and including, 7.7.5 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**.\"\n\nThe retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the primary CWE. The hierarchical relationships confirm that CWE-89 is the most specific and appropriate choice.
