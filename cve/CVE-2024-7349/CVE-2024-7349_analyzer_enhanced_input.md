## Vulnerability Description
The LifterLMS - WP LMS for eLearning, Online Courses, & Quizzes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to blind SQL Injection via the order parameter in all versions up to, and including, 7.7.5 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
