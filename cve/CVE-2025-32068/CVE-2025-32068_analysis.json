  "reference_content": "```text\nThe content describes a security vulnerability in the MediaWiki OAuth2 extension where revoking authorization of an OAuth2 consumer does not invalidate refresh tokens, allowing continued access.\n\n-   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The refresh tokens were not invalidated upon revoking the OAuth2 consumer's authorization. The access tokens are removed, but the refresh tokens remained valid.\n-   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:\n    -   An OAuth2 consumer can obtain new access tokens even after its authorization has been revoked.\n    -   The error messages do not clearly differentiate between an invalid token and a revoked authorization, making it difficult to diagnose the issue.\n    -   Deauthorizing an identify-only consumer has no effect, and the consumer can continue accessing user profile information.\n-   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can use a revoked OAuth2 consumer to obtain new access tokens and maintain unauthorized access to the user's account, including the ability to edit the wiki (if the consumer has the appropriate grants) or access profile information.\n-   **Attack vectors**:\n    -   An attacker creates an OAuth2 consumer with appropriate grants.\n    -   The attacker authorizes the consumer and obtains access and refresh tokens.\n    -   Even if the authorization is revoked through Special:OAuthManageMyGrants, the attacker can still use the refresh token to obtain new access tokens and maintain unauthorized access.\n-   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create an OAuth2 consumer, obtain access and refresh tokens, and then exploit the fact that the refresh token remains valid even after revocation.\n-   **Mitigation or fix**: A patch was created to check for revocation when using refresh tokens (Check revocation when using refresh tokens). This patch has been deployed and merged.\n```",

While it would be ideal to find a more specific Base or Variant CWE, the provided information does not offer enough detail to pinpoint the exact nature of the **incorrect authorization**. CWE-306 is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), but the description focuses on **incorrect authorization**, making it less directly relevant. The relationship between authentication and authorization is relevant, as authentication typically precedes authorization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect authorization** check (CWE-863). Because the authorization check is flawed, it leads to the **impact** of Authentication Bypass. If the vulnerability was a complete **lack of authentication**, then the vulnerability would have started with CWE-306.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **incorrect authorization vulnerability**. The provided evidence, particularly the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\", supports this assessment. The key phrase \"**Incorrect Authorization vulnerability**\" directly points to an authorization issue rather than an authentication one. The fact that revoking authorization doesn't invalidate refresh tokens suggests a flaw in how authorization is handled *after* a user is authenticated.\n\nThe selection of CWE-863 is based on the evidence indicating a flaw in the authorization logic itself, rather than a complete absence of authorization. The provided information does not go into sufficient detail to allow selection of a more specific, Base-level CWE.\n\nCWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was considered because the impact is authentication bypass. However, the root cause is a flaw in the authorization process, making it a secondary candidate.\n\nThe confidence score of 0.7 reflects the evidence strength being \"MEDIUM.\" While the description clearly states \"**Incorrect Authorization vulnerability**\", the details of the authorization process are not provided, limiting the ability to choose a more specific CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1642.33\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 1545.73\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
