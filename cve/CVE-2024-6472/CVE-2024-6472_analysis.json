  "description": "**Certificate Validation user interface in LibreOffice allows potential vulnerability**. Signed macros are scripts that have been digitally signed by the developer using a cryptographic signature. When a document with a signed macro is opened a warning is displayed by LibreOffice before the macro is executed. Previously if verification failed the user could fail to understand the failure and choose to enable the macros anyway. This issue affects LibreOffice from 24.2 before 24.2.5.",

  },
  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the fact that LibreOffice allowed users to bypass failed digital signature verifications of macros and enable them anyway. This was particularly problematic in High Macro Security mode, where such bypass should not have been possible.\n\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness was the ability of users to ignore macro signature verification failures, thus allowing the execution of potentially malicious or compromised macros. This essentially invalidated the intended security of signed macros.\n\n- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploiting this vulnerability would allow an attacker to bypass the signature verification process and trick a user into running malicious macros by ignoring warnings. This could lead to a variety of malicious outcomes, such as:\n  - Code execution with the user's privileges\n  - Data exfiltration or manipulation\n  - System compromise.\n\n- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves crafting a document with a signed macro. An attacker could present it to a target and rely on the user ignoring the security warning for the macro.\n  \n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to create or modify documents with macros and some form of access to the target to deliver them.",

Specifically, while CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) and CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature) are related to the underlying cause, the user interface aspect described in CWE-356 (Product UI does not Warn User of Unsafe Actions) is a more direct representation of the vulnerability. The vulnerability stems from the user being able to bypass warnings related to certificate validation failures, making CWE-356 the most relevant.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe356[\"CWE-356: Product UI does not Warn User of Unsafe Actions\"]\n    cwe295[\"CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\"]\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    \n    cwe356 -->|PEEROF| cwe295\n    cwe356 -->|PEEROF| cwe347\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe356 primary\n    class cwe295,cwe347 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **certificate validation** potentially failing (CWE-295 or CWE-347 may apply, if the certificate validation logic itself is flawed). However, the core issue is that the user interface **does not adequately warn the user** about the implications of ignoring this failure, leading to potentially malicious macros being executed. The chain is:\n1.  Potential: Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295) / Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature (CWE-347)\n2.  Root Cause: Product UI does not Warn User of Unsafe Actions (CWE-356)\n3.  Impact: Execution of malicious macros, leading to code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered CWE-295 and CWE-347 due to the mention of certificate validation and signature verification. However, the key aspect of the vulnerability is that the user interface allows users to ignore the warnings related to the failed verification. This makes CWE-356 the primary CWE. The evidence \"Previously if verification failed the user could fail to understand the failure and choose to enable the macros anyway\" clearly supports this. While the retriever results also suggest these CWEs, the best fit is based on the **root cause** being the UI issue. The selected CWE is at the Base level of abstraction, which aligns with MITRE's preferred level. The chain is important here.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-356: Product UI does not Warn User of Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product's user interface does not warn the user before undertaking an unsafe action on behalf of that user.
