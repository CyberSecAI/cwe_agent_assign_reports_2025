## Vulnerability Description
**Certificate Validation user interface in LibreOffice allows potential vulnerability**. Signed macros are scripts that have been digitally signed by the developer using a cryptographic signature. When a document with a signed macro is opened a warning is displayed by LibreOffice before the macro is executed. Previously if verification failed the user could fail to understand the failure and choose to enable the macros anyway. This issue affects LibreOffice from 24.2 before 24.2.5.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Certificate Validation user interface in LibreOffice allows potential vulnerability**
- **product:** LibreOffice
- **version:** from 24.2 before 24.2.5

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the fact that LibreOffice allowed users to bypass failed digital signature verifications of macros and enable them anyway. This was particularly problematic in High Macro Security mode, where such bypass should not have been possible.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness was the ability of users to ignore macro signature verification failures, thus allowing the execution of potentially malicious or compromised macros. This essentially invalidated the intended security of signed macros.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploiting this vulnerability would allow an attacker to bypass the signature verification process and trick a user into running malicious macros by ignoring warnings. This could lead to a variety of malicious outcomes, such as:
  - Code execution with the user's privileges
  - Data exfiltration or manipulation
  - System compromise.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves crafting a document with a signed macro. An attacker could present it to a target and rely on the user ignoring the security warning for the macro.
  
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to create or modify documents with macros and some form of access to the target to deliver them.
