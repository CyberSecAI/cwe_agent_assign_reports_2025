## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11213 (Based on content mentioning "Authenticated Time-Based SQL Injection in Employee management system")

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the improper handling of the `id` parameter in the `edit_role.php` script. This parameter is directly inserted into an SQL query without any sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Time-Based SQL Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter in a POST request. Specifically, the attacker can use the `SLEEP()` function to introduce time delays and confirm successful SQL injection based on the response time.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Time-based SQL injection can cause significant delays and potentially lead to a denial of service by using functions like `SLEEP()`.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If exploited further, it could lead to unauthorized access or modification of critical data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in a POST request to the `edit_role.php` script.
- The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable `edit_role.php` script.
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- Basic understanding of SQL syntax and SQL injection techniques.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating how to trigger the vulnerability using a `SLEEP()` function within the injected SQL.
- The content also mentions that tools like `sqlmap`/`ghauri` can be used for automated exploitation.
- Mitigation steps include using prepared statements, parameterized queries, ORM libraries, input validation and SQL query timeouts.
