  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2025-32784', description='conda-forge-webservices is the web app deployed to run conda-forge admin commands and linting. In versions prior to 2025.4.10, a **race condition** vulnerability has been identified in the conda-forge-webservices component used within the shared build infrastructure. This vulnerability, categorized as a **Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) issue**, can be exploited to introduce unauthorized modifications to build artifacts stored in the cf-staging Anaconda channel. Exploitation may result in the unauthorized publication of malicious artifacts to the production conda-forge channel. The core vulnerability results from the absence of atomicity between the hash validation and the artifact copy operation. This gap allows an attacker, with access to the cf-staging token, to overwrite the validated artifact with a malicious version immediately after hash verification, but before the copy action is executed. As the cf-staging channel permits artifact overwrites, such an operation can be carried out using the anaconda upload --force command. This vulnerability is fixed in 2025.4.10.', key_phrases={'rootcause': ['Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) issue', 'race condition'], 'weakness': '', 'impact': ['unauthorized publication of malicious artifacts', 'unauthorized modifications to build artifacts'], 'vector': '', 'attacker': 'attacker with access to cf-staging token', 'product': 'conda-forge-webservices', 'version': 'prior to 2025.4.10', 'component': 'conda-forge-webservices component used within the shared build infrastructure'}, reference_content=\"## Analysis of CVE-2025-32784 based on provided content\\n\\nThe provided content is directly related to CVE-2025-32784. It details a race condition vulnerability in the `conda-forge-webservices` component. Here's a breakdown of the information:\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\n\\nThe vulnerability stems from a lack of atomicity between the hash validation and the artifact copy operation. An attacker can overwrite a validated artifact with a malicious version *after* the hash is verified but *before* the copy to the production channel is initiated. The cf-staging channel allows overwrites using `anaconda upload --force`.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n\\n*   **Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU)**: This is the primary vulnerability. The system checks the hash of an artifact, and then, before using that validated hash to copy the artifact, the artifact can be changed.\\n*   **Lack of Atomic Operation**: The hash validation and copy operation are not performed as a single, atomic transaction.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n\\n*   **Unauthorized publication of malicious artifacts**: Successful exploitation can lead to the publication of malicious packages to the production `conda-forge` channel.\\n*   **Supply chain compromise**:  A targeted attack on a widely used package could lead to privilege escalation or widespread artifact poisoning.\\n*   **User compromise**: Users installing the malicious artifacts could be compromised.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n\\n*   The attacker needs access to the `cf-staging` token.\\n*   The attacker monitors for legitimate build events triggering the copy process.\\n*   The attacker overwrites the artifact in `cf-staging` immediately after hash verification but before the copy.\\n*   The attacker uses the `anaconda upload --force` command to overwrite the artifact.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n\\n*   Possession of a valid `cf-staging` token.\\n*   Ability to monitor build events.\\n*   Ability to upload artifacts to the `cf-staging` channel.\\n\\n**Mitigation or fix:**\\n\\n*   **Re-checking the hash after the copy**: Verify the hash again after the copy operation and delete any mismatches.\\n*   **Temporary staging area**: Move the package to a temporary staging area where it cannot be replaced before initiating the upload.\\n*   **Secured build queue**: Moving builds of packages from feedstocks to a secured build queue to eliminate the multistage upload process.\\n*   The commit referenced (141ed27) implements a notification to the core team if a bad copy operation is detected.\\n\\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\\n\\n*   Specific code snippets are provided, including the entry point function (`OutputsCopyHandler.post`), the hash validation function (`_is_valid_output_hash`), and the copy initiation function (`copy_feedstock_outputs`).\\n*   Details about the affected resource (`conda-forge-webservices` service on Heroku) and its role in the build process.\\n*   The commit message indicates that the fix includes notifying the core team if a bad copy operation is detected.\\n*   The commit also includes code to comment on existing issues or create new issues in the `conda-forge/core-notes` repository if a bad copy is detected.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '367', 'name': 'Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': \"The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    conda-forge-webservices is the web app deployed to run conda-forge admin commands and linting. In versions prior to 2025.4.10, a **race condition** vulnerability has been identified in the conda-forge-webservices component used within the shared build infrastructure. This vulnerability, categorized as a **Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) issue**, can be exploited to introduce unauthorized modifications to build artifacts stored in the cf-staging Anaconda channel. Exploitation may result in the unauthorized publication of malicious artifacts to the production conda-forge channel. The core vulnerability results from the absence of atomicity between the hash validation and the artifact copy operation. This gap allows an attacker, with access to the cf-staging token, to overwrite the validated artifact with a malicious version immediately after hash verification, but before the copy action is executed. As the cf-staging channel permits artifact overwrites, such an operation can be carried out using the anaconda upload --force command. This vulnerability is fixed in 2025.4.10.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) issue'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
