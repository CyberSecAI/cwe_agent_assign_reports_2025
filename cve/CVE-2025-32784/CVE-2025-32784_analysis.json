  "description": "conda-forge-webservices is the web app deployed to run conda-forge admin commands and linting. In versions prior to 2025.4.10, a **race condition** vulnerability has been identified in the conda-forge-webservices component used within the shared build infrastructure. This vulnerability, categorized as a **Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) issue**, can be exploited to introduce unauthorized modifications to build artifacts stored in the cf-staging Anaconda channel. Exploitation may result in the unauthorized publication of malicious artifacts to the production conda-forge channel. The core vulnerability results from the absence of atomicity between the hash validation and the artifact copy operation. This gap allows an attacker, with access to the cf-staging token, to overwrite the validated artifact with a malicious version immediately after hash verification, but before the copy action is executed. As the cf-staging channel permits artifact overwrites, such an operation can be carried out using the anaconda upload --force command. This vulnerability is fixed in 2025.4.10.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-32784 based on provided content\n\nThe provided content is directly related to CVE-2025-32784. It details a race condition vulnerability in the `conda-forge-webservices` component. Here's a breakdown of the information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from a lack of atomicity between the hash validation and the artifact copy operation. An attacker can overwrite a validated artifact with a malicious version *after* the hash is verified but *before* the copy to the production channel is initiated. The cf-staging channel allows overwrites using `anaconda upload --force`.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU)**: This is the primary vulnerability. The system checks the hash of an artifact, and then, before using that validated hash to copy the artifact, the artifact can be changed.\n*   **Lack of Atomic Operation**: The hash validation and copy operation are not performed as a single, atomic transaction.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthorized publication of malicious artifacts**: Successful exploitation can lead to the publication of malicious packages to the production `conda-forge` channel.\n*   **Supply chain compromise**:  A targeted attack on a widely used package could lead to privilege escalation or widespread artifact poisoning.\n*   **User compromise**: Users installing the malicious artifacts could be compromised.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The attacker needs access to the `cf-staging` token.\n*   The attacker monitors for legitimate build events triggering the copy process.\n*   The attacker overwrites the artifact in `cf-staging` immediately after hash verification but before the copy.\n*   The attacker uses the `anaconda upload --force` command to overwrite the artifact.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Possession of a valid `cf-staging` token.\n*   Ability to monitor build events.\n*   Ability to upload artifacts to the `cf-staging` channel.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Re-checking the hash after the copy**: Verify the hash again after the copy operation and delete any mismatches.\n*   **Temporary staging area**: Move the package to a temporary staging area where it cannot be replaced before initiating the upload.\n*   **Secured build queue**: Moving builds of packages from feedstocks to a secured build queue to eliminate the multistage upload process.\n*   The commit referenced (141ed27) implements a notification to the core team if a bad copy operation is detected.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   Specific code snippets are provided, including the entry point function (`OutputsCopyHandler.post`), the hash validation function (`_is_valid_output_hash`), and the copy initiation function (`copy_feedstock_outputs`).\n*   Details about the affected resource (`conda-forge-webservices` service on Heroku) and its role in the build process.\n*   The commit message indicates that the fix includes notifying the core team if a bad copy operation is detected.\n*   The commit also includes code to comment on existing issues or create new issues in the `conda-forge/core-notes` repository if a bad copy is detected.",

CWE-362, a class-level CWE, is a broader category of race conditions, and CWE-367 is a specific type. CWE-287 is included as a secondary consideration because the attacker needs to authenticate to the `cf-staging` token to perform the overwrite.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe367 primary\n    class cwe362,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** (CWE-367) where the state of the artifact can change between the time it's checked and the time it's used. The attacker authenticates (or has already authenticated) to the cf-staging channel (potentially CWE-287 if authentication is **improper**). Then, the attacker overwrites the validated artifact with a malicious version. This leads to the **unauthorized publication of malicious artifacts**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **TOCTOU race condition** (CWE-367). The vulnerability description explicitly mentions this issue: \"This vulnerability, categorized as a **Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) issue**...\". The description further explains, \"The core vulnerability results from the absence of atomicity between the hash validation and the artifact copy operation.\" This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-367: \"The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.\"\n\nCWE-362 is a broader Class-level CWE, and while applicable, CWE-367 is a more specific Base-level CWE and thus a better fit. CWE-287 is considered because the attacker needs to authenticate, but the description doesn't explicitly state that the authentication mechanism is **improper**, so it's a secondary consideration.\n\nI am confident in this assessment because the vulnerability description directly points to a **TOCTOU race condition**, and CWE-367 accurately captures this weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
