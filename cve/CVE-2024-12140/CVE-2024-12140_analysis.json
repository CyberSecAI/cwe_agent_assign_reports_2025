However, based on the provided information, there isn't sufficient detail to pinpoint a more specific child CWE. CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is considered as a potential secondary weakness due to the **information exposure** aspect, but is a high-level class and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe668 -- CHILDOF --> cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient restrictions on which templates can be included** leading to **information exposure**, allowing attackers to extract data from private or draft templates they shouldn't access.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Insufficient restrictions on which templates can be included** (Incorrect Authorization)\n  - **Weakness:** **Information Exposure** (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere)\n  - **Impact:** Extract data from private or draft templates\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as the primary candidate due to the **insufficient restrictions** on template inclusion, which is a form of authorization failure. This aligns with the vulnerability description mentioning that authenticated attackers can access data they should not have access to. CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) was considered because the vulnerability leads to **information exposure**.\n\nThe relationship graph indicates that CWE-863 can be a parent of more specific authorization-related CWEs. However, without more detailed information about the exact mechanism of the authorization failure, it's difficult to choose a more specific CWE.\n\nThe final decision to map CWE-863 is based on the evidence of **insufficient restrictions**, which directly relates to an authorization issue. While **information exposure** is a symptom, the root cause lies in the authorization **failure**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
