  "description": "PDF-XChange Editor JB2 File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JB2 files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24495.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8843:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of JB2 files within PDF-XChange Editor. This improper validation allows for out-of-bounds reads.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- Out-of-Bounds Read: The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, where the software attempts to access memory beyond the allocated buffer when processing a crafted JB2 file.\n- Improper Input Validation: The software fails to adequately validate user-supplied data in JB2 files, allowing the crafted data to trigger the out-of-bounds read.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Information Disclosure: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to disclose sensitive information by reading data from memory locations outside the intended buffer.\n- Potential for Further Exploitation: The advisory mentions that this vulnerability, when combined with other vulnerabilities, could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Malicious JB2 Files: The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted JB2 file using PDF-XChange Editor.\n- Malicious Web Pages: A user may be tricked to visit a malicious page that could trigger the vulnerability.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- User Interaction: The attack requires user interaction as the target must open a malicious file or visit a malicious webpage.\n- No Special Privileges: The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability. It can be triggered by anyone capable of opening the file or visiting the website.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The vulnerability has been addressed in PDF-XChange Editor version 10.4.0.388.",

This **Out-of-bounds Read** results in **Information Disclosure**. An attacker exploits the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** to trigger the **Out-of-bounds Read** condition during JB2 file parsing.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary classification is **CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)**, as the vulnerability description explicitly states that the issue results in a read past the end of an allocated object. This is a direct match for the definition of **CWE-125**. The **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** is a contributing factor and is classified as **CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation)**. **CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read)** was considered as a more specific case of **CWE-125** and is a reasonable secondary candidate, because the vulnerability occurs in the context of reading a buffer.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object.\"\n\nThe graph relationships support this by showing that **CWE-20** can lead to **CWE-125**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because **CWE-125** directly describes the **Out-of-bounds Read** condition, and **CWE-20** describes the **lack of proper validation** that leads to it.\n```",
