  "description": "PDF-XChange Editor EMF File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of EMF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24313.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8828:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of EMF (Enhanced Metafile) files within PDF-XChange Editor. Specifically, the software doesn't correctly validate input, which leads to an out-of-bounds read.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- Out-of-bounds read: The primary weakness is the ability to read beyond the allocated memory region. This occurs due to insufficient validation of data within EMF files.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Information Disclosure: The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially access sensitive information from the application's memory.\n- Potential for Further Exploitation: The advisory mentions that this vulnerability can be combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Malicious File: The primary attack vector is through crafted EMF files embedded or used by PDF-XChange Editor.\n- Malicious Page: User can be lured to a malicious webpage designed to trigger the vulnerability through an EMF file.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- User Interaction: The attacker requires user interaction. This means the user must open a malicious file or visit a malicious page that triggers the vulnerability.\n- No Special Privileges Needed: The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring special privileges within the system. The attacker does not need to be local to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability was fixed in version 10.3.1.387 of PDF-XChange Editor.\n- The vulnerability is categorized as an information disclosure vulnerability.\n- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 3.3 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N), indicating that is an attack from local (L), low complexity (L), no privileges (N), user interaction required (R), no scope change (U), with a low impact on confidentiality (L).",

CWE-20 is a broader category that describes the root cause of the issue. CWE-125 is a child of CWE-119, which describes general buffer boundary errors. The vulnerability description clearly indicates an out-of-bounds read, making CWE-125 the most appropriate primary CWE. The **lack of proper validation** leads to this out-of-bounds read.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe125\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20). This leads to an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) during EMF file parsing, resulting in **information disclosure**. The vulnerability description also mentions the potential for arbitrary code execution if this vulnerability is combined with others.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-125 because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions an \"Out-Of-Bounds Read\". The root cause is the **lack of proper validation**, which corresponds to CWE-20. The relationship graph shows how these CWEs are related, with CWE-20 potentially leading to CWE-125. The description explicitly mentions the \"lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object.\"\n\nCWE-119 was considered but is too general.
