  "description": "A vulnerability was found in libzvbi up to 0.2.43. It has been declared as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is the function vbi_strndup_iconv_ucs2 of the file src/conv.c. The manipulation of the argument src_length leads to **integer overflow**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 0.2.44 is able to address this issue. The patch is named ca1672134b3e2962cd392212c73f44f8f4cb489f. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The code maintainer was informed beforehand about the issues. She reacted very fast and highly professional.",

The provided commit message indicates the vulnerability lies within multiple functions, including `strndup_identity`, `strndup_utf8_ucs2`, `vbi_capture_sim_load_caption`, and `vbi_search_new`. Specifically, integer overflows can occur during buffer size calculations, leading to heap overflows.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\nInteger overflows leading to heap overflows.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\nThe impact of these vulnerabilities can vary, potentially leading to crashes and denial of service (DoS).\n\nMitigation or fix:\nThe vulnerabilities have been patched on the `main` branch, and the latest release `0.2.44` contains these patches. The provided commit details show the implementation of checks to prevent integer overflows when calculating buffer sizes.\n```",
