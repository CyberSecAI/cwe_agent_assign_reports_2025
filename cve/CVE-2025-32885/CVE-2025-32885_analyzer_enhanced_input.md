## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered on goTenna v1 devices with app 5.5.3 and firmware 0.25.5. The app there makes it possible to inject any custom message (into existing v1 networks) with any GID and Callsign via a software defined radio. This can be exploited if the device is being used in an unencrypted environment or if the cryptography has already been compromised.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** inject custom message with any GID and Callsign
- **product:** goTenna v1
- **version:** app 5.5.3, firmware 0.25.5

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-32885 based on provided content:

**CVE Description:** The provided content confirms the CVE description: An issue was discovered on goTenna v1 devices with app 5.5.3 and firmware 0.25.5. The app allows injection of custom messages (into existing v1 networks) with any GID and Callsign via a software defined radio. This can be exploited if the device is being used in an unencrypted environment or if the cryptography has already been compromised.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to inject custom messages with arbitrary GID and Callsign values using a software-defined radio.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Weak Authentication (CWE-1390).

**Impact of exploitation:** High confidentiality impact. An attacker can inject messages into the network.

**Attack vectors:** CVSS Score 6.5 - CVSS:3.1/AC:L/AV:A/A:N/C:H/I:N/PR:N/S:U/UI:N (Attack Complexity: Low, Attack Vector: Adjacent, Attack Requirements: None, Confidentiality Impact: High, Integrity Impact: None, Privileges Required: None, User Interaction: None).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** Adjacent network access and a software-defined radio.

**Mitigation or fix:** The vendor discontinued support for goTenna v1 in 2024. The vulnerability was reported in 2017 and 2018, and a fix was implemented for the goTenna Pro, but not for the v1.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   Affected Products: goTenna (v1) - goTenna App version 5.5.3, goTenna (v1) firmware version 0.25.5
*   The issue was discovered and reported in 2017 and 2018.
*   The vendor discontinued the entire civilian market, including goTenna v1 and Mesh devices.
