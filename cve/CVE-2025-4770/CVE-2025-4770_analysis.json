  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in PHPGurukul Park Ticketing Management System 2.0. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /view-normal-ticket.php. The manipulation of the argument viewid leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

The root cause lies in the fact that attackers can inject malicious code via the parameter \"viewid\". This input is then directly utilized in SQL queries without undergoing proper sanitization or validation processes.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    *   SQL injection\n*   **Impact of exploitation:**\n    *   Exploiting this SQL injection vulnerability allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to the database, cause sensitive data leakage, tamper with data, gain complete control over the system, and even disrupt services.\n*   **Attack vectors:**\n    *   Attackers can inject malicious code via the parameter \"viewid\".\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n    *   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable \"/view-normal-ticket.php\" file.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:**\n    *   Employ prepared statements and parameter binding\n    *   Conduct input validation and filtering\n```",
