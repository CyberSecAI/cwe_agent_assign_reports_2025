Verification:**\n\nThe content directly relates to CVE-2025-31122, as indicated by the \"CVE ID\" section in the second provided HTML snippet.\n\n**2. Extracted Information:**\n\n* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the generation of login links. It allows attackers to craft links that grant access to any account without proper authentication. Specifically, the vulnerability is related to a username parameter in the login link.\n* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    * CWE-177: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('Command Injection') - Implied by the ability to manipulate the username parameter.\n    * CWE-287: Improper Authentication - The login links bypass normal authentication procedures.\n    * CWE-290: Improper Input Validation - Lack of validation of the username parameter in the login link.\n* **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can gain unauthorized access to any user account. This includes high impact to Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of both the vulnerable system and subsequent systems.\n* **Attack vectors:** Network-based exploitation via crafted login links.\n* **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  No privileges required, passive user interaction (user clicking the malicious link). The attack complexity is rated as High.\n* **Mitigation or fix:** The content does not provide specific mitigation steps, but implies the need to fix the login link generation process to properly validate the username parameter and enforce proper authentication.\n\n**3. Additional Details (compared to a placeholder CVE description):**\n\nThe provided content offers significantly more detail than a placeholder CVE description would. It includes:\n\n*   A clear description of the vulnerability's functionality.\n*   CVSS v4 scoring and metrics, providing a quantitative assessment of severity.\n*   Specific CWE identifiers.\n*   Attribution of discovery to a specific researcher (@Fluffy728).\n*   A link to the related GitHub issue (#56).\n*   Detailed explanation of CVSS metrics.\n\n**4.

Given the evidence suggests a bypass of authentication through manipulation of a user-controlled key (the username), CWE-639 provides a more specific classification. However, the overarching issue remains an **improper authentication**, hence the inclusion of CWE-287 as a related weakness. Though CWE-287 is discouraged it is being included at a secondary level here to show the overall context.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    \n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** The application **fails to properly authenticate** users based on provided credentials, allowing manipulation of the username field.\n2.  **Weakness:** This leads to an **Authorization Bypass** because the system trusts the manipulated username without proper validation.\n3.  **Impact:** An attacker can **login to any account** by simply changing the username.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The description clearly indicates an issue with the authentication process, allowing unauthorized access to user accounts. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section highlights the **impact** of being able to \"login to any account\" and the **vector** of \"changing the username in the username field.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" reinforces this, stating that the vulnerability \"allows attackers to craft links that grant access to any account without proper authentication.\"\n\nThe Retriever results pointed to several potential CWEs, including CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key), and others related to injection and credential management.\n\nCWE-287 was initially considered as the primary CWE due to the explicit mention of \"improper authentication\" in the summary. However, CWE-287 is a Class-level CWE and the guidance discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available.\n\nCWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) provides a more precise description of the vulnerability, as it directly addresses the manipulation of the username parameter to bypass authorization checks. The vulnerability description clearly states that an attacker can \"login to any account by changing the username in the username field,\" which aligns with CWE-639's definition.\n\nTherefore, CWE-287 is being listed as a secondary candidate and CWE-639 as primary since it gives the most specific reason for the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
