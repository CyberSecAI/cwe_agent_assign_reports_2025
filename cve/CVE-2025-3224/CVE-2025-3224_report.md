# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-3224

## Description

A vulnerability in the update process of Docker Desktop for Windows versions prior to 4.41.0 could allow a local, low-privileged attacker to escalate privileges to SYSTEM. During an update, Docker Desktop attempts to delete files and subdirectories under the path C\\ProgramData\\Docker\\config with high privileges. However, this directory often does not exist by default, and C\\ProgramData\\ allows normal users to create new directories. By creating a malicious Docker\\config folder structure at this location, an attacker can force the privileged update process to delete or manipulate arbitrary system files, leading to Elevation of Privilege.

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-732 | Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource | 0.9 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE. The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors. |
| CWE-266 | Incorrect Privilege Assignment | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor. |
| CWE-250 | Execution with Unnecessary Privileges | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function. |
| CWE-59 | Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. The product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource. |
| CWE-367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | 0.4 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-732, which is a Class-level weakness. Several related CWEs were considered, including CWE-59, CWE-266, CWE-250, and CWE-367. CWE-59 (Improper Link Resolution Before File Access) is related because the attacker creates a directory structure, potentially using symbolic links or similar techniques, to manipulate the file deletion process. CWE-367 is relevant because the attacker exploits a race condition by creating the directory structure between the time the update process checks for the directory's existence and when it attempts to delete files within it. CWE-266 and CWE-250 are related due to the privilege escalation to SYSTEM. The update process runs with elevated privileges (CWE-250), and the attacker exploits the incorrect privilege assignment (CWE-266) to delete arbitrary system files.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect permission assignment** for the `C:\ProgramData\Docker\config` directory (CWE-732). Because this directory often doesn't exist by default, a low-privileged attacker can create it. The privileged update process then attempts to delete files and subdirectories within this attacker-controlled directory. This leads to the **execution with unnecessary privileges** (CWE-250) during the update process. If the attacker creates a malicious directory structure, this can result in arbitrary file deletion and privilege escalation. A **time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition** (CWE-367) could also exist, where the attacker creates the directory after the update process checks for its existence but before it attempts to delete files. The use of symlinks may lead to **improper link resolution** (CWE-59). Finally, the **incorrect privilege assignment** (CWE-266) during the update process allows the attacker to escalate privileges to SYSTEM.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference links. The primary weakness is the **incorrect permission assignment** (CWE-732) for the `C:\ProgramData\Docker\config` directory, allowing a low-privileged attacker to create it. The update process then attempts to delete files and subdirectories with elevated privileges, leading to arbitrary file deletion and privilege escalation.

The graph relationships influenced the selection of secondary CWEs, such as CWE-59, CWE-266, CWE-250, and CWE-367, which are related to the primary weakness.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-732 accurately represents the root cause of the vulnerability, while CWE-59, CWE-266, CWE-250, and CWE-367 describe related weaknesses that contribute to the overall vulnerability.
