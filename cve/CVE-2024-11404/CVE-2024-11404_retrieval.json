Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize file names, allowing attackers to bypass upload restrictions by appending a space to the file name.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n\\n1.  **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The application does not correctly validate file names, allowing for the bypass of file extension restrictions by adding a space at the end of the file name.\\n2.  **Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CWE-434):** The vulnerability enables the upload of files with dangerous types, such as HTML and SVG files, which are typically blocked.\\n3.  **Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS) (CWE-80):** By uploading HTML or SVG files, it\\'s possible to inject malicious scripts that execute in the user\\'s browser. This occurs because the application doesn\\'t correctly sanitize user-provided input.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n\\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:\\n\\n*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks:** By uploading malicious HTML or SVG files, attackers can inject client-side scripts that can steal cookies, redirect users, or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user, among other things.\\n*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (potentially):** While not directly stated, the uploaded HTML could contain malicious JavaScript which, if executed, could allow arbitrary code execution within the user\\'s browser depending on the context and capabilities of the browser environment.\\n*   **Compromised User Sessions:** Exploiting XSS can lead to session hijacking.\\n*   **Malware Distribution:** While the content indicates that uploaded files are not automatically executed on the server but rather downloaded and executed \"by hand on a local machine\", it is still possible to distribute malware to unsuspecting users via the application.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n\\n*   **File Upload Functionality:** The vulnerabilities are in the file upload mechanism of the `django-filer` application, specifically through the admin interface, accessible via `/admin/filer/folder/`.\\n*   **Filename Manipulation:** Attackers manipulate file names by appending a space character (%20) to bypass restrictions.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n\\n*   **Access to django CMS Admin Interface:** An attacker needs to have access to the django CMS admin interface to exploit the vulnerability.\\n*   **Ability to upload files:** Attackers must be able to upload files to the system.\\n\\n**Additional Details:**\\n\\n*   The vulnerability specifically affects `django-filer` version 3.2.3.\\n*   The vulnerability was discovered by Ali \u0130ltizar (iltosec).\\n*   The issue was reported through the project\\'s security email and fixed in django-filer version 3.3.0\\n*   The CVSS score is 5.5 (Medium severity)\\n\\nThe provided content gives more technical details than a typical CVE description, specifically including steps to reproduce the vulnerability along with screenshots.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold':
