The Retriever Results show that CWE-1220 has a high similarity score. Other CWEs like CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) were considered but deemed less specific. The vulnerability description explicitly states \"Insufficient granularity of access control\", which directly aligns with CWE-1220.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1220[\"CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe1220 --x|PEEROF| cwe863\n    cwe1220 --x|PEEROF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1220 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Insufficient granularity of access control** (CWE-1220).\n2.  **Impact:** Information Disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-1220 as the most appropriate CWE due to the explicit mention of \"**Insufficient granularity of access control**\" in the vulnerability description. The Retriever Results further supported this by ranking CWE-1220 with the highest similarity score. Other candidate CWEs, such as CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), were considered, but they are less specific and do not accurately reflect the root cause. The final decision is strongly based on the evidence provided and the relationships between the CWEs. CWE-1220 is at the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements access controls via a policy or other feature with the intention to disable or restrict accesses (reads and/or writes) to assets in a system from untrusted agents. However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThe vulnerability description matches the CWE description as the Visual Studio access controls lack the required granularity. This allows an authorized attacker to disclose information locally.\n\n## CWE-1296: Incorrect Chaining or Granularity of Debug Components\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.47\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-1296: Incorrect Chaining or Granularity of Debug Components\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis CWE was considered but deemed not applicable as the vulnerability description does not mention debug components.\n\n## CWE-1254: Incorrect Comparison Logic Granularity\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.47\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-1254: Incorrect Comparison Logic Granularity\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nThis CWE was considered but deemed not applicable as the vulnerability description does not mention comparison logic.\n\n## CWE-284: Improper Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1147.14\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform an authorization check or incorrectly performs one.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-284 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n\nThis CWE was considered but is too general. CWE-1220 is a more specific description of the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1147.14\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\nThis CWE was considered but deemed not as accurate as CWE-1220.
