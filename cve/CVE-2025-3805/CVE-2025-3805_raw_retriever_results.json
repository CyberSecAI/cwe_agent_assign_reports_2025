Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file check_id.py of the component Jinja2 Template Handler. The manipulation of the argument ID leads to injection. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This product does not use versioning. This is why information about affected and unaffected releases are unavailable.",
