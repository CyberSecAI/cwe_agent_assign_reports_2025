Affected devices **do not properly handle TCP packets with an incorrect structure**. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition. To restore normal operations, the network cable of the device needs to be unplugge

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **do not properly handle TCP packets with an incorrect structure**
- **impact:** denial of service condition
- **attacker:** unauthenticated remote attacker
- **product:** SIMATIC S7-200 SMART CPU
- **version:** All versions and All versions and All versions and All versions and All versions and All versions and All versions and All versions and All versions and All versions and All versions and All versions and All versions and All versions and All versions and All versions and All versions and All versions and All versions

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected devices do not properly handle TCP packets with an incorrect structure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of TCP packets with incorrect structure leading to uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a denial of service condition, requiring a manual restart (unplugging and re-plugging the network cable) to restore normal operations.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted TCP packet to the vulnerable device via network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device. They do not need to be authenticated.
