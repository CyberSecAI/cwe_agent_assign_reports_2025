# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-9472

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-9472

## Description

A **null pointer dereference** in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software on PA-800 Series, PA-3200 Series, PA-5200 Series, and PA-7000 Series hardware platforms when Decryption policy is enabled allows an unauthenticated attacker to crash PAN-OS by sending specific traffic through the data plane, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Repeated attempts to trigger this condition will result in PAN-OS entering maintenance mode. Palo Alto Networks VM-Series, Cloud NGFW, and Prisma Access are not affected. This issue only affects PA-800 Series, PA-3200 Series, PA-5200 Series, and PA-7000 Series running these specific versions of PAN-OS * 10.2.7-h12 * 10.2.8-h10 * 10.2.9-h9 * 10.2.9-h11 * 10.2.10-h2 * 10.2.10-h3 * 10.2.11 * 10.2.11-h1 * 10.2.11-h2 * 10.2.11-h3 * 11.1.2-h9 * 11.1.2-h12 * 11.1.3-h2 * 11.1.3-h4 * 11.1.3-h6 * 11.2.2 * 11.2.2-h1

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-476 | NULL Pointer Dereference | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability is caused by a **null pointer dereference** which leads to a crash. |
| CWE-703 | Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions | 0.6 | Pillar | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. The description indicates an exceptional condition is not properly handled, but CWE-476 is more specific. |
| CWE-755 | Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions | 0.5 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. Similar to CWE-703, it describes improper handling of exceptional conditions, but CWE-476 is a more precise root cause. |
| CWE-390 | Detection of Error Condition Without Action | 0.4 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The system detects a null pointer but doesn't take appropriate action. |
| CWE-754 | Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions | 0.4 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary candidate. The system does not properly check for exceptional conditions. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain of events is:

1.  **Root Cause:** **Null pointer dereference** (CWE-476) due to specific traffic being processed when decryption policy is enabled.
2.  **Impact:** PAN-OS crash and denial of service (DoS). Repeated attempts cause PAN-OS to enter maintenance mode.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability is a **null pointer dereference**, which directly maps to CWE-476. The evidence from the vulnerability description key phrases and CVE reference links content summary clearly points to this root cause. The other CWEs considered, such as CWE-703 and CWE-755, are more general and less specific than CWE-476. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-476 is the most accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability. The selection of CWE-476 is at the optimal level of specificity, being a Base level CWE.

The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
