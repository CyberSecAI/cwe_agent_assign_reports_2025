  "description": "An issue was discovered in Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) 10.1.x before 10.1.1, 10.0.x before 10.0.9, 9.0.0 before Patch 41, and 8.8.15 before Patch 46. It allows authenticated users to exploit **Server-Side Request Forgery** (SSRF) due to **improper input sanitization and misconfigured domain whitelisting**. This issue permits unauthorized HTTP requests to be sent to internal services, which can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) by chaining **Command Injection** within the internal service. When combined with existing **XSS** vulnerabilities, this SSRF issue can further facilitate Remote Code Execution (RCE).",
