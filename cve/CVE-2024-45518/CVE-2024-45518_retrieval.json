It allows authenticated users to exploit **Server-Side Request Forgery** (SSRF) due to **improper input sanitization and misconfigured domain whitelisting**. This issue permits unauthorized HTTP requests to be sent to internal services, which can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) by chaining **Command Injection** within the internal service. When combined with existing **XSS** vulnerabilities, this SSRF issue can further facilitate Remote Code Execution (RCE).', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'improper input sanitization and misconfigured

It allows authenticated users to exploit **Server-Side Request Forgery** (SSRF) due to **improper input sanitization and misconfigured domain whitelisting**. This issue permits unauthorized HTTP requests to be sent to internal services, which can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) by chaining **Command Injection** within the internal service. When combined with existing **XSS** vulnerabilities, this SSRF issue can further facilitate Remote Code Execution (RCE).\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'improper input sanitization and misconfigured domain whitelisting'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
