  "description": "This openedx-translations repository contains translation files from Open edX repositories to be kept in sync with Transifex. Before moving to pulling translations from the openedx-translations repository via openedx-atlas, translations in the edx-platform repository were validated using edx-i18n-tools. This validation included protection against malformed translations and translations-based script injections. Prior to this patch, the validation implemented in the openedx-translations repository did not include the same protections. The maintainer inspected the translations in the edx-platform directory of both the main and open-release/redwood.master branches of the openedx-translations repository and found no evidence of exploited translation strings.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-43782:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation for translations within the `openedx-translations` repository before being integrated into the `edx-platform`. Previously, `edx-platform` used `edx-i18n-tools` to validate translations which provided protection against malformed translations and script injection. However, when the project shifted to using `openedx-translations` via `openedx-atlas`, this validation was initially missing.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Missing Translation Validation:** The primary weakness is the absence of robust validation on translations in `openedx-translations` before their use in `edx-platform`. This includes checks against malformed translations, invalid brace formats and potentially malicious script injections.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Confidentiality:** A successful exploit could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data through the injection of malicious code or by manipulating the displayed text to trick users into providing personal information.\n- **Integrity:** Malicious translations could be used to alter the behavior or appearance of the application, leading to incorrect or harmful actions.\n- **Availability:** While not directly impacting availability, manipulated translations could make the application difficult or confusing to use, impacting usability. The CVSS score indicates that availability is not impacted.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based as the malicious translations would need to be introduced into the system over the network.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Low Privileges:** An attacker with low privileges could potentially introduce malicious translations.\n- **User Interaction:** The attacker requires some user interaction as the malicious translations would need to be loaded and displayed in order to trigger the vulnerability.\n- **Attack Complexity High:** It's considered a high complexity attack.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.7, considered high. The CVSS metrics are broken down, showing a network attack vector with high confidentiality and integrity impact and a changed scope.\n- **Patches:** The issue has been addressed by integrating `edx-i18n-tools` into the `openedx-translations` repository, specifically through the commits `b244434` and `3c40937`.\n\nIn summary, this CVE highlights a vulnerability due to inadequate translation validation that could allow for script injections and other forms of attacks. The fix involved reintroducing the validation mechanism from the `edx-i18n-tools`.",

CWE-79 is a potential consequence of this **improper validation**, as it could lead to cross-site scripting vulnerabilities due to script injections. CWE-1286 is a base-level CWE which is a preferred level of abstraction.

This led to the selection of CWE-1286 as the primary CWE. The secondary CWE, CWE-79, was selected due to the potential for script injection as a consequence of the **improper validation**.\n\nThe evidence supporting this assessment is derived from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" which indicates \"**rootcause:** **improper validation of translations**\" and \"**vector:** script injection\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states, \"The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation for translations within the `openedx-translations` repository before being integrated into the `edx-platform`,\" and \"This includes checks against malformed translations, invalid brace formats and potentially malicious script injections.\"\n\nThe relationship graph shows how the **improper validation** (CWE-1286) can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79) through script injection. Both CWEs are at the base level of abstraction, which is desirable.\n\nThe retriever results also show CWE-79 as a potential candidate.\n\nCWE-20 \"Improper Input Validation\" was considered but not used because it is a Class-level CWE and is discouraged when more specific CWEs are available.
