  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-35177', description='Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. It is capable of protecting workloads across on-premises, virtualized, containerized, and cloud-based environments. The wazuh-agent for Windows is vulnerable to a Local **Privilege Escalation vulnerability** due to **improper ACL of the non-default installation directory**. A local malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability by placing one of the many DLL that are loaded and not present on the system in the installation folder of the agent OR by replacing the service executable binary itself with a malicious one. The root cause is an **improper ACL applied on the installation folder when a non-default installation path is specified** (e.g, C\\\\\\\\wazuh). Many DLLs are loaded from the installation folder and by creating a malicious DLLs that exports the functions of a legit one (and that is not found on the system where the agent is installed, such as rsync.dll) it is possible to escalate privileges from a low-privileged user and obtain code execution under the context of NT AUTHORITY\\\\\\\\SYSTEM. This issue has been addressed in version 4.9.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.', key_phrases={'rootcause': ['improper ACL applied on the installation folder when a non-default installation path is specified', 'improper ACL of the non-default installation directory'], 'weakness': 'Privilege Escalation vulnerability', 'impact': ['Local Privilege Escalation', 'escalate privileges'], 'vector': 'placing DLL that are loaded and not present on the system in the installation folder OR replacing the service executable binary itself', 'attacker': 'local malicious user', 'product': 'wazuh-agent', 'version': 'Windows', 'component': ''}, reference_content='## Analysis of CVE-2024-35177 Content\\n\\nThis content **IS RELATED** to CVE-2024-35177. It provides significantly more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\\n\\nHere\\'s an extraction of the relevant information:\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\n\\n*   Improper ACL applied on the installation folder when a non-default installation path is specified.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n\\n*   Improper Access Control (CWE-284)\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n\\n*   Local Privilege Escalation to the context of NT AUTHORITY\\\\\\\\SYSTEM.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n\\n*   Placing a malicious DLL in the installation folder that exports functions of a legitimate DLL not present on the system (e.g., rsync.dll).\\n*   Replacing the `wazuh-agent.exe` binary with a malicious one.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n\\n*   Local access to the system.\\n*   Writable access to the non-default installation directory.\\n*   Ability to restart the \"Wazuh\" service (either through permissions or system reboot).\\n\\n**Mitigation or fix:**\\n\\n*   Patched versions: >= 4.9.0\\n*   The advisory does not explicitly state the fix, but it implies correcting the ACLs on the installation directory.\\n\\n**Additional Details:**\\n\\n*   **Affected versions:** >=3.0.0\\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.8 (High)\\n*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\\n*

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. It is capable of protecting workloads across on-premises, virtualized, containerized, and cloud-based environments. The wazuh-agent for Windows is vulnerable to a Local **Privilege Escalation vulnerability** due to **improper ACL of the non-default installation directory**. A local malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability by placing one of the many DLL that are loaded and not present on the system in the installation folder of the agent OR by replacing the service executable binary itself with a malicious one. The root cause is an **improper ACL applied on the installation folder when a non-default installation path is specified** (e.g, C\\\\wazuh). Many DLLs are loaded from the installation folder and by creating a malicious DLLs that exports the functions of a legit one (and that is not found on the system where the agent is installed, such as rsync.dll) it is possible to escalate privileges from a low-privileged user and obtain code execution under the context of NT AUTHORITY\\\\SYSTEM. This issue has been addressed in version 4.9.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'improper ACL applied on the installation folder when a non-default installation path is specified'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
