This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of Samsung SmartThings. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the Hub Local API service, which listens on TCP port 8766 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper verification of a cryptographic signature. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass authentication on the system. Was ZDI-CAN-25615.",

CWE-287 is a parent Class of CWE-347, representing a broader category of authentication issues. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **lack of proper verification of a cryptographic signature**, making CWE-347 the most specific and appropriate choice. The hierarchical relationship informs us that while authentication is impacted (CWE-287), the root cause is a specific type of authentication failure (CWE-347).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper verification of the cryptographic signature** (CWE-347), which leads to the ability to bypass authentication (CWE-287). The attack vector is network-adjacent attackers exploiting the Hub Local API service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points towards CWE-347 due to the explicit mention of the **lack of proper verification of cryptographic signature**. The vulnerability description states, \"The issue results from the lack of proper verification of a cryptographic signature. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass authentication on the system.\"\n\nCWE-287 (Improper Authentication) was considered as a secondary weakness because the impact of the vulnerability is authentication bypass. However, the root cause is the cryptographic signature verification failure, making CWE-347 the primary and more specific choice.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision by illustrating the hierarchical connection between the root cause (CWE-347) and the higher-level authentication failure (CWE-287). Selecting CWE-347 provides a more accurate and granular representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism
