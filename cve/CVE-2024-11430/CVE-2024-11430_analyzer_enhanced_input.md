## Vulnerability Description
The SQL Chart Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the arg1 arg of the gvn_schart_2 shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.6 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**
- **weakness:** **SQL injection**
- **impact:** extract sensitive information from the database
- **vector:** arg1 of gvn_schart_2 shortcode
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access and above
- **product:** SQL Chart Builder plugin for WordPress
- **version:** all versions up to and including 2.3.6

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11430

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and lack of proper preparation of the SQL query within the 'gvn_schart_2' shortcode of the SQL Chart Builder plugin. Specifically, the 'arg1' parameter is not properly escaped.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `arg1` parameter passed to the `gvn_schart_2` shortcode.
- **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The SQL query does not use prepared statements, which would prevent SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** An attacker could extract sensitive information from the database by appending malicious SQL queries to the existing ones.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Manipulation:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious `gvn_schart_2` shortcode with a specially crafted `arg1` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** Attackers need to have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `guaven_sqlcharts_local_shortcode` function within the `functions.php` file, specifically lines 468-469:
```php
for($i=1;$i<20;$i++){ $replacearg=!empty($atts["arg".$i])?$atts["arg".$i]:0;
$sql=str_replace("{arg".$i."}",esc_sql($replacearg),$sql);}
```
- This code iterates through `arg1` to `arg19` parameters, replaces placeholders in the SQL query, and uses `esc_sql` function for sanitization. However, this is not sufficient to prevent SQL injection.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the SQL Chart Builder plugin up to and including 2.3.7.1.
- There is no known patch available for this vulnerability.
- The Wordfence Intelligence team recommends uninstalling the affected software and finding a replacement.
