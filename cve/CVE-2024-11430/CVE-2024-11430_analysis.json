  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11430\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and lack of proper preparation of the SQL query within the 'gvn_schart_2' shortcode of the SQL Chart Builder plugin. Specifically, the 'arg1' parameter is not properly escaped.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **SQL Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.\n- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `arg1` parameter passed to the `gvn_schart_2` shortcode.\n- **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The SQL query does not use prepared statements, which would prevent SQL injection.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** An attacker could extract sensitive information from the database by appending malicious SQL queries to the existing ones.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Shortcode Manipulation:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious `gvn_schart_2` shortcode with a specially crafted `arg1` parameter.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Authenticated Access:** Attackers need to have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- The vulnerability lies in the `guaven_sqlcharts_local_shortcode` function within the `functions.php` file, specifically lines 468-469:\n```php\nfor($i=1;$i<20;$i++){ $replacearg=!empty($atts[\"arg\".$i])?$atts[\"arg\".$i]:0;\n$sql=str_replace(\"{arg\".$i.\"}\",esc_sql($replacearg),$sql);}\n```\n- This code iterates through `arg1` to `arg19` parameters, replaces placeholders in the SQL query, and uses `esc_sql` function for sanitization. However, this is not sufficient to prevent SQL injection.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerability affects all versions of the SQL Chart Builder plugin up to and including 2.3.7.1.\n- There is no known patch available for this vulnerability.\n- The Wordfence Intelligence team recommends uninstalling the affected software and finding a replacement.",

CWE-89 is a Base level CWE, providing a specific description of the **improper neutralization of special elements in an SQL command**, which aligns directly with the vulnerability's root cause. CWE-116 was considered due to the mention of **insufficient escaping**, but it is a Class-level CWE and less specific than CWE-89.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe116\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe116 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient escaping and lack of sufficient preparation of the SQL query** (CWE-89). This leads to the ability to inject malicious SQL code. The impact of this injection is the extraction of sensitive information from the database.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-89 as the primary weakness due to the clear presence of **SQL injection** stemming from **insufficient input sanitization and lack of prepared statements**. The evidence for this is strong, with the vulnerability description and CVE reference content directly stating these issues. While CWE-116 was considered as a secondary candidate due to the mention of escaping, CWE-89 provides a more accurate and specific classification of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description, specifically the phrases \"**insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**\" and the resulting \"**SQL injection**\".

        "extended_description": "\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n",
