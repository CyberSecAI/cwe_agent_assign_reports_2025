## Description

An issue was discovered in Kwik before 0.10.1. A hash collision vulnerability (in the hash table used to manage connections) allows remote attackers to cause a considerable CPU load on the server (a Hash DoS attack) by initiating connections with colliding Source Connection IDs (SCIDs).

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Vector:** initiating connections with colliding Source Connection IDs
- **Weakness:** hash collision vulnerability, weakness in hash table
- **Product:** Kwik
- **Impact:** Hash DoS attack
- **Attacker:** remote attackers
- **Version:** before 0.10.1

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-407 | Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity | 0.9 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE. The vulnerability stems from the **inefficient algorithmic complexity** of the hash table, which leads to a Hash DoS attack. |
| CWE-328 | Use of Weak Hash | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The **weakness** is explicitly stated as a **hash collision vulnerability** and the use of **weak hash functions** in connection ID management. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-407, which is a Class-level CWE indicating a general algorithmic inefficiency. CWE-328 is a Base-level CWE that specifies the use of a weak hash algorithm, which can lead to collisions and DoS attacks. CWE-328 is related to CWE-407 because a weak hash function is a common cause of inefficient algorithmic complexity in hash table implementations.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a weak hash** (CWE-328), leading to **hash collisions**. These collisions then cause **inefficient algorithmic complexity** (CWE-407) in the hash table, ultimately resulting in a **Hash DoS attack** which is the impact.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified CWE-407 as the primary weakness due to the **inefficient algorithmic complexity** leading to the DoS. Supporting evidence includes the vulnerability description mentioning a **hash collision vulnerability** and the CVE reference summary stating that the vulnerability stems from the use of **weak hash functions**.

CWE-328 was considered because the **weak hash** is the underlying cause for the **hash collisions**, but CWE-407 was preferred as the primary CWE because it directly represents the **inefficient algorithmic complexity**, which is the root cause for the denial-of-service.

The relationship analysis shows that CWE-328 can lead to CWE-407, further solidifying the choice of CWE-407 as the primary issue.

The final selection of CWE-407 and CWE-328 provides an optimal level of specificity by identifying both the high-level algorithmic issue and the underlying cause related to the hash function.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
An algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error
**Abstraction Level**: Base
