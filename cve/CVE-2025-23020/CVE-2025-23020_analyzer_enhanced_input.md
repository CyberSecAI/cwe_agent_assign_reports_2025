## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in Kwik before 0.10.1. A hash collision vulnerability (in the hash table used to manage connections) allows remote attackers to cause a considerable CPU load on the server (a Hash DoS attack) by initiating connections with colliding Source Connection IDs (SCIDs).

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **vector:** initiating connections with colliding Source Connection IDs
- **weakness:** **hash collision vulnerability, weakness in hash table**
- **product:** Kwik
- **impact:** Hash DoS attack
- **attacker:** remote attackers
- **version:** before 0.10.1

```text
The provided content is a technical advisory regarding a Hash Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack in multiple QUIC implementations. It identifies several vulnerable libraries and provides details about the attack.

The following implementations are listed as vulnerable:
*   [kwik](https://github.com/ptrd/kwik) 0.10.0 and all earlier versions (fixed in 0.10.1), tracked under CVE-2025-23020

The advisory explains that the vulnerability exploits algorithmic complexity of hash tables when pushing them to their worst-case complexity. It mentions the use of weak hash functions in connection ID management within QUIC implementations.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of weak hash functions in the QUIC implementations for managing connections, specifically when using peer Source Connection IDs (SCIDs).
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Hash DoS attacks due to the use of weak hash functions for connection ID management.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Significantly slow down vulnerable servers by forcing them to spend the majority of their computing power inserting and looking up colliding connection IDs. Experimental results showed a factor 300 slowdown with 10k parallel connections.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker can freely choose Source Connection IDs (SCIDs) that collide under the target hash function.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to initiate QUIC connections and control the Source Connection ID.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** The advisory states that kwik 0.10.1 has fixed this vulnerability.
