CWE-321 is a variant of CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials), which in turn is related to broader authentication issues. Since the vulnerability specifically involves a cryptographic key, the more specific CWE-321 was chosen. CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) was considered because the **static key** allows bypassing authentication, but it's a higher-level class.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe798 -->|RELATEDTO| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe287 secondary\n    class cwe798 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a static JWT secret key** (CWE-321). This leads to a bypass of authentication mechanisms, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to SOAR API endpoints. The root cause is the **static key**, and the impact is the potential for unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is strongly based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description's key phrase \"**static JWT secret key**\" and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states, \"The Logpoint SOAR component uses a **static JWT secret key** for generating tokens, which allows access to SOAR API endpoints without authentication.\" This clearly indicates the use of a hard-coded cryptographic key.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision to choose the most specific CWE, CWE-321, over its parent CWE-798 or related authentication CWEs.
