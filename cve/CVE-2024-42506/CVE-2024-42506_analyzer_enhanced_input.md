## Vulnerability Description
**Command injection** vulnerabilities in the underlying CLI service could lead to unauthenticated remote code execution by sending specially crafted packets destined to the PAPI (Arubas Access Point management protocol) UDP port (8211). Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities results in the ability to execute arbitrary code as a privileged user on the underlying operating system.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **Command injection**
- **impact:** execute arbitrary code and unauthenticated remote code execution
- **vector:** specially crafted packets
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attacker
- **product:** Aruba Access Point
- **component:** PAPI (Aruba's Access Point management protocol) UDP port
