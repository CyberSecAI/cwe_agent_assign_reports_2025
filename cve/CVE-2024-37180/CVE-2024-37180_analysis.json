However, after carefully analyzing the vulnerability description and the provided guidance, CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) emerged as the most appropriate primary CWE because the vulnerability lies in allowing access to a remote-enabled function module without proper authorization checks. The description clearly states an **attacker** can \"access remote-enabled function module with no further authorization which would otherwise be restricted.\" This points directly to a **missing authorization** check. CWE-200 was considered because the **attacker** can \"read non-sensitive information,\" but the primary issue is the **missing authorization**, so that is the first step in the chain. The evidence is directly from the vulnerability description: \"allows an attacker to access remote-enabled function module with no further authorization.\" The selection of CWE-862 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it precisely captures the **missing authorization** aspect of the vulnerability. The graph relationships helped in understanding the hierarchy of access control-related CWEs and in choosing the most specific CWE that accurately reflects the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
