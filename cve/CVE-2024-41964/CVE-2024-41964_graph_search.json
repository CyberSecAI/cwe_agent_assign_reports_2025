Permissions for creating and deleting languages have already existed and could be configured, but were not enforced by Kirbys frontend or backend code. A permission for updating existing languages has not existed before the patched versions. So disabling the languages.* wildcard permission for a role could not have prohibited updates to existing language definitions.

There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-863 CWE-862 CWE-1336 CWE-352 CWE-285 CWE-184 CWE-209",
