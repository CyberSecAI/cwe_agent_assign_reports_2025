  "description": "Kirby is a CMS targeting designers and editors. Kirby allows to restrict the permissions of specific user roles. Users of that role can only perform permitted actions. Permissions for creating and deleting languages have already existed and could be configured, but were not enforced by Kirbys frontend or backend code. A permission for updating existing languages has not existed before the patched versions. So disabling the languages.* wildcard permission for a role could not have prohibited updates to existing language definitions. The **missing permission checks** allowed attackers with Panel access to manipulate the language definitions. The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.6.6.6, Kirby 3.7.5.5, Kirby 3.8.4.4, Kirby 3.9.8.2, Kirby 3.10.1.1, and Kirby 4.3.1. Please update to one of these or a later version to fix the vulnerability. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-41964:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is the lack of sufficient permission checks in the language settings of the Kirby CMS. Specifically, the application did not enforce permissions for creating, deleting, and, crucially, updating language definitions. Although permissions for language creation and deletion existed, they were not enforced in the frontend or backend code.  A permission for updating languages did not exist prior to the patch.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Missing Authorization Checks:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper authorization checks when modifying language definitions. This allowed authenticated users to perform actions (create, update, delete languages) without proper permission verification.\n*   **Incomplete Permissions Model:** The permission system lacked a specific permission for updating language settings, leaving it vulnerable to unauthorized changes.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could have significant consequences:\n\n*   **Multi-language Mode Manipulation:** An attacker could enable multi-language mode by creating the first language, or switch to single-language mode by deleting all languages if the `languages` option was enabled.\n*   **Content Loss:** Deleting existing languages would result in the loss of all translated content associated with that language.\n*   **Language Metadata Manipulation:** An attacker could modify language metadata, including the language slug (affecting page URLs) and language variables, potentially impacting the site's functionality, appearance, or SEO.\n*   **Default Language Change:** Updating a language could allow an attacker to change the default language, leading to the site using the new default language's content as a fallback, potentially showing the wrong content to site visitors.\n*   **Site Unavailability or Integrity Issues:** Depending on the site's code, these modifications could lead to site errors, broken links, or other integrity-related problems.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Panel Access:** The primary attack vector is through the Kirby Panel, which requires user authentication.\n*   **Network:** The attack vector is classified as \"Network,\" implying that the attacker can be remote (logically and physically) when exploiting the vulnerability.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the Kirby Panel.\n*   **Low Privileges:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a user with relatively low privileges who has not been specifically granted the `languages.create`, `languages.delete`, and `languages.update` permissions because these checks were not enforced.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was present in Kirby versions <=3.6.6.5, 3.7.0-3.7.5.4, 3.8.0-3.8.4.3, 3.9.0-3.9.8.1, 3.10.0-3.10.1, and 4.0.0-4.3.0.\n*   It was patched in versions 3.6.6.6, 3.7.5.5, 3.8.4.4, 3.9.8.2, 3.10.1.1, and 4.3.1 by enforcing the existing permission checks and adding the new `languages.update` permission.\n*   The issue is identified as CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization).\n*   The CVSS v3 score is 8.1, with a base metric vector of AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H.\n\nThe provided content gives a detailed explanation of the vulnerability and is consistent with the nature of CVE-2024-41964.",
