## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in D-Link DNS-320 2.02b01. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /cgi-bin/widget_api.cgi of the component Web Management Interface. The manipulation of the argument getHD/getSer/getSys leads to information disclosure. The attack may be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. NOTE This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. Vendor was contacted early and confirmed that the product is end-of-life. It should be retired and replaced.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities, though it's important to note that this content is related to CVE-2024-3272 and CVE-2024-3273, not CVE-2024-8460:

**Vulnerability Summary (based on CVE-2024-3272 and CVE-2024-3273 information):**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerabilities stem from command injection flaws in the CGI scripts used by the web configuration interface of D-Link NAS devices and information disclosure via a hidden interface that lacks authentication/authorization.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Command Injection:**  The web interface's CGI scripts are susceptible to command injection, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the device.
    *  **Information Disclosure:** A hidden web interface exposes sensitive hardware information without requiring authentication or authorization.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Command Injection:** Attackers could gain full control of the affected devices, potentially leading to data breaches, malware installation, denial of service, and other malicious activities.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain sensitive hardware information, potentially aiding in further attacks or exposing device details.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Command Injection:** Remote exploitation is possible via specially crafted requests to the web interface's CGI scripts.
   *   **Information Disclosure:** Remote exploitation is possible by accessing the vulnerable URL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web interface of the affected D-Link NAS devices. This implies network connectivity to the device.

**Additional Notes:**
* The affected D-Link devices are legacy products that have reached their End of Life (EOL) or End of Service Life (EOS). D-Link has stopped providing software updates and security patches for these devices.
* The advisory strongly recommends that users retire and replace these devices due to the lack of security support.
* The advisory mentions multiple sources reporting the vulnerabilities, including VulDB, Netsefish, BuaaIOTTeam, and IoT-Vuls.
*  Vulnerable firmware versions include at least DNS-320_A1_FW_2.02b01.
*  The information disclosure vulnerability is described as allowing attackers to access sensitive information from a hidden interface without any permission. Specifically, the information exposed through `/cgi-bin/widget_api.cgi` includes details about the hard drives, serial numbers, and system information.

**In summary, the content describes command injection and information disclosure vulnerabilities in D-Link NAS devices that have reached their end of life. The advisory strongly urges users to replace these devices due to lack of security support.**

**Response:**
This content is related to CVE-2024-3272 and CVE-2024-3273, not CVE-2024-8460.
