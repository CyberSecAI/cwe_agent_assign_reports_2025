## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Root cause of vulnerability:
- IDOR vulnerability allowed authenticated users to create or modify listings under unauthorized accounts.
- Stored XSS vulnerability existed because the name parameter of a listing could execute malicious scripts when rendered in the calendar view.
- Host Header Poisoning vulnerability allowed crafted Host headers to manipulate redirects.
- Slowloris DoS vulnerability targeted Nginx, keeping connections open indefinitely.
- Information disclosure issue included server version details in HTTP response headers.
- Missing security flags on authentication cookies.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Host Header Poisoning
- Slowloris Denial-of-Service (DoS)
- Information Disclosure
- Missing security flags on authentication cookies (CSRF risk)

Impact of exploitation:
- IDOR: Unauthorized access to listings, creation or modification of listings under other accounts.
- XSS: Execution of malicious scripts in the calendar view.
- Host Header Poisoning: Phishing attacks via malicious domains through manipulated redirects.
- Slowloris DoS: Server resource exhaustion and service outages.
- Information Disclosure: Increased risk of targeted reconnaissance and exploitation.
- Missing security flags: Theft of authentication cookies and CSRF attacks.

Attack vectors:
- IDOR: Authenticated user exploiting direct object references.
- XSS: Crafting malicious scripts within the listing name parameter.
- Host Header Poisoning: Sending crafted Host headers.
- Slowloris DoS: Sending incomplete HTTP requests to keep connections open.
- Information Disclosure: Analyzing HTTP response headers.
- Missing security flags: Client-side scripts accessing cookies, or CSRF attacks.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- IDOR: Authenticated user.
- XSS: Ability to control the listing name parameter.
- Host Header Poisoning: Ability to send crafted HTTP requests.
- Slowloris DoS: Ability to send a high volume of incomplete HTTP requests.
- Information Disclosure: Ability to intercept and analyze HTTP responses.
- Missing security flags: Ability to execute client-side scripts or launch CSRF attacks.

Mitigation or fix:
