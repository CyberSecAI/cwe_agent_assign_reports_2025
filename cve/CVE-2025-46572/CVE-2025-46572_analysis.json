  "description": "passport-wsfed-saml2 provides passport strategy for both WS-fed and SAML2 protocol. A vulnerability present starting in version 3.0.5 up to and including version 4.6.3 allows an attacker to impersonate any user during SAML authentication by crafting a SAMLResponse. This can be done by using a valid SAML object that was signed by the configured IdP. Users are affected specifically when the service provider is using passport-wsfed-saml2 and a valid SAML document signed by the Identity Provider can be obtained. Version 4.6.4 contains a fix for the vulnerability.",

This is directly related to the vulnerability where the SAML response signature is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious response. CWE-347 is a child of CWE-345, Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity, indicating a broader class of data validation issues. CWE-287 Improper Authentication, CWE-1390 Weak Authentication and CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization were considered as alternative high level classifications, however, CWE-347 provides a more specific root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe345,cwe287,cwe1390,cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper verification of the cryptographic signature** (CWE-347). This leads to the ability to **impersonate any user** during SAML authentication. The root cause is the flawed signature validation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary assessment focuses on **CWE-347 Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature** as the root cause. The vulnerability description explicitly states that an attacker can impersonate any user by crafting a SAMLResponse and using a valid SAML object signed by the configured IdP. This directly implies that the signature verification is either missing or flawed. The evidence \"This vulnerability allows an attacker to impersonate any user during SAML authentication by crafting a SAMLResponse. This can be done by using a valid SAML object that was signed by the configured IdP.\" strongly supports this.\n\n**CWE-347** is at the Base level of abstraction, providing a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability compared to higher-level classes such as **CWE-287 Improper Authentication**, **CWE-1390 Weak Authentication** and **CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization**. The retriever results also list CWE-347 as a relevant candidate, further solidifying its selection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
