  "description": "The Hash Elements plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a **missing capability check** on the hash_elements_get_posts_title_by_id() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve draft post titles that should not be accessible to unauthenticated users.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   The `hash_elements_get_posts_title_by_id()` function in the Hash Elements plugin lacks a capability check.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Missing Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of a proper authorization check within the `hash_elements_get_posts_title_by_id()` function. This function retrieves post titles based on provided IDs.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Unauthenticated Draft Post Title Exposure:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to retrieve draft post titles that should not be accessible to unauthorized users. This can lead to information disclosure.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, as it involves sending HTTP requests to the affected function.\n*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the WordPress site where the vulnerable plugin is installed.\n*   No special user privileges or credentials are required.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was present in versions of the plugin up to and including 1.4.7.\n*   Version 1.4.8 of the plugin addresses this vulnerability.\n*   The fix involved adding a capability check (`current_user_can('manage_options')`) to the `hash_elements_get_posts_title_by_id()` function, ensuring only users with the 'manage_options' capability can execute it.\n\nThis information is more detailed than the placeholder CVE description.",

CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** is a class-level CWE. There may be a more specific base-level CWE that is a child of CWE-862, but without more information, CWE-862 is the most appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n\n    cwe201 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing capability check** (CWE-862 **Missing Authorization**), which leads to the exposure of sensitive information (CWE-201 **Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data**).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the **missing capability check** as a key factor. The retriever results and the provided information strongly support CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** as the primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the `hash_elements_get_posts_title_by_id()` function lacks a capability check, which allows unauthenticated attackers to access draft post titles. CWE-201 **Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data** is a potential secondary weakness, as the unauthorized access leads to the exposure of sensitive post titles. The final selection is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the retriever results. CWE-862 is chosen as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **missing authorization** check. CWE-201 is chosen because of the impact: the exposure of draft post titles.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n*Not Selected:* CSRF requires a logged-in user to be tricked into performing actions.
