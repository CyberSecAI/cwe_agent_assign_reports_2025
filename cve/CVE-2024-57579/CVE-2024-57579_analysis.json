The **weakness** is a classic stack-based buffer overflow. CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) is the most appropriate CWE because it directly reflects the **stack overflow** condition.

This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation.

This CWE entry is only appropriate for \"Buffer Copy\" operations (not buffer reads), in which where there is no \"Checking [the] Size of Input\", and (by implication of the copy) writing past the end of the buffer.\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 405.74\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.\n\nCWE-120 was considered but not used because the vulnerability description does not explicitly mention copying a buffer without checking its size. It simply states a **stack overflow** exists, so a more specific CWE is more appropriate. CWE-119 is too general and discouraged when more specific CWEs are available.
