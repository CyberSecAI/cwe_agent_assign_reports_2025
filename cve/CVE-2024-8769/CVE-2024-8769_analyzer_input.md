# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-8769

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the `LockManager.release_locks` function in aimhubio/aim (commit bb76afe) allows for arbitrary file deletion through **relative path traversal**. The `run_hash` parameter, which is user-controllable, is concatenated without normalization as part of a path used to specify file deletion. This vulnerability is exposed through the `Repo._close_run()` method, which is accessible via the tracking server instruction API. As a result, an attacker can exploit this to delete any arbitrary file on the machine running the tracking server.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** LockManager.release_locks function
- **weakness:** **relative path traversal**
- **product:** aimhubio/aim
- **impact:** ['arbitrary file deletion', 'delete any arbitrary file']
