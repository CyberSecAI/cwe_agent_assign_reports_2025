CWE-23 is a parent of CWE-24 and both are related to path traversal. The relationships show a path traversal weakness that can lead to file inclusion. The abstraction levels influenced the selection by prioritizing the most specific CWE (Variant) for the primary weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe98[\"CWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe24[\"CWE-24: Path Traversal: '../filedir'\"]\n    \n    cwe24 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe98 primary\n    class cwe22 secondary\n    class cwe24 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper control of filename**, which can lead to both **Local File Inclusion** and **Remote File Inclusion** due to missing restrictions in the 'include/require' statement. A secondary weakness of **Relative Path Traversal** (CWE-23) can be present. The final impact is the **PHP local file inclusion**.\n  - Root Cause: Improper Control of Filename (CWE-98)\n  - Weakness: Local File Inclusion or Remote File Inclusion\n  - Impact: PHP Local File Inclusion\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence which highlights the **improper control of filename for include/require statement** as the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description states that the \"SB Random Posts Widget allows PHP **Local File Inclusion**.\" The keyphrase analysis further reinforces this by identifying CWE-98 as the top candidate for both the root cause and the resulting weakness.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by clarifying the relationship between CWE-22 and CWE-24, indicating that path traversal is a possible contributor to the file inclusion vulnerability.\n\nCWE-98 is selected as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability which is the **improper control of filename** in the `include/require` statement. It is at the optimal level of specificity (Variant) for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
