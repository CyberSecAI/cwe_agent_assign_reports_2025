# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-10097

## Vulnerability Description
The Loginizer Security and Loginizer plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.2. This is due to **insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the email and the user does not have an already-existing account for the service returning the token.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token**
- **impact:** log in as any existing user on the site
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **product:** Loginizer Security and Loginizer plugins for WordPress
- **version:** all versions up to and including 1.9.2

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient verification of the user information returned by the social login token. Specifically, the plugin does not verify if the email address associated with a social login is verified by the provider.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability for an attacker to bypass the normal authentication process.
*   **Insufficient Verification:** The lack of verification of email verification status from the social login provider allows attackers to potentially log in as existing users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An unauthenticated attacker can gain access to any existing user account on the WordPress site, including administrator accounts.
*   **Full Site Control:** If an attacker gains access to an administrator account, they can take full control of the website, potentially leading to data breaches, malware injection, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Social Login:** The attack vector is through the social login functionality of the Loginizer plugin.
*   **Email Address:** The attacker needs access to the email address of the target user.
*   **Unverified Email:** The attack is possible if the user does not have an already existing account for the service returning the token and the email is not verified on the social login platform

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to have an account on the target WordPress site.
*   **Access to Email:** The attacker needs to know the email address of the user they intend to impersonate.
*   **Social Login Provider:** The attacker needs to be able to authenticate through one of the configured social login providers.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the "Loginizer Security" and "Loginizer" plugins up to and including version 1.9.2.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.9.3 by adding a check to ensure the email address from the social provider is verified
*   The vulnerability was reported by wesley (wcraft) from Wordfence.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| No identity check (no login)                               | CWE-306        |
| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
