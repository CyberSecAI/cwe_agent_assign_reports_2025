  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved media intel/ipu6 **do not handle interrupts when device is disabled** Some IPU6 devices have shared interrupts. We need to handle properly case when interrupt is triggered from other device on shared irq line and IPU6 itself disabled. In such case we get 0xffffffff from ISR_STATUS register and handle all irqs cases, for what we are not not prepared and usually hang the whole system. To avoid the issue use pm_runtime_get_if_active() to check if the device is enabled and prevent suspending it when we handle irq until the end of irq. Additionally use synchronize_irq() in suspend",

  "reference_content": "The provided content relates to a vulnerability in the Intel IPU6 driver in the Linux kernel.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability occurs due to improper handling of shared interrupts when the IPU6 device is disabled. When an interrupt is triggered by another device sharing the same IRQ line while the IPU6 device is disabled, the driver reads an invalid value (0xffffffff) from the ISR_STATUS register. This leads the driver to attempt to handle all possible interrupt cases, for which it is not prepared, causing the system to hang.\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**\n- Improper interrupt handling: The driver does not check if the device is enabled before handling interrupts.\n- Race condition: The driver attempts to suspend the device while handling an interrupt.\n\n**Impact:**\n- System hang: The primary impact is a system hang due to the driver attempting to handle unexpected interrupt conditions.\n- Denial of service: The system becomes unusable, leading to a denial-of-service condition.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Triggering a shared interrupt while the IPU6 device is disabled. This can be achieved through actions that cause other devices on the shared IRQ line to generate interrupts.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker must be able to trigger interrupts on the shared IRQ line of the IPU6 device, while the device is disabled.\n- The attacker must have the ability to interact with devices on the same shared IRQ line.",

This can escalate to a system hang, representing a denial-of-service. The root cause is the **failure to properly manage access to shared resources**, potentially involving **improper locking mechanisms** or **lack of synchronization**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **failure to handle interrupts correctly when the device is disabled**. The primary evidence supporting this is the phrase \"**do not handle interrupts when device is disabled**\" from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section, as well as the description in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section. This led to the consideration of CWEs related to resource management, concurrency, and locking.\n\nThe Retriever results suggested CWE-833 (Deadlock), CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition), and CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')). However, the root cause appears to be the improper locking or synchronization that allows these conditions to arise.\n\nThe final decision was to assign CWE-667 (Improper Locking) as the primary CWE, since the device **does not handle interrupts when disabled**, which implies a locking issue if the device is trying to access shared resources when it should not.\nCWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) and CWE-833 (Deadlock) are secondary candidates because they are potential consequences of the **improper locking**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they address the underlying causes of the vulnerability rather than just the symptoms. CWE-667, as a Class, provides a broad categorization of the weakness, while CWE-362 and CWE-833 describe more specific scenarios that could arise from the improper locking.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Explanation**: The vulnerability involves the **failure to handle interrupts when the device is disabled**, indicating a potential locking issue, making this a relevant consideration.\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Explanation**: If the IPU6 device doesn't properly handle interrupts when disabled and shares interrupts, a race condition can occur.\n\n## CWE-833: Deadlock\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Explanation**: A deadlock could occur if multiple devices sharing the same IRQ line are waiting for each other, and the IPU6 device is disabled without proper interrupt handling.",
