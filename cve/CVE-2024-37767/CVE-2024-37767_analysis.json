  "description": "**Insecure permissions** in the component /api/admin/user of 14Finger v1.1 allows attackers to access all user information via a crafted GET request.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities reported in the GitHub issue:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe core issue across all reported vulnerabilities is the lack of strict verification of user identity and permissions before allowing operations. The application, \"14Finger,\" does not adequately check if the current user has the authority to perform the requested action.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\nThe following vulnerabilities were identified:\n\n1.  **14Finger User Sensitive Information Leakage Vulnerability**: The application leaks sensitive user information.\n2.  **14Finger User Privilege Escalation Vulnerability**: Users are able to gain higher privileges than they should possess.\n3.  **14Finger Arbitrary User Deletion Vulnerability**:  Users can delete other users' accounts, which they should not be able to do.\n4.  **14Finger Arbitrary User Password Reset Vulnerability**: Users can reset other users' passwords.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Information Leakage**: Sensitive user data can be exposed.\n*   **Privilege Escalation**: Unauthorized users can gain administrative or higher-level access.\n*   **Arbitrary User Deletion**:  Malicious users can delete accounts, causing data loss and disruption.\n*   **Arbitrary Password Reset**: Unauthorized users can lock out legitimate users by changing their passwords.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\nThe attack vector is through the application's interface or API, where a user can manipulate requests to perform unauthorized operations due to a lack of proper permission checks. The specific attack vectors would depend on the implementation of the application's user management functionality.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\nAn attacker would need to have a valid account within the \"14Finger\" application. The vulnerability can be exploited by a normal authenticated user if the application does not have the proper authorization mechanism in place.\n\nThe content provides more detail than the official CVE description, as it outlines four specific user management related vulnerabilities and provides a general root cause and possible fix.",

While more specific child CWEs might exist, the provided evidence does not offer enough granularity to pinpoint the precise authorization flaw. Instead, the high-level classification of CWE-285 adequately captures the general failure to perform correct authorization checks. Also the relationship that CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a child of CWE-200 (Information Exposure) was considered here.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n\n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe359 secondary\n    class cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **insecure permissions**, leading to **improper authorization**, which then results in the **exposure of private personal information**.\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Insecure Permissions**\n2.  **Weakness:** **Improper Authorization** (CWE-285)\n3.  **Impact:** **Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor** (CWE-359)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability and its resulting impact. The key phrase \"**insecure permissions**\" from the vulnerability description, along with the CVE Reference Links Content Summary indicating a \"lack of strict verification of user identity and permissions,\" strongly suggests an authorization issue.\n\nThe Retriever Results listed several candidate CWEs, including CWE-425, CWE-732, CWE-639, CWE-285, and CWE-668. While CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) initially seemed relevant, the description focuses more on *assignment* of permissions, whereas the vulnerability here appears to be about *checking* permissions. The retriever lists CWE-359 with a high score. The description of the vulnerability indicates that user information is exposed via crafted GET request.\n\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization) was selected as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the failure to perform or the incorrect performance of authorization checks. Although it is a Class-level CWE and thus discouraged, the available evidence doesn't sufficiently specify the exact nature of the authorization flaw to select a more specific Base-level CWE. The MITRE mapping guidance lists that the authorization logic is present but flawed.\n\nCWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was selected as a secondary CWE to highlight the specific impact of the authorization failure. This CWE is at the Base level of abstraction and accurately describes the resulting exposure of user information.\n\nThe selection of CWE-285 and CWE-359 is based on the available evidence, relationship analysis, and mapping guidance. While more specific CWEs might be applicable with additional information, the current classification provides a reasonable representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n**CWE-285: Improper Authorization**\n\n*   **Technical Explanation:** The application fails to adequately verify whether a user has the necessary permissions to access a resource or perform an action. This can occur due to flawed logic, missing checks, or incorrect implementation of authorization mechanisms.\n*   **Security Implications:** Unauthorized users can gain access to sensitive data, modify critical system settings, or perform actions they are not permitted to, leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, and other security incidents.\n*   **Relationship Analysis:** This is a Class-level CWE, and more specific Base or Variant CWEs might be applicable if more details about the authorization flaw were known.\n*   **Mapping Guidance Influence:** The MITRE mapping guidance influenced the decision to select this CWE, as it directly addresses the authorization aspect of the vulnerability, even though it is a Class-level CWE.\n*   **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor**\n\n*   **Technical Explanation:** The application unintentionally reveals private personal information to an actor who is not authorized to access it. This can occur through various means, such as unprotected API endpoints, insecure data storage, or flawed access controls.\n*   **Security Implications:** Exposure of private personal information can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, reputational damage, and other serious consequences for affected users.\n*   **Relationship Analysis:** This is a Base-level CWE, providing a specific classification for the information exposure impact. It is a child of CWE-200 (Information Exposure).\n*   **Mapping Guidance Influence:** The MITRE mapping guidance supports the selection of this CWE, as it directly describes the impact of the authorization failure.\n*   **Confidence:** 0.7\n\n**CWEs Considered but Not Used:**\n\n*   **CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource):** This CWE was considered but not selected because the vulnerability appears to be about incorrect *checking* of permissions rather than incorrect *assignment* of permissions.\n*   **CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key):** This CWE was considered, but the description does not explicitly state that the authorization bypass is happening through a user-controlled key.\n*   **CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere):** This CWE is discouraged because it is high-level and other CWEs are more specific.\n*   **CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function):** This was not selected as the CVE description states that attackers craft a GET request.",
