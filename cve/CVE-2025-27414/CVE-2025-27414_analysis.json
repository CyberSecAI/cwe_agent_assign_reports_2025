  "description": "MinIO is a high performance object storage. Starting in RELEASE.2024-06-06T09-36-42Z and prior to RELEASE.2025-02-28T09-55-16Z, a **bug in evaluating the trust of the SSH key used in an SFTP connection to MinIO** allows authentication bypass and unauthorized data access. On a MinIO server with SFTP access configured and using LDAP as an external identity provider, MinIO supports SSH key based authentication for SFTP connections when the user has the `sshPublicKey` attribute set in their LDAP server. The server trusts the clients key only when the public key is the same as the `sshPublicKey` attribute. Due to the bug, when the user has no `sshPublicKey` property in LDAP, the server ends up trusting the key allowing the client to perform any FTP operations allowed by the MinIO access policies associated with the LDAP user (or any of their groups). Three requirements must be met in order to exploit the vulnerability. First, the MinIO server must be configured to allow SFTP access and use LDAP as an external identity provider. Second, the attacker must have knowledge of an LDAP username that does not have the `sshPublicKey` property set. Third, such an LDAP username or one of their groups must also have some MinIO access policy configured. When this bug is successfully exploited, the attacker can perform any FTP operations (i.e. reading, writing, deleting and listing objects) allowed by the access policy associated with the LDAP user account (and their groups). Version 1.2.0 fixes the issue.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-27414 based on provided content:\n\nThe provided content details a security vulnerability (CVE-2025-27414) in MinIO Server related to SFTP authentication bypass. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:\n\n**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability occurs because, when a user authenticating via SSH key doesn't have an `sshPublicKey` attribute set in their LDAP entry, the server incorrectly trusts the provided key, allowing unauthorized access.\n\n**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Improper trust validation of SSH keys.\n*   Lack of proper attribute checking in LDAP authentication.\n\n**3. Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAn attacker can perform any FTP operations (reading, writing, deleting, listing objects) allowed by the MinIO access policies associated with the LDAP user account (or their groups).\n\n**4. Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Requires a MinIO server configured for SFTP access and using LDAP for external identity.\n*   Requires knowledge of an LDAP username *without* the `sshPublicKey` attribute.\n*   The LDAP user or one of their groups must have associated MinIO access policies.\n\n**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Knowledge of a valid LDAP username lacking the `sshPublicKey` attribute.\n*   Ability to provide a valid SSH key.\n\n**6. Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe vulnerability was patched in RELEASE.2025-02-28T09-55-16Z. The commit 4c71f1b and 91e1487 address the issue by enforcing the requirement of the `sshPublicKey` attribute in LDAP for key-based authentication. The code changes in `sftp-server.go` and `sftp-server_test.go` demonstrate the validation logic.\n\n**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The vulnerability was introduced in commit [91e1487](https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/91e1487de45720753c9e9e4c02b1bd16b7e452fa).\n*   The commit 4c71f1b fixes the issue.\n*   The vulnerability affects versions RELEASE.2024-06-06T09-36-42Z and newer.\n*   Credits are given to donatello (remediation developer) and ston1th (finder).\n*   The code changes show the addition of a check to ensure the `sshPublicKey` attribute exists in LDAP before trusting the key.\n*   The test case `SFTPPublicKeyAuthNoPubKey` confirms the fix.",

The vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary both highlight the **bug in evaluating the trust of the SSH key** when the `sshPublicKey` attribute is absent in LDAP. This leads to a complete bypass of authentication for SFTP access.\n\nThe decision to assign CWE-306 as the primary CWE is based on the explicit statement that the server trusts the client's key even when the user lacks the `sshPublicKey` property in LDAP, effectively bypassing authentication. The `Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance` helped choose between Authentication (CWE-306) and Authorization (CWE-863, CWE-285). Because no login happened, this implied Authentication and CWE-306.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was considered as a secondary CWE because after authentication is bypassed, the attacker can perform operations allowed by the MinIO access policies, which could be viewed as an authorization issue. However, the primary problem is the lack of authentication.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-306 directly addresses the missing authentication, and CWE-863 highlights the consequences related to MinIO access policies.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
