# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-27414

## Description

MinIO is a high performance object storage. Starting in RELEASE.2024-06-06T09-36-42Z and prior to RELEASE.2025-02-28T09-55-16Z, a **bug in evaluating the trust of the SSH key used in an SFTP connection to MinIO** allows authentication bypass and unauthorized data access. On a MinIO server with SFTP access configured and using LDAP as an external identity provider, MinIO supports SSH key based authentication for SFTP connections when the user has the `sshPublicKey` attribute set in their LDAP server. The server trusts the clients key only when the public key is the same as the `sshPublicKey` attribute. Due to the bug, when the user has no `sshPublicKey` property in LDAP, the server ends up trusting the key allowing the client to perform any FTP operations allowed by the MinIO access policies associated with the LDAP user (or any of their groups). Three requirements must be met in order to exploit the vulnerability. First, the MinIO server must be configured to allow SFTP access and use LDAP as an external identity provider. Second, the attacker must have knowledge of an LDAP username that does not have the `sshPublicKey` property set. Third, such an LDAP username or one of their groups must also have some MinIO access policy configured. When this bug is successfully exploited, the attacker can perform any FTP operations (i.e. reading, writing, deleting and listing objects) allowed by the access policy associated with the LDAP user account (and their groups). Version 1.2.0 fixes the issue.

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the parent-child relationship between CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) and CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). While CWE-287 is a broader class, CWE-306 provides a more specific description of the vulnerability: the complete absence of authentication for a critical function (SFTP access).

The `Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance` was very influential in choosing the right CWE, emphasizing that *“If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.”*

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **bug in evaluating the trust of the SSH key**, leading to **missing authentication** and ultimately resulting in **unauthorized data access**.

1.  **Root Cause:** **Bug in evaluating the trust of the SSH key** (Implicitly CWE related to incorrect trust/validation)
2.  **Weakness:** CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function. No authentication is performed when the `sshPublicKey` attribute is missing in the LDAP entry.
3.  **Impact:** Unauthorized data access.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting impact. The vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary both highlight the **bug in evaluating the trust of the SSH key** when the `sshPublicKey` attribute is absent in LDAP. This leads to a complete bypass of authentication for SFTP access.

The decision to assign CWE-306 as the primary CWE is based on the explicit statement that the server trusts the client's key even when the user lacks the `sshPublicKey` property in LDAP, effectively bypassing authentication. The `Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance` helped choose between Authentication (CWE-306) and Authorization (CWE-863, CWE-285). Because no login happened, this implied Authentication and CWE-306.

CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was considered as a secondary CWE because after authentication is bypassed, the attacker can perform operations allowed by the MinIO access policies, which could be viewed as an authorization issue. However, the primary problem is the lack of authentication.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-306 directly addresses the missing authentication, and CWE-863 highlights the consequences related to MinIO access policies.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
