# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-27414

## Vulnerability Description
MinIO is a high performance object storage. Starting in RELEASE.2024-06-06T09-36-42Z and prior to RELEASE.2025-02-28T09-55-16Z, a **bug in evaluating the trust of the SSH key used in an SFTP connection to MinIO** allows authentication bypass and unauthorized data access. On a MinIO server with SFTP access configured and using LDAP as an external identity provider, MinIO supports SSH key based authentication for SFTP connections when the user has the `sshPublicKey` attribute set in their LDAP server. The server trusts the clients key only when the public key is the same as the `sshPublicKey` attribute. Due to the bug, when the user has no `sshPublicKey` property in LDAP, the server ends up trusting the key allowing the client to perform any FTP operations allowed by the MinIO access policies associated with the LDAP user (or any of their groups). Three requirements must be met in order to exploit the vulnerability. First, the MinIO server must be configured to allow SFTP access and use LDAP as an external identity provider. Second, the attacker must have knowledge of an LDAP username that does not have the `sshPublicKey` property set. Third, such an LDAP username or one of their groups must also have some MinIO access policy configured. When this bug is successfully exploited, the attacker can perform any FTP operations (i.e. reading, writing, deleting and listing objects) allowed by the access policy associated with the LDAP user account (and their groups). Version 1.2.0 fixes the issue.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-27414 based on provided content:

The provided content details a security vulnerability (CVE-2025-27414) in MinIO Server related to SFTP authentication bypass. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:

**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability occurs because, when a user authenticating via SSH key doesn't have an `sshPublicKey` attribute set in their LDAP entry, the server incorrectly trusts the provided key, allowing unauthorized access.

**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Improper trust validation of SSH keys.
*   Lack of proper attribute checking in LDAP authentication.

**3. Impact of exploitation:**

An attacker can perform any FTP operations (reading, writing, deleting, listing objects) allowed by the MinIO access policies associated with the LDAP user account (or their groups).

**4. Attack vectors:**

*   Requires a MinIO server configured for SFTP access and using LDAP for external identity.
*   Requires knowledge of an LDAP username *without* the `sshPublicKey` attribute.
*   The LDAP user or one of their groups must have associated MinIO access policies.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Knowledge of a valid LDAP username lacking the `sshPublicKey` attribute.
*   Ability to provide a valid SSH key.

**6. Mitigation or fix:**

The vulnerability was patched in RELEASE.2025-02-28T09-55-16Z. The commit 4c71f1b and 91e1487 address the issue by enforcing the requirement of the `sshPublicKey` attribute in LDAP for key-based authentication. The code changes in `sftp-server.go` and `sftp-server_test.go` demonstrate the validation logic.

**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in commit [91e1487](https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/91e1487de45720753c9e9e4c02b1bd16b7e452fa).
*   The commit 4c71f1b fixes the issue.
*   The vulnerability affects versions RELEASE.2024-06-06T09-36-42Z and newer.
*   Credits are given to donatello (remediation developer) and ston1th (finder).
*   The code changes show the addition of a check to ensure the `sshPublicKey` attribute exists in LDAP before trusting the key.
*   The test case `SFTPPublicKeyAuthNoPubKey` confirms the fix.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
