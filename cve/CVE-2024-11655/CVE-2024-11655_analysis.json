  "description": "A vulnerability classified as critical was found in EnGenius ENH1350EXT, ENS500-AC and ENS620EXT up to 20241118. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file /admin/network/diag_pinginterface. The manipulation of the argument diag_ping leads to **command injection**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from unfiltered user input being passed directly to a system command in the `diag_ping` functionality of the ENGENIUS router's web interface. Specifically, the value provided by the user for the `diag_ping` parameter is directly used as part of a command executed by the system.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability exists due to the lack of input sanitization or filtering.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system, potentially gaining complete control of the device. This includes access to system permissions.\n- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the ENGENIUS router, specifically the `/admin/network/diag_ping` endpoint. The attacker crafts a malicious request that includes shell commands within the `diag_ping` parameter.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have access to the router's web interface and be logged in with sufficient privileges to access the diagnostic ping functionality.",

The **command injection** vulnerability occurs because the application **improperly neutralizes** special elements, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship impacting the decision is the hierarchical relationship between CWE-77 (Class) and CWE-78 (Base). Since the vulnerability specifically involves OS commands, the more specific CWE-78 is chosen over CWE-77. No other relationships significantly influenced the decision.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of input, leading to the execution of arbitrary OS commands.\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n2.  **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution, potentially leading to complete control of the device.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly supports the selection of CWE-78 as the primary CWE for this vulnerability. The vulnerability description and CVE reference links clearly indicate that the root cause is **improper neutralization** of special elements in the `diag_ping` argument, leading to **command injection**. The retriever results also identify CWE-78 as a strong candidate. The final selection is based on the specific evidence provided, the hierarchical relationship between CWE-77 and CWE-78, and the MITRE mapping guidance. CWE-78 is the most specific and accurate representation of the **weakness**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
