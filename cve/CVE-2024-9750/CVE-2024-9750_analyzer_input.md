# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-9750

## Vulnerability Description
Tungsten Automation Power PDF PNG File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Tungsten Automation Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PNG files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24466.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9750:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of PNG files within Tungsten Automation Power PDF. This insufficient validation leads to a read operation that extends past the boundaries of an allocated memory object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to insufficient input validation when parsing PNG files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running Power PDF. This means the attacker could potentially gain full control over the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by a remote attacker.
- The attack requires user interaction. Specifically, the user must either:
    - Visit a malicious web page containing a crafted PNG file.
    - Open a malicious PDF file that includes a crafted PNG file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to deliver a malicious PNG file, either through a website or a malicious PDF document.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication or special privileges on the user's system to initiate the attack.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 5.1 of Tungsten Automation Power PDF.
