  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Codezips Hospital Management System 1.0 and classified as critical. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /invo.php. The manipulation of the argument dname leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Other parameters might be affected as well.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content is related to CVE-2024-12947.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input sanitization of the `dname` parameter in the `/invo.php` file. User-supplied input is directly used in SQL queries without proper validation or cleaning.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- SQL Injection vulnerability in `/invo.php`\n- Insufficient user input validation for `dname` parameter\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Unauthorized database access\n- Sensitive data leakage\n- Data tampering\n- Comprehensive system control\n- Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- HTTP POST request to `/invo.php`\n- Exploitation of the `dname` parameter\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- No login or authentication required\n- Ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint\n- Ability to inject malicious SQL code into the `dname` parameter\n- Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n- The vulnerability is a boolean-based blind SQL injection.\n- The attacker can use time-based blind techniques (e.g., `SLEEP()`) to infer information.\n- The provided PoC uses `sqlmap` to demonstrate exploitation.\n- The attacker can retrieve databases information.\n- The provided payload `pname=111&dname=111' AND (SELECT 2655 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))mwzM) AND 'jeJf'='jeJf&age=111&mc=11&dc=111&submit=SUBMIT` can be used for exploitation.\n- Screenshots from SQLMap show successful exploitation.\n- The suggested fixes are using prepared statements, input validation, minimal database user permissions and regular security audits.",

The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization of the `dname` parameter which leads to SQL Injection. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship considered was the direct match of the vulnerability description to the definition and examples of CWE-89. There are no parent-child or chain relationships that directly influenced the selection in this case, as the evidence strongly supports a direct mapping. The abstraction level of Base is appropriate as it directly represents the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of the `dname` parameter, leading directly to **SQL Injection**. The impact includes unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, and potential system compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe assessment is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary, which clearly indicates an **SQL Injection** vulnerability due to the lack of input sanitization. The retriever results also strongly support this classification, with CWE-89 having the highest score.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability. The evidence clearly shows that the **improper neutralization** of the `dname` parameter leads to the injection of SQL commands, allowing attackers to manipulate the database.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
