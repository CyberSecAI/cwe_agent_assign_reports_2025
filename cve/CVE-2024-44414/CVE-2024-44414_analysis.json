  "description": "A vulnerability was discovered in FBM_292W-21.03.10V, which has been classified as critical. This issue affects the sub_4901E0 function in the msp_info.htm file. Manipulation of the path parameter can lead to **command injection**.",

    "component": "sub_4901E0 function in msp_info.htm"
  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe root cause is improper handling of user-supplied input within the `sub_4901E0` function, specifically within the `msp_info.htm` file. The `httpd_get_parm` function retrieves a parameter which is later used in a `sprintf` function. This concatenated string is then executed by the `system` function without proper sanitization.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. An attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands via the `cmd` parameter due to the lack of input sanitization.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the device. This could lead to a variety of malicious outcomes, including:\n  - **Data exfiltration**\n  - **Device takeover**\n  - **Malware installation**\n  - **Denial of service**\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **HTTP Request Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/msp_info.htm` endpoint, specifically by manipulating the value of the `flag` parameter to `cmd`, and supplying shell commands via the `cmd` parameter.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device's web interface.\n- **Understanding of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`/msp_info.htm`) and the required parameters (`flag=cmd` and `cmd`).\n- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:**  The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the device.\n- **Authentication:** While the provided PoC includes cookies, the text implies that the vulnerability can be triggered by providing the required parameters, which suggests that the vulnerability is present both with and without authentication. This would need further verification.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- The vulnerability lies in the `sub_4901E0` function of the firmware.\n- The `httpd_get_parm` function retrieves the value of a parameter which is later concatenated into a string that will be passed to `system`.\n- The value `cmd` is used to enable the vulnerable code path.\n- The `sprintf` function concatenates user supplied data with another value, which is then executed by the `system` command.\n\n**Firmware Version:**\n- WAYOS:FBM_292W-21.03.10V\n\n**Additional Details**\n- The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability by sending a GET request with a malicious `cmd` parameter, which is then executed by the system. The PoC specifically shows how to use the parameter to write the results of `ps` to `a.txt`.\n\nThis analysis provides more detailed information than the official CVE description.",

CWE-78 is a child of CWE-74, representing a more specific type of injection. The vulnerability description clearly indicates **OS Command Injection**, making CWE-78 the more appropriate choice. While CWE-74 is a broader category that encompasses injection vulnerabilities, the evidence strongly suggests a command injection context.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of user-supplied input** within the `sub_4901E0` function. This leads to the construction of a command string using `sprintf` with unsanitized input, which is then executed by the `system` function. The chain can be summarized as:\n\n1.  **Improper Input Handling**: The application fails to sanitize the input received via the `cmd` parameter.\n2.  **Command Injection (CWE-78)**: Due to the lack of sanitization, an attacker can inject arbitrary OS commands.\n3.  **Arbitrary Command Execution**: The injected commands are executed on the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly supports the classification of this vulnerability as CWE-78, **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')**. The vulnerability description clearly states that manipulation of the path parameter leads to **command injection**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, highlighting that the root cause is improper handling of user-supplied input within the `sub_4901E0` function. The `httpd_get_parm` function retrieves a parameter which is later used in a `sprintf` function. This concatenated string is then executed by the `system` function without proper sanitization. This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-78.\n\nThe Retriever Results also supports this conclusion with CWE-78 having a high similarity score and being a Base level CWE.\n\nCWE-74 was considered but not chosen as the primary CWE because it is a more general class of injection vulnerabilities. While the vulnerability involves injection, the specific type of injection is OS command injection, making CWE-78 a more precise and appropriate classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 1326.25\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
