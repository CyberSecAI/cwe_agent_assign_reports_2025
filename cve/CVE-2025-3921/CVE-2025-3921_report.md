# Analysis Report for CVE-2025-3921

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-3921

## Description

The PeproDev Ultimate Profile Solutions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a **missing capability check** on the handel_ajax_req() function in versions 1.9.1 to 7.5.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary users metadata which can be leveraged to block an administrator from accessing their site when wp_capabilities is set to 0.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** missing capability check
- **Impact:** unauthorized modification of data
- **Attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **Product:** PeproDev Ultimate Profile Solutions plugin for WordPress
- **Version:** versions 1.9.1 to 7.5.2
- **Component:** handel_ajax_req() function

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 1.0 | Class | Primary CWE | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-471 | Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID) | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis

The primary CWE is CWE-862 **Missing Authorization**, which is a Class-level CWE. CWE-425 **Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')** and CWE-288 are children of CWE-862. CWE-471 **Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)** can be a consequence of CWE-425. The abstraction levels influenced the selection, favoring the more general Class level for the primary cause due to lack of specific detail, but including the Base level CWE-471 as a secondary weakness due to the impact described.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing capability check** (CWE-862 **Missing Authorization**), which leads to unauthorized access (CWE-425 **Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')**), and ultimately results in the modification of user metadata (CWE-471 **Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)**).

## Summary of Analysis

The analysis indicates a clear **missing capability check** in the `handel_ajax_req()` function, allowing unauthenticated attackers to modify user metadata. The primary weakness is CWE-862 **Missing Authorization**, as it directly addresses the root cause. The secondary weakness, CWE-471 **Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)**, describes the consequence of the missing authorization.

The vulnerability description clearly states a **missing capability check** as the root cause, supporting the selection of CWE-862. The description also mentions the modification of user metadata, aligning with CWE-471.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-862 representing the general authorization issue and CWE-471 detailing the specific impact of modifying user metadata.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-862: Missing Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-178: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly account for differences in case sensitivity when accessing or determining the properties of a resource, leading to inconsistent results.
