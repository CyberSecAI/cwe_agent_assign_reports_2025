  "description": "The PeproDev Ultimate Profile Solutions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a **missing capability check** on the handel_ajax_req() function in versions 1.9.1 to 7.5.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary users metadata which can be leveraged to block an administrator from accessing their site when wp_capabilities is set to 0.",

CWE-425 **Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')** and CWE-288 are children of CWE-862. CWE-471 **Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)** can be a consequence of CWE-425.
