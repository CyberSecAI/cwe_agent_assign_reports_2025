This can then lead to **CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')** if the attacker can control the response from the SSRF target and the application improperly processes it as code. The relationship is that the SSRF allows the attacker to inject code, so CWE-918 can precede CWE-94. CWE-94 is a child of CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe913[\"CWE-913: Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources\"]\n\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe913\n    cwe918 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe94\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n\n    class cwe918 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n    class cwe913 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**, allowing an attacker to make internal requests. If the attacker can control the response from these requests and the application **Improperly Controls the Generation of Code ('Code Injection')**, they can execute arbitrary code.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**, as the vulnerability description explicitly states \"**code injection via internal SSRF requests**\". The description details that this allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Python code. This suggests that the attacker can control the response from the SSRF target. The application then processes this response as code in an unsafe manner, leading to **CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')**.\n\nThe evidence for CWE-918 comes directly from the \"**weakness:** **code injection via internal SSRF requests**\" phrase in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section.\n\nCWE-94 is also supported by the evidence as the vulnerability results in the \"impact:** execute arbitrary Python code\".\n\nI considered other CWEs from the retriever results, such as CWE-20, CWE-78, and CWE-611, but these were not as directly relevant as CWE-918 and CWE-94. CWE-20 is a more general case of improper input validation and doesn't capture the specific SSRF aspect. CWE-78 is OS Command Injection, which is not as specific as the code injection described in the vulnerability. CWE-611 is related to XML external entities, which is not mentioned in the description.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
