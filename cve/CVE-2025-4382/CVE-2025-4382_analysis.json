  "description": "A flaw was found in systems utilizing LUKS-encrypted disks with GRUB configured for TPM-based auto-decryption. When GRUB is set to automatically decrypt disks using keys stored in the TPM, it reads the decryption key into system memory. If an attacker with physical access can corrupt the underlying filesystem superblock, GRUB will fail to locate a valid filesystem and enter rescue mode. At this point, the disk is already decrypted, and the decryption key remains loaded in system memory. This scenario may allow an attacker with physical access to access the unencrypted data without any further authentication, thereby compromising data confidentiality. Furthermore, the ability to force this state through filesystem corruption also presents a data integrity concern.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-4382 Content\n\nHere's an analysis of the provided content, focusing on information relevant to CVE-2025-4382, as described in the prompt's guidelines:\n\n**1. Verification:**\n\nThe content directly references \"CVE-2025-4382\" and provides a description aligning with a vulnerability in `grub2`. Therefore, the content is **RELATED** to the specified CVE.\n\n**2. Extracted Information:**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** When using encrypted LUKS devices unlocked through a TPM, if `grub` fails to find the underlying filesystem, it enters rescue mode, leaving the encryption key in memory.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** `grub2` allows access to encrypted devices through the CLI even after the root device is unlocked via TPM, when a filesystem isn't found. This exposes the encryption key in memory.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with physical access to the target machine can access encrypted data through the `grub` CLI, which should not be accessible in this scenario.\n*   **Attack vectors:** Physical access to the machine. Exploitation occurs via the `grub` command-line interface.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Physical access to the target machine and familiarity with the `grub` CLI.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** Not specified in this content.\n*   **Additional Details:** The bug report is filed under \"Security Response\" with a medium priority and severity. The bug was reported on 2025-05-06.\n\n**3. Content Details:**\n\nThe bug report provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description. It specifically outlines the scenario leading to the vulnerability (TPM unlocked LUKS, filesystem not found, rescue mode) and the resulting exposure of the encryption key.\n\n**Note:** The content is a bug report and does not contain a fix or mitigation. It only describes the vulnerability.",

While other CWEs like those related to authentication and authorization were considered due to the access control implications, CWE-312 directly addresses the **root cause** of storing sensitive information (the decryption key) in cleartext. The Base abstraction level is appropriate as it directly describes the flaw.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe523[\"CWE-523: Unprotected Transport of Credentials\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n\n    cwe523 -->|CHILDOF| cwe312\n    cwe201 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe312\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe523,cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain begins with filesystem corruption, which leads to GRUB entering rescue mode. Because GRUB had already decrypted the disk with the TPM key, the decryption key remains in system memory, essentially **stored in cleartext** (CWE-312). The attacker can then potentially access this key and use it to compromise the data.\n\n*   Filesystem Corruption -> GRUB Rescue Mode -> **Cleartext Storage of Decryption Key** (CWE-312) -> Data Confidentiality Breach\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which provide clear evidence of the decryption key remaining in memory after the filesystem corruption.\n\nThe most pertinent evidence is: \"At this point, the disk is already decrypted, and the decryption key remains loaded in system memory.\"\n\nThis directly implies that the key is accessible in cleartext.\n\nWhile other CWEs were considered, especially those related to authentication/authorization bypass, the **root cause** lies in the fact that the key is present in memory in an unencrypted form. Therefore, CWE-312 is the most accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability. The abstraction level of \"Base\" for CWE-312 is appropriate as it directly describes the flaw.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
