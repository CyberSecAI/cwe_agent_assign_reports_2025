## Vulnerability Description
TONE store App version 3.4.2 and earlier contains an issue with **unprotected primary channel**. Since TONE store App communicates with TONE store website in cleartext, a man-in-the-middle attack may allow an attacker to obtain and/or alter communications of the affected App.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **unprotected primary channel**
- **impact:** obtain and/or alter communications
- **vector:** man-in-the-middle attack
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** TONE store App
- **version:** 3.4.2 and earlier

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The TONE store App transmits data to the TONE store website in cleartext.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Transmission:** The app does not encrypt communications with the TONE store website, which means data is sent without protection. This is classified as CWE-419 (Unprotected Transport of Credentials).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** An attacker positioned in the network path can intercept the unencrypted traffic.
- **Data Exposure:** The attacker can obtain the transmitted data.
- **Data Modification:** The attacker may be able to alter the data being transmitted, potentially leading to manipulation of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited via a network-based man-in-the-middle attack, especially on insecure networks (like public Wi-Fi).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Interception:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the TONE store app and the TONE store website. This could be done by setting up a malicious wireless access point or compromising a network device.
- **Passive or Active Interception:** The attacker can either passively eavesdrop on the traffic or actively manipulate it.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Product:** TONE store App version 3.4.2 and earlier, pre-installed on TONE smartphones.
- **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is fixed in the latest version of the TONE store app. Users are advised to update to the latest version.
- **CVSS Score:** 3.7 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N) indicating a network attack vector with high complexity, no privileges required, no user interaction needed, and a low impact on integrity.

This information is more detailed than the placeholder CVE description, providing clear information on the root cause, impact, and mitigations.
