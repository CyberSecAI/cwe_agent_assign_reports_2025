## Vulnerability Description
The LTL Freight Quotes Purolator Edition plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the dropship_edit_id and edit_id parameters in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.3 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**.
