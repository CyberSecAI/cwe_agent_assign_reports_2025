  "description": "A vulnerability has been found in zj1983 zz up to 2024-8 and classified as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is the function getOaWid of the file src/main/java/com/futvan/z/system/zworkflow/ZworkflowAction.java. The manipulation of the argument tableId leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

The vulnerability is due to **SQL Injection**. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-89. This is a base level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction. There are no parent or child relationships that are relevant in this case.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is simple:\n1.  Improper handling of the tableId argument allows for **SQL Injection**.\n2.  The **SQL Injection** allows for unauthorized data access or modification.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the vulnerability is due to **SQL Injection** via manipulation of the `tableId` argument.
