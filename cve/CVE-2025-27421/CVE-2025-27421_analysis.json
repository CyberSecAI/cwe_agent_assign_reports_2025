  "description": "Abacus is a highly scalable and stateless counting API. A **critical goroutine leak vulnerability** has been identified in the Abacus servers Server-Sent Events (SSE) implementation. The issue occurs when clients disconnect from the /stream endpoint, as the server fails to properly clean up resources and terminate associated goroutines. This leads to resource exhaustion where the server continues running but eventually stops accepting new SSE connections while maintaining high memory usage. The vulnerability specifically involves **improper channel cleanup** in the event handling mechanism, causing goroutines to remain blocked indefinitely. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.0.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-27421 based on provided content\n\nThe provided content **relates to** CVE-2025-27421. It details a goroutine leak vulnerability in the Abacus SSE implementation. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   Improper channel cleanup in the event handling mechanism when clients disconnect from the `/stream` endpoint. This causes goroutines to remain blocked indefinitely.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Goroutine leak\n*   Resource exhaustion (memory growth)\n*   CWE-400: Improper Resource Cleanup\n*   CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Permanent unresponsiveness of the `/stream` endpoint after prolonged use.\n*   Memory growth leading to high memory usage and preventing proper functionality.\n*   Selective denial of service affecting only SSE connections.\n*   Accumulation of orphaned goroutines that cannot be garbage collected.\n*   High resource consumption under sustained client connection/disconnection patterns.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Frequent establishment and termination of SSE connections by clients.\n*   High-traffic environments or connection stress testing exacerbate the issue.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   No specific privileges or user interaction are required. An attacker can simply establish and disconnect SSE connections.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Upgrade to v1.4.0 or later:** This version includes fixes for proper cleanup of client connections, buffered channels, mutex-protected cleanup logic, timeout protection, improved monitoring, and restructuring of the event broadcasting system.\n*   **Workarounds (if upgrading is not immediately possible):**\n    *   Limit maximum connections to the `/stream` endpoint via a reverse proxy.\n    *   Implement request timeouts for SSE connections.\n    *   Schedule regular restarts of the Abacus service.\n    *   Monitor memory usage for abnormal growth.\n    *   Run a dedicated Abacus instance for SSE connections.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The commit message (from the second content snippet) details the specific changes made to address the vulnerability.\n*   A proof-of-concept (POC) is available at [https://github.com/JasonLovesDoggo/abacus/blob/main/docs/bugs/GHSA-vh64-54px-qgf8/test.py](https://github.com/JasonLovesDoggo/abacus/blob/main/docs/bugs/GHSA-vh64-54px-qgf8/test.py).\n*   References to relevant documentation and resources are provided (Go Concurrency Patterns, CWE details, OWASP Top 10, Resource Management in Go).\n*   CVSS score and metrics are provided (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H, Score 7.5/10).\n*   Test results are available in `docs/bugs/GHSA-vh64-54px-qgf8/results.md` showing the impact of the vulnerability and the effectiveness of the fix.",

Describes the impact of the resource leak, but not the root cause. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-772, which represents the **missing release** of resources, specifically goroutines in this case. CWE-401, a more specific variant related to memory, was considered due to the memory usage impact but is less directly supported by evidence than CWE-772. CWE-400 describes the impact of the resource leak, which is uncontrolled resource consumption.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe772[\"CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n\n    cwe401 -->|CHILDOF| cwe772\n    cwe772 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    cwe400 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe772\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe772 primary\n    class cwe401,cwe400 secondary\n    class cwe404 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper channel cleanup** (the **root cause**), leading to goroutines remaining blocked indefinitely, resulting in a **missing release of resources**, and ultimately causing **resource exhaustion**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference links. The vulnerability involves a goroutine leak in the Abacus servers SSE implementation due to **improper channel cleanup**. This leads to resource exhaustion as goroutines are not properly terminated when clients disconnect.\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-772, which directly addresses the **missing release of resources** after their effective lifetime. The evidence supporting this selection comes from the vulnerability description, which states that the server \"fails to properly clean up resources and terminate associated goroutines\". The CVE reference links content summary also mentions \"CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime.\"\n\nCWE-401 was considered because the vulnerability leads to memory growth. However, CWE-772 is a better fit because the core issue is the failure to release the goroutines themselves, not just the memory they consume.\n\nCWE-400 was also considered because the ultimate impact is resource exhaustion. However, this CWE represents the impact rather than the **root cause**, making it less appropriate as the primary classification.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly describes the programming error that leads to the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product releases a resource such as memory or a file so that it can be made available for reuse, but it does not clear or \"zeroize\" the information contained in the resource before the product performs a critical state transition or makes the resource available for reuse by other entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
