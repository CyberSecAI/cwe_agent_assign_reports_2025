## Vulnerability Description
Abacus is a highly scalable and stateless counting API. A **critical goroutine leak vulnerability** has been identified in the Abacus servers Server-Sent Events (SSE) implementation. The issue occurs when clients disconnect from the /stream endpoint, as the server fails to properly clean up resources and terminate associated goroutines. This leads to resource exhaustion where the server continues running but eventually stops accepting new SSE connections while maintaining high memory usage. The vulnerability specifically involves **improper channel cleanup** in the event handling mechanism, causing goroutines to remain blocked indefinitely. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.0.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **vector:** clients disconnect from the /stream endpoint
- **weakness:** **critical goroutine leak vulnerability**
- **product:** Abacus servers
- **impact:** resource exhaustion, stops accepting new SSE connections, high memory usage

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-27421 based on provided content

The provided content **relates to** CVE-2025-27421. It details a goroutine leak vulnerability in the Abacus SSE implementation. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Improper channel cleanup in the event handling mechanism when clients disconnect from the `/stream` endpoint. This causes goroutines to remain blocked indefinitely.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Goroutine leak
*   Resource exhaustion (memory growth)
*   CWE-400: Improper Resource Cleanup
*   CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Permanent unresponsiveness of the `/stream` endpoint after prolonged use.
*   Memory growth leading to high memory usage and preventing proper functionality.
*   Selective denial of service affecting only SSE connections.
*   Accumulation of orphaned goroutines that cannot be garbage collected.
*   High resource consumption under sustained client connection/disconnection patterns.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Frequent establishment and termination of SSE connections by clients.
*   High-traffic environments or connection stress testing exacerbate the issue.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   No specific privileges or user interaction are required. An attacker can simply establish and disconnect SSE connections.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Upgrade to v1.4.0 or later:** This version includes fixes for proper cleanup of client connections, buffered channels, mutex-protected cleanup logic, timeout protection, improved monitoring, and restructuring of the event broadcasting system.
*   **Workarounds (if upgrading is not immediately possible):**
    *   Limit maximum connections to the `/stream` endpoint via a reverse proxy.
    *   Implement request timeouts for SSE connections.
    *   Schedule regular restarts of the Abacus service.
    *   Monitor memory usage for abnormal growth.
    *   Run a dedicated Abacus instance for SSE connections.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The commit message (from the second content snippet) details the specific changes made to address the vulnerability.
*   A proof-of-concept (POC) is available at [https://github.com/JasonLovesDoggo/abacus/blob/main/docs/bugs/GHSA-vh64-54px-qgf8/test.py](https://github.com/JasonLovesDoggo/abacus/blob/main/docs/bugs/GHSA-vh64-54px-qgf8/test.py).
*   References to relevant documentation and resources are provided (Go Concurrency Patterns, CWE details, OWASP Top 10, Resource Management in Go).
*   CVSS score and metrics are provided (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H, Score 7.5/10).
*   Test results are available in `docs/bugs/GHSA-vh64-54px-qgf8/results.md` showing the impact of the vulnerability and the effectiveness of the fix.
