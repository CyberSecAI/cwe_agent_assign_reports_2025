## Vulnerability Description
AutoGPT versions 0.3.4 and earlier are vulnerable to a **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)** that could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The vulnerability arises from the **improper handling of user-supplied format strings** in the `AgentOutputBlock` implementation, where malicious input is passed to the Jinja2 templating engine without adequate security measures. Attackers can exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary commands on the host system. The issue is fixed in version 0.4.0.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-1040 Content

The provided content relates to a fix for potential code injection vulnerabilities in AutoGPT. It details the implementation of a sandboxed Jinja2 environment for text formatting to improve security.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The original code used plain Jinja objects for text formatting within block codes, which could allow for arbitrary code execution if the format string was controlled by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Use of unsandboxed Jinja2 templates.
*   Potential for code injection through crafted format strings.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Attack vectors:**

An attacker could potentially inject malicious code through the `format` parameter in block codes, which would then be executed by the Jinja2 template engine.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

The attacker would need to be able to control the content of the `format` string within a block code.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The fix introduces a `TextFormatter` utility class that utilizes `jinja2.sandbox.SandboxedEnvironment` for safer text formatting. This environment restricts access to potentially dangerous functions and features, mitigating the risk of code injection. The code also clears registered filters, tests, and globals to further minimize the attack surface.
