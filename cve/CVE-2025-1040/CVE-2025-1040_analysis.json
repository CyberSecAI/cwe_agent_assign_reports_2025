  "description": "AutoGPT versions 0.3.4 and earlier are vulnerable to a **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)** that could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The vulnerability arises from the **improper handling of user-supplied format strings** in the `AgentOutputBlock` implementation, where malicious input is passed to the Jinja2 templating engine without adequate security measures. Attackers can exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary commands on the host system. The issue is fixed in version 0.4.0.",

It details the implementation of a sandboxed Jinja2 environment for text formatting to improve security.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe original code used plain Jinja objects for text formatting within block codes, which could allow for arbitrary code execution if the format string was controlled by an attacker.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Use of unsandboxed Jinja2 templates.\n*   Potential for code injection through crafted format strings.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nAn attacker could potentially inject malicious code through the `format` parameter in block codes, which would then be executed by the Jinja2 template engine.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\nThe attacker would need to be able to control the content of the `format` string within a block code.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe fix introduces a `TextFormatter` utility class that utilizes `jinja2.sandbox.SandboxedEnvironment` for safer text formatting. This environment restricts access to potentially dangerous functions and features, mitigating the risk of code injection. The code also clears registered filters, tests, and globals to further minimize the attack surface.",

The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the use of the Jinja2 templating engine and the **improper handling** of user-supplied format strings, aligning perfectly with CWE-1336. The fix involved implementing a sandboxed Jinja2 environment, further reinforcing the relevance of this CWE.\n\nCWE-95 is considered as a secondary CWE because the SSTI can lead to dynamic code evaluation, but the primary issue remains the template engine vulnerability.

The retriever scores also support the selection of CWE-1336 as a highly relevant CWE for this vulnerability.\n\nCWE-20 was considered, but it was determined to be too high-level.\nCWE-78, CWE-88, and CWE-89 were considered but found to be related to OS Command Injection and SQL Injection respectively, and were therefore not relevant.\nCWE-120 and CWE-787 were considered but found to be related to Buffer Overflow and Out-of-bounds Write respectively, and were therefore not relevant.",
