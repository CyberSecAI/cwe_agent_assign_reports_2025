CWE-89 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level.

Based on this evidence, CWE-89 is the most appropriate classification.

CWEs considered but not used:

*   CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')): While neutralization is a factor in many injection vulnerabilities, the specific injection target is an SQL command, not a web page. Therefore, CWE-79 is not applicable.
*   CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type): This CWE relates to file uploads, which is not relevant to the described **SQL injection** vulnerability.
*   CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine): This CWE relates to Template Engines, which is not relevant to the described **SQL injection** vulnerability.
*   CWE-96 (Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')): This CWE relates to static code injection, which is not relevant to the described **SQL injection** vulnerability.
