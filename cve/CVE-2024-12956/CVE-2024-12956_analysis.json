  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12956\n\n**Vulnerability:** Unrestricted File Upload\n\n**Root Cause:**\n* The `/add_achievement_details.php` file in the \"Portfolio Management System MCA Project using PHP and MySQL\" project allows arbitrary file uploads without proper restrictions.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application does not validate or sanitize the uploaded file's type, name, or content. This allows an attacker to upload any file, including executable scripts.\n*   **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any special permissions, meaning an attacker does not need to be logged in or have any specific role within the application.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can upload and execute malicious scripts on the server, leading to full server compromise.\n*   **System Control:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to gain control of the server, manipulate data, and potentially disrupt the application's functionality or business operations.\n*   **Data Breach:** Attackers could potentially steal sensitive data stored on the server.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted POST request to `/add_achievement_details.php` with a malicious file included in the multipart/form-data.\n*   **File Upload Field:** The `ach_certy` field is used to upload the malicious file.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.\n* No prior authentication or special permissions are required to exploit this vulnerability\n\n**Technical Details**\n*   The provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates uploading a PHP file (`shell.php`) containing `<?php phpinfo();?>`. Once uploaded, accessing this file would execute the PHP code on the server.\n* The vulnerability exists because the application does not properly validate and sanitize the uploaded file data.\n\n**Suggested Fixes:**\n*   **Separate Storage:** Store uploaded files outside the web server's document root to prevent direct access and execution.\n*   **Rename Files:** Modify the names of uploaded files and their extensions to prevent execution (e.g., by adding a random hash and changing extensions).\n*   **Backend File Validation:** Implement server-side checks on file type, size, and content using MIME type validation or a library like `fileinfo` to avoid client side manipulations.\n*   **Path Separation:** Separate file upload paths based on services, and use generated filenames for download, adding an extra layer of security.",
