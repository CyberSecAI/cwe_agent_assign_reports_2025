# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-21738

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ata libata-sff Ensure that we cannot **write outside the allocated buffer** reveliofuzzing reported that a SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND ioctl with out_len set to 0xd42, SCSI command set to ATA_16 PASS-THROUGH, ATA command set to ATA_NOP, and protocol set to ATA_PROT_PIO, can cause ata_pio_sector() to **write outside the allocated buffer**, overwriting random memory. While a ATA device is supposed to abort a ATA_NOP command, there does seem to be a bug either in libata-sff or QEMU, where either this status is not set, or the status is cleared before read by ata_sff_hsm_move(). Anyway, that is most likely a separate bug. Looking at __atapi_pio_bytes(), it already has a safety check to ensure that __atapi_pio_bytes() cannot **write outside the allocated buffer**. Add a similar check to ata_pio_sector(), such that also ata_pio_sector() cannot **write outside the allocated buffer**.
