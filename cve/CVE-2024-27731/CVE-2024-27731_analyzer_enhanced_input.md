## Vulnerability Description
Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in Friendica v.2023.12 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information via the **lack of file type filtering in the file attachment parameter**.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **lack of file type filtering in the file attachment parameter**
- **weakness:** **cross-site scripting**
- **impact:** obtain sensitive information
- **attacker:** remote attacker
- **product:** Friendica
- **version:** v.2023.12

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-27731:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of validation on the type of files that can be uploaded to the media attachment endpoint in Friendica. This allows an attacker to upload files with arbitrary content, including HTML files containing malicious JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient File Type Validation:** The system does not check the type/content of uploaded files, allowing the upload of executable files like HTML.
- **Reflected XSS:** The uploaded HTML file, when accessed via a specific URL, is executed in the user's browser, leading to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject and execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser when they visit the link to the uploaded HTML file.
- **Potential for sensitive data theft:** The XSS vulnerability can be leveraged to steal user session cookies or password hashes, if the attacker crafts an appropriate payload.
- **Account takeover:** By stealing session cookies, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to a user's account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a malicious HTML file to the Friendica server using the media attachment endpoint.
- **Link Distribution:** The attacker shares a link to the uploaded file with a victim.
- **Victim Interaction:** The victim clicks the malicious link, which executes the embedded JavaScript in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Account on the Friendica instance:** An attacker needs to have a valid account on the Friendica instance to upload files.
- **Ability to create/share links:** An attacker must be able to generate a link to the uploaded malicious file and distribute it to potential victims.
- **Victim interaction:** The attacker needs the victim to click on the crafted malicious URL.

**Additional Notes:**

- The content specifically mentions that RCE (Remote Code Execution) through a PHP file upload was not possible because file content is stored in the database and not directly executed on the server.
- The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a specific URL that, when accessed, doesn't add the `Content-Disposition: attachment` header. This ensures the file is rendered and not downloaded by the browser.
- The fix for this issue involved preventing pass-through for attachments, meaning the server will not directly render the uploaded content as a web page.
