## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's a breakdown of the SQL injection vulnerability based on the provided content:

*   **Vulnerability:** SQL injection
*   **Affected Software:** Doctor's Appointment System V1.0
*   **Affected File:** admin/appointment.php
*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability exists because the application does not properly validate user input provided through the 'id' parameter. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and service interruption.
*   **Attack vector:** The attack is carried out by injecting malicious SQL code into the 'id' parameter of the admin/appointment.php file via a GET request.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Proof of Concept:** The provided content includes a proof of concept (POC) GET request that can be used to exploit the vulnerability. It also includes the output from the SQLmap tool to demonstrate the vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation/Fix:**
    1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This approach separates SQL code from user input, treating user input as data and preventing it from being interpreted as SQL code.
    2.  **Input validation and filtering:** Implement strict validation and filtering of user input to ensure it conforms to the expected format.
    3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** Use database accounts with the least necessary privileges.
    4.  **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular security audits of code and systems.
