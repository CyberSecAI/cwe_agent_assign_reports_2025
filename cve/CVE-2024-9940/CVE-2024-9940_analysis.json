  "description": "The Calculated Fields Form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to HTML Injection in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.45. This is due to the plugin not properly neutralizing HTML elements from submitted forms. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary HTML that will render when the administrator views form submissions in their email.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Vulnerability:** HTML Injection\n\n**Root Cause:** The Calculated Fields Form plugin fails to properly sanitize HTML elements submitted through forms. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary HTML code into form submissions.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n*   **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements:** The plugin does not adequately neutralize or encode HTML elements present in user-submitted data before displaying it. This allows the injected HTML to be interpreted as code by the browser when the administrator views the form submissions via email, potentially leading to unintended execution.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Arbitrary HTML Injection:** An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious HTML code.\n*   **Email Rendering Issues:**  When an administrator views the form submissions in their email client, the injected HTML will be rendered.\n*   The injected HTML could potentially be used for phishing, defacement, or other malicious purposes within the context of the email rendering.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Form Submission:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by submitting a form containing malicious HTML code. The vulnerable plugin does not properly sanitize the HTML when the data is sent via email.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any special privileges. They only need access to a form created by the vulnerable plugin.\n*   **Form Interaction:** The attacker must be able to submit data through a form created by the vulnerable plugin.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the Calculated Fields Form plugin up to and including 5.2.45.\n*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 5.2.46 by introducing a new \"accept_html\" attribute in field settings. When set to true, a field's value will not be sanitized, effectively allowing HTML code.\n*   The fix also includes sanitization logic for textareas and other fields if the accept_html attribute is set to false.\n*   The vulnerability was discovered by Max Boll (\\_b0lli) and reported through Wordfence.\n\nThis information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, providing a clear explanation of the vulnerability, its root cause, impact, and the fix implemented.",

While other CWEs like CWE-138 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements) are related, CWE-79 provides a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. The relationship analysis focused on finding the most specific CWE that accurately reflects the **root cause**, leading to the selection of CWE-79.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe138[\"CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe138\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe138 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of HTML elements in submitted forms (the **root cause**). This leads to the injection of arbitrary HTML, which is then rendered when the administrator views form submissions in their email, resulting in a potential impact of phishing or defacement.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary, which clearly states the **root cause** as the plugin's failure to properly sanitize HTML elements from submitted forms. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-79 as the most relevant CWE. The selection of CWE-79 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly describes the type of **improper neutralization** leading to cross-site scripting.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1236: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product saves user-provided information into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as a command when the file is opened by a spreadsheet product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
