## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The content relates to CVE-2025-5365. It provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the '/hms/admin/patient-search.php' file of the 'Online Hospital Management System' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter 'searchdata' and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

* SQL injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**

* The '/hms/admin/patient-search.php' file is vulnerable via the 'searchdata' parameter.
* No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

* An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

* Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
* Input validation and filtering.
* Minimize database user permissions.
* Regular security audits.

**Payload examples:**

*   `searchdata=11' AND (SELECT 7000 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))qdgI) AND 'KCUd'='KCUd&search=` (time-based blind SQL injection)
*   `searchdata=11' UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,CONCAT(0x7178626b71,0x7044494f4e504577596e555846565363434e6f46424d72616752664b475152746a4c464e63435471,0x71627a7a71),NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL-- -&search=` (UNION query)
