  "description": "A vulnerability was found in ouch-org ouch up to 0.3.1. It has been classified as critical. This affects the function oucharchivezipconvert_zip_date_time of the file zip.rs. The manipulation of the argument month leads to **memory corruption**. The attack needs to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 0.4.0 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.",
