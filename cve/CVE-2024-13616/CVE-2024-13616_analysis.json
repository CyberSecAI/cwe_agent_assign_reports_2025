The vulnerability description clearly states that the plugin **does not sanitise and escape some of its settings**, allowing high privilege users to perform Stored **Cross-Site Scripting** attacks. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the **root cause of the vulnerability** is that the plugin **does not sanitize and escape settings**, leading to cross-site scripting.
