Affected by this issue is the function test_custom_tool of the file introspect/backend/integration_routes.py of the component Test Endpoint. The manipulation of the argument input_model leads to code injection. Attacking locally is a requirement. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-4767 Content\n\nThe provided content is **RELATED** to a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. It provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description would.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is the use of `exec(request.input_model, namespace)` in the `/custom_tools/test` endpoint without proper sanitization of the `input_model` parameter.  Despite attempting to restrict execution using a namespace containing only `BaseModel` and `Field`, the `exec()` context allows attackers to bypass these restrictions.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Unsafe use of `exec()`:**  Executing arbitrary user-supplied code using `exec()` is inherently dangerous.\n*   **Namespace bypass:** The namespace restriction is insufficient to prevent code injection and execution of arbitrary commands.  Attackers can use `__import__` or `eval` to load forbidden modules.\n*   **Arbitrary Code Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary Python code.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation leads to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**, granting the attacker full control over the server's environment with the server\u2019s privileges.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker can craft a malicious `input_model` payload containing arbitrary Python code.\n*   The payload is sent to the `/custom_tools/test` endpoint.\n*   The `exec()` function executes the malicious code.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the `/custom_tools/test` endpoint. No authentication is mentioned as a requirement in the provided text.\n*   The attacker needs to understand Python and be able to craft a malicious payload that bypasses the namespace restrictions.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not explicitly state a fix, but it implies that avoiding the use of `exec()` with user-supplied input is the primary mitigation.  Alternatively, a much more robust and secure input validation and sanitization mechanism would be required if `exec()` is absolutely necessary. The pull request #501 is mentioned as closing the issue, suggesting a fix was implemented.\n\n**Affected versions:**\n\n*   v0.1.0 to v0.1.4\n*   The latest main branch also contains the vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The content provides a concrete example of a malicious payload.\n*   It explains *how* the namespace bypass works, detailing the use of `__import__` and other techniques.\n*   It points to the specific line of code in `tool_routes.py` where the vulnerability exists.\n*   It provides a link to the commit where the vulnerable code was introduced.",

CWE-95 accurately describes the vulnerability due to the use of `exec()` with user-controlled input.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe95[\"CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe95 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe95 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe95 primary\n    class cwe94,cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper use of the `exec()` function (CWE-95)**, which leads to **arbitrary code execution**. The lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to inject malicious code.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based on the detailed information provided in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which explicitly states that the root cause is the use of `exec(request.input_model, namespace)` without proper sanitization. The evidence points directly to CWE-95 as the most appropriate classification. The retriever results also highlight CWE-95 as a strong candidate. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-95 is a more specific variant of the broader CWE-94 and CWE-74.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g. \"eval\").\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
