CWE-204 [Observable Response Discrepancy] is a Base-level CWE and a more specific type of information exposure, where different responses reveal information. CWE-204 is a good candidate because it is a base level CWE, and is more specific to the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe204[\"CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\"]\n    \n    cwe204 -->|PEEROF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe204 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect** handling of authentication attempts. This leads to different error messages being displayed depending on whether the user exists, effectively enabling user enumeration. The chain is:\n\n1.  **Incorrect** authentication handling (different error messages)\n2.  Information Exposure (user enumeration)\n\nThe **root cause** is the information exposure due to the observable discrepancy in the error messages.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] as the primary CWE due to the **exposure of sensitive information**. However, CWE-204 [Observable Response Discrepancy] provides a more specific description of the **root cause**, as the vulnerability arises from different responses based on user existence.\n\nThe evidence supporting this assessment comes directly from the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary, which explicitly states that different error messages are returned for failed authentication attempts depending on whether the user exists or not.\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] and CWE-204 [Observable Response Discrepancy] is at an appropriate level of specificity. While CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] is a class-level CWE, it accurately reflects the nature of the vulnerability. CWE-204 [Observable Response Discrepancy] is a Base-level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
