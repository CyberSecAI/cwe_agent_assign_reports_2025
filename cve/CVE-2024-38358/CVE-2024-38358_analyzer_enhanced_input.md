## Vulnerability Description
Wasmer is a web assembly (wasm) Runtime supporting WASIX, WASI and Emscripten. If the preopened directory has a symlink pointing outside, WASI programs can traverse the symlink and access host filesystem if the caller sets both `oflagscreat` and `rightsfd_write`. Programs can also crash the runtime by creating a symlink pointing outside with `path_symlink` and `path_open`ing the link. This issue has been addressed in commit `b9483d022` which has been included in release version 4.3.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** access host filesystem
- **vector:** symlink pointing outside
- **attacker:** WASI programs
- **product:** Wasmer
- **version:** before 4.3.2

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-38358:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient checks when handling symlinks within the WASI filesystem sandbox in Wasmer. Specifically, when a preopened directory contains a symlink pointing outside the sandbox, the `path_open` syscall, when used with both `oflags::creat` and `rights::fd_write`, can be exploited to traverse the symlink, bypassing the intended security restrictions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Symlink Traversal:** The primary weakness is the ability to traverse symlinks that lead outside the designated filesystem sandbox. This violates the principle of least privilege and allows access to potentially sensitive areas of the host filesystem.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code lacks proper validation to ensure that symlink targets remain within the boundaries of the sandboxed file system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Filesystem Access:** A malicious WASI program can read and write to files outside the sandboxed directory.
- **Potential for Data Breach:**  By accessing arbitrary files on the host system, attackers could potentially steal sensitive data.
- **Denial of Service:** Attackers could potentially crash the runtime by creating symlinks that point outside the sandbox.
- **Sandbox Escape:** This bypasses the security provided by the filesystem sandbox.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious WASI program is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- The program must call the `path_open` syscall with specific flags (`oflags::creat` and `rights::fd_write`).
- The program must attempt to open a file through a symlink that points outside the sandboxed directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute a WASI program within a Wasmer environment.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to control the program's behavior to use the vulnerable `path_open` syscall.
- The attacker must be aware of the symlink structure within the preopened directory.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found by `yagehu`.
- The affected versions are Wasmer versions 4.3.1 and earlier.
- No patch is mentioned, indicating that the vulnerability might have been fixed in later versions.
- The provided PoC demonstrates how a simple Rust program compiled to WASI can exploit the vulnerability by reading from a file outside the sandbox.
- Wasmtime, another WebAssembly runtime, is mentioned as being able to successfully block this type of call, indicating that this is a Wasmer specific issue.
