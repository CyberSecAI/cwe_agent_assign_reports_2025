### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **Cross Application Scripting**
- **impact:** local code injection and manipulate the view
- **product:** Vercom S.A. Redlink SDK
- **version:** through 1.13

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6051:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an "Improper Control of Resource Identifiers ('Resource Injection')", specifically categorized as CWE-99. This means the Redlink SDK doesn't properly validate or sanitize resource identifiers, allowing an attacker to inject malicious content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Resource Injection:** The core vulnerability lies in the SDK's failure to properly handle resource identifiers, which enables the injection of malicious code.
- **Cross Application Scripting:** The vulnerability is explicitly described as "Cross Application Scripting". This indicates that injected code can be executed within the context of the vulnerable application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Injection:** Attackers can inject and execute malicious code.
- **Manipulation of Application View:** The injected code can be used to manipulate the user interface or the way the application displays data, which may lead to various malicious outcomes.
- **Local Code Execution:** The provided description states "local execution of code" can happen.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability exists within the Redlink SDK, suggesting that any application using the SDK is susceptible.
- The content implies that the exploitation involves injecting code through a resource identifier, but no specific details on how that identifier is manipulated is given.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the resource identifier that the Redlink SDK is using to load resources. The specific method of influencing the identifier is not specified.
- Since the vulnerability is "local execution of code" in the Polish version, this suggests that some kind of access to the machine is necessary.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of Redlink SDK up to and including version 1.13.
- The report was made to CERT Polska and coordinated by them.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Maksymilian Motyl from Immunity Systems.
