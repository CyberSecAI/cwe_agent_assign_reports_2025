  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6051:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability is due to an \"Improper Control of Resource Identifiers ('Resource Injection')\", specifically categorized as CWE-99. This means the Redlink SDK doesn't properly validate or sanitize resource identifiers, allowing an attacker to inject malicious content.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Resource Injection:** The core vulnerability lies in the SDK's failure to properly handle resource identifiers, which enables the injection of malicious code.\n- **Cross Application Scripting:** The vulnerability is explicitly described as \"Cross Application Scripting\". This indicates that injected code can be executed within the context of the vulnerable application.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Code Injection:** Attackers can inject and execute malicious code.\n- **Manipulation of Application View:** The injected code can be used to manipulate the user interface or the way the application displays data, which may lead to various malicious outcomes.\n- **Local Code Execution:** The provided description states \"local execution of code\" can happen.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The vulnerability exists within the Redlink SDK, suggesting that any application using the SDK is susceptible.\n- The content implies that the exploitation involves injecting code through a resource identifier, but no specific details on how that identifier is manipulated is given.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to influence the resource identifier that the Redlink SDK is using to load resources. The specific method of influencing the identifier is not specified.\n- Since the vulnerability is \"local execution of code\" in the Polish version, this suggests that some kind of access to the machine is necessary.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerability affects all versions of Redlink SDK up to and including version 1.13.\n- The report was made to CERT Polska and coordinated by them.\n- The vulnerability was discovered by Maksymilian Motyl from Immunity Systems.",

The vulnerability description indicates code injection, which aligns with CWE-94. CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') is a secondary weakness, as the code injection leads to cross-application scripting.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe98[\"CWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement ('Remote File Inclusion')\"]\n    \n    cwe94 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe98\n    cwe94 -->|LEADS_TO| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n    class cwe98 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Control of Resource Identifiers ('Resource Injection')**, leading to **Code Injection** (CWE-94), which then results in **Cross Application Scripting** (CWE-79) and manipulation of the application view.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-94 as the primary weakness due to the code injection aspect. The vulnerability description and CVE reference summary support this, stating that the issue allows local code injection. The retriever results also list CWE-94 with a high score. The **Cross Application Scripting** is a secondary effect of the code injection, making CWE-79 a relevant but secondary mapping. The provided evidence supports the selection of these CWEs, particularly the root cause analysis indicating an \"Improper Control of Resource Identifiers ('Resource Injection')\" ultimately leading to code injection.
