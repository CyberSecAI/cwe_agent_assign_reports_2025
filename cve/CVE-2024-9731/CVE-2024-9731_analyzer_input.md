# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-9731

## Vulnerability Description
Trimble SketchUp Viewer SKP File Parsing Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Trimble SketchUp Viewer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of SKP files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a **memory corruption** condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24145.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9731:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of SKP files within Trimble SketchUp Viewer.
- The core issue is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during SKP file processing. This insufficient validation leads to a memory corruption condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption due to inadequate input validation when parsing SKP files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the currently running SketchUp Viewer process. This means the attacker can gain control over the application and potentially the system it's running on.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability.
- The attack requires user interaction. The user must either:
   - Visit a malicious web page, or
   - Open a malicious SKP file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious SKP file or host a malicious web page that can trigger the memory corruption in SketchUp Viewer.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into either opening the malicious SKP file or visiting the malicious website.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions that the vulnerability was reported to Trimble on May 9th, 2024, but does not specify if a patch has been released.
- The mitigation advice given is to restrict user interaction with the application, which is a generic mitigation and not a specific patch.
- The CVSS score is 7.8, indicating a high severity vulnerability, particularly because of the potential for arbitrary code execution.
