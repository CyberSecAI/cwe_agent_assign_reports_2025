  "description": "Trimble SketchUp Viewer SKP File Parsing Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Trimble SketchUp Viewer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of SKP files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a **memory corruption** condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24145.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9731:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of SKP files within Trimble SketchUp Viewer.\n- The core issue is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during SKP file processing. This insufficient validation leads to a memory corruption condition.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- Memory corruption due to inadequate input validation when parsing SKP files.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the currently running SketchUp Viewer process. This means the attacker can gain control over the application and potentially the system it's running on.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability.\n- The attack requires user interaction. The user must either:\n   - Visit a malicious web page, or\n   - Open a malicious SKP file.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious SKP file or host a malicious web page that can trigger the memory corruption in SketchUp Viewer.\n- The attacker needs to trick the user into either opening the malicious SKP file or visiting the malicious website.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The advisory mentions that the vulnerability was reported to Trimble on May 9th, 2024, but does not specify if a patch has been released.\n- The mitigation advice given is to restrict user interaction with the application, which is a generic mitigation and not a specific patch.\n- The CVSS score is 7.8, indicating a high severity vulnerability, particularly because of the potential for arbitrary code execution.",

It is related to CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), a class-level CWE. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a class-level CWE that can lead to buffer overflows. The relationship between these CWEs is that improper input validation can lead to out-of-bounds writes.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-20), which leads to **memory corruption** (CWE-787). The impact of this is Remote Code Execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a memory corruption condition due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data. The evidence is strong because the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section identifies \"lack of proper validation of user-supplied data\" as the root cause and \"memory corruption\" as the weakness. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also confirms that the root cause is the lack of proper validation, which leads to memory corruption.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is considered as a secondary candidate because the root cause is the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**. However, CWE-20 is a class-level CWE and the description doesn't provide enough information to specify exactly what kind of input validation is missing. Therefore, it's best to focus on the more direct consequence, which is the out-of-bounds write.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the **memory corruption** condition. While CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a parent of CWE-787, CWE-787 provides a more precise description of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.

It is related to CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), a class-level CWE. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a class-level CWE that can lead to buffer overflows. The relationship between these CWEs is that improper input validation can lead to out-of-bounds writes.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-20), which leads to **memory corruption** (CWE-787). The impact of this is Remote Code Execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a memory corruption condition due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data. The evidence is strong because the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section identifies \"lack of proper validation of user-supplied data\" as the root cause and \"memory corruption\" as the weakness. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also confirms that the root cause is the lack of proper validation, which leads to memory corruption.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is considered as a secondary candidate because the root cause is the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**. However, CWE-20 is a class-level CWE and the description doesn't provide enough information to specify exactly what kind of input validation is missing. Therefore, it's best to focus on the more direct consequence, which is the out-of-bounds write.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the **memory corruption** condition. While CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a parent of CWE-787, CWE-787 provides a more precise description of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
