However, the vulnerability description mentions \"**Information Exposure** vulnerability\" and \"low impact on confidentiality\". |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship is that CWE-284 is a high-level Pillar, and many more specific CWEs could be children of it. CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE that can result from improper access control, but is discouraged to use as a primary mapping.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Access Control (CWE-284)**, which leads to **Information Exposure (CWE-200)**, ultimately resulting in a security feature bypass.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which clearly states that the **root cause** is **Improper Access Control (CWE-284)**. The vulnerability description also mentions **Information Exposure**, which aligns with **CWE-200**.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-200 can be a consequence of CWE-284.\n\nCWE-284 is selected as the primary CWE because it represents the **root cause**. Although it is a high-level Pillar, the provided evidence directly points to it. CWE-200 is included as a secondary CWE because it describes the immediate impact of the vulnerability i.e. **Information Exposure**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reasoning: This CWE is too specific. The provided context doesn't indicate that the exposure is specifically related to \"system-level information.\"*\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].\n\n*Reasoning: Included as a secondary CWE since it describes the **Information Exposure**.*\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reasoning: This CWE is too specific.

  "analysis_with_relationships": "# Summary\n| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.9 | Pillar | Primary | Allowed, based on CVE Reference Links Content Summary which states \"**Root Cause:** Improper Access Control\" |\n| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged. However, the vulnerability description mentions \"**Information Exposure** vulnerability\" and \"low impact on confidentiality\". |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship is that CWE-284 is a high-level Pillar, and many more specific CWEs could be children of it. CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE that can result from improper access control, but is discouraged to use as a primary mapping.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Access Control (CWE-284)**, which leads to **Information Exposure (CWE-200)**, ultimately resulting in a security feature bypass.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which clearly states that the **root cause** is **Improper Access Control (CWE-284)**. The vulnerability description also mentions **Information Exposure**, which aligns with **CWE-200**.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-200 can be a consequence of CWE-284.\n\nCWE-284 is selected as the primary CWE because it represents the **root cause**. Although it is a high-level Pillar, the provided evidence directly points to it. CWE-200 is included as a secondary CWE because it describes the immediate impact of the vulnerability i.e. **Information Exposure**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reasoning: This CWE is too specific. The provided context doesn't indicate that the exposure is specifically related to \"system-level information.\"*\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other options are often available. [REF-1287].\n\n*Reasoning: Included as a secondary CWE since it describes the **Information Exposure**.*\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reasoning: This CWE is too specific.
