  "description": "CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. In 1.3.3 and earlier, a **heap buffer overflow** vulnerability persists in the Crypto_TC_ApplySecurity function due to an **incomplete validation check** on the fl (frame length) field. Although CVE-2025-29912 addressed an underflow issue involving fl, the patch fails to fully prevent unsafe calculations. As a result, an attacker can still craft malicious frames that cause a negative tf_payload_len, which is then interpreted as a large unsigned value, leading to a **heap buffer overflow** in a memcpy call.",

This can lead to CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write, where a negative value is misinterpreted as a large positive value due to conversion to an unsigned integer, ultimately causing the overflow.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe191[\"CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe191 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe191 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an incomplete validation check on the frame length (`fl`). This leads to an Integer Underflow (CWE-191) when calculating `tf_payload_len`. Because `tf_payload_len` is cast to an unsigned integer, the negative value wraps around to a large positive value. This large value is then used in a `memcpy` call, leading to a Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-787), resulting in a potential denial of service or remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, which includes the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The key phrases highlight the \"**incomplete validation check**\" as the root cause, leading to a \"**heap buffer overflow**\". The CVE summary explicitly mentions both \"**Integer underflow (CWE-191)**\" and \"**Heap buffer overflow (CWE-787)**\".\n\nThe relationship graph illustrates how the Integer Underflow can precede and lead to an Out-of-bounds Write. The selected CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, providing the most specific representation of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-119, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, was considered but not selected as the primary CWE because it is a class-level CWE and less specific than CWE-787. CWE-190 Integer Overflow was also considered but not selected because the vulnerability involves an underflow, not an overflow. CWE-1284 Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input was considered, but the root cause is more specifically an integer underflow than a general lack of validation.\n\nRelevant CWE
