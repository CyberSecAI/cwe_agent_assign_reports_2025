  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved exfat fix random stack corruption after get_block When get_block is called with a buffer_head allocated on the stack, such as do_mpage_readpage, stack corruption due to buffer_head UAF may occur in the following race condition situation. mpage_read_folio > do_mpage_readpage exfat_get_block bh_read __bh_read get_bh(bh) submit_bh wait_on_buffer ... end_buffer_read_sync __end_buffer_read_notouch unlock_buffer > ... ... ... ... > . . another_function > put_bh(bh) atomic_dec(bh->b_count) * stack corruption here * This patch returns -EAGAIN if a folio does not have buffers when bh_read needs to be called. By doing this, the caller can fallback to functions like block_read_full_folio(), create a buffer_head in the folio, and then call get_block again. Lets do not call bh_read() with on-stack buffer_head.",
