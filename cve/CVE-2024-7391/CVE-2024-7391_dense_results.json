  "query": "ChargePoint Home Flex Bluetooth Low Energy Information Disclosure Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of ChargePoint Home Flex charging devices. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the Wi-Fi setup logic. By connecting to the device over Bluetooth Low Energy during the setup process, an attacker can obtain Wi-Fi credentials. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose credentials and gain access to the device owners Wi-Fi network. Was ZDI-CAN-21454.",
