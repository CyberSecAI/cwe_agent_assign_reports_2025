The vulnerability description clearly indicates the disclosure of Wi-Fi credentials, making this a relevant classification. Secondary CWEs considered include CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission) and CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), which provide more specific details about how the information is exposed. These are related to CWE-200 as potential methods of exposure. The choice of CWE-200 as primary is due to the overarching theme of information exposure, with the other CWEs detailing the specific mechanisms.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe319 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe200\n    cwe522 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe319,cwe522 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **weakness** in the Wi-Fi setup logic, leading to **Exposure of Sensitive Information (CWE-200)**. The information disclosed is Wi-Fi credentials, and the method of disclosure involves connecting via Bluetooth Low Energy. Depending on the implementation details, this might involve **Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319)** or **Insufficiently Protected Credentials (CWE-522)**. The final impact is that an attacker gains access to the device owner's Wi-Fi network.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the associated CVE reference links. The key phrase \"Information Disclosure Vulnerability\" directly supports the selection of CWE-200 as the primary CWE. The description also mentions that an attacker can \"obtain Wi-Fi credentials\" by connecting to the device over Bluetooth Low Energy. The retriever results also listed CWE-200 at the top, further supporting its selection.\n\nCWE-319 was considered as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability description indicates that the Wi-Fi credentials are being transmitted over Bluetooth Low Energy, and if this transmission is not encrypted, it would constitute a cleartext transmission. CWE-522 was considered because the credentials could be insufficiently protected during the setup process.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision by highlighting the connections between different types of information exposure vulnerabilities. This helped to identify the most appropriate CWEs to represent the different aspects of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately reflect the nature of the vulnerability based on the available evidence. While more specific CWEs might exist, there is not enough information to determine whether they are applicable.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were
