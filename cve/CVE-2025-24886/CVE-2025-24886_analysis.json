The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-59 Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following'). This is a Base level CWE which is ideal. CWE-61 UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following is a compound weakness, but it accurately describes the scenario so is included as a secondary weakness. CWE-200 Information Exposure is included as the final impact of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe59[\"CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\"]\n    cwe61[\"CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Information Exposure\"]\n    \n    cwe61 -->|PEEROF| cwe59\n    cwe59 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe59 primary\n    class cwe61 secondary\n    class cwe200 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **incorrect symlink checks** (CWE-59), which leads to the ability to perform an LFI, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence. The key phrase \"**Incorrect symlink checks on user specified dojos**\" directly points to a problem with how symlinks are handled, which is the root cause. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further confirms this with the statement \"Incorrect symlink checks on user-specified dojos allows for users to perform an LFI from the CTFd container.\"\n\nCWE-59 (Improper Link Resolution Before File Access) is the most accurate primary CWE because it directly addresses the **failure to properly prevent a filename from resolving to an unintended resource via a link**. This is further supported by the retriever results and the provided descriptions. CWE-61 (UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following) is a related issue, but CWE-59 is a more general root cause.
