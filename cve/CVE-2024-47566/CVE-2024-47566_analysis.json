This is the root cause of the vulnerability. |\n| CWE-23 | Relative Path Traversal | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate.

CWE-23, **Relative Path Traversal**, is a child of CWE-22, representing a specific type of path traversal. While the description mentions \"relative path traversal vulnerabilities,\" it also refers to a more general **improper limitation of a pathname**, suggesting that CWE-22 is a more fitting primary classification.

The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also points to **Path Traversal** [CWE-23] vulnerabilities.\n\nThe retriever results list CWE-22 as the top result and CWE-23 as a secondary possibility.
