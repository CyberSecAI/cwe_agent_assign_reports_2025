# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-37794

## Vulnerability Description
**Improper input validation** in CVC5 Solver v1.1.3 allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted SMT2 input file.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Improper input validation**
- **impact:** Denial of Service (DoS)
- **vector:** crafted SMT2 input file
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** CVC5 Solver
- **version:** v1.1.3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in the cvc5 SMT solver. Here's a breakdown of the relevant issues, focusing on the ones likely associated with CVE-2024-37794:

**Vulnerability 1: Division by Zero Crash**

*   **Root Cause:** The cvc5 solver crashed due to a division by zero error when parsing the input `(assert (= (+ x y) 5/0))`.
*   **Weakness:** The parser did not handle division by zero gracefully. Instead of returning a parsing error, it triggered a floating-point exception, leading to a crash.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service through application crash.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Specially crafted SMT2 input file with division by zero.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to provide input to the cvc5 solver.

**Vulnerability 2: Invalid Bit-Vector Size**

*   **Root Cause:** The solver did not report an error for invalid bit-vector size.
*   **Weakness:** The parser allowed a bit-vector declaration with size -2 which is invalid. Instead of an error it produced wrong output.
*   **Impact:** Incorrect output/potential further issues.
*  **Attack Vector:** Specially crafted SMT2 input file with an invalid bit-vector size.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to provide input to the cvc5 solver.

**Vulnerability 3: Segfault due to format string**

*   **Root Cause:** A segmentation fault occurred when the `set-logic` command contained a format string specifier (`%s`).
*   **Weakness:**  The parser was using a format string without proper sanitization.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service through application crash.
*   **Attack Vector:** Specially crafted SMT2 input file with format string specifier in the logic definition.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to provide input to the cvc5 solver.

**Resolution:**

*   The division by zero issue was addressed by adding a guard in the code to handle the division by zero case correctly (PR #10804 and #10818).
*   The invalid bit-vector size issue was also fixed by PR #10818.
*   The format string vulnerability was fixed by PR #10945, which replaced the unsafe call to the `IllegalArgument` macro.

**CVE-2024-37794 Association:**

Based on the discussion, CVE-2024-37794 is likely associated with one of the first two issues: the **division by zero crash** or the **invalid bit-vector size issue**, as these were addressed in the same fix. CVE-2024-37795 is likely associated with the third issue (format string vulnerability). This is also stated in a comment by user carnil: "it looks there are two CVEs assigned to issues related to this filled issue: [CVE-2024-37794](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-frw3-949h-qqfj "CVE-2024-37794") and [CVE-2024-37795](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hvrf-34fw-qpr2 "CVE-2024-37795")".

**Summary**

The provided text details a series of input validation vulnerabilities in the cvc5 SMT solver which allowed for denial of service or incorrect output. These issues were addressed through a series of patches that improved error handling.
