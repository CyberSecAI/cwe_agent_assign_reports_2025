# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-3561

## Vulnerability Description
The Custom Field Suite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the the Term custom field in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.7 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-3561:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content, specifically from `www.wordfence.com`, directly mentions "CVE-2024-3561" and describes a SQL Injection vulnerability in the "Custom Field Suite" WordPress plugin, which is also mentioned in the other sources. Thus the content is relevant to the CVE.

**2. Vulnerability details:**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient escaping of user-supplied parameters and a lack of adequate preparation in the existing SQL query within the 'Term' custom field of the Custom Field Suite plugin.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  SQL Injection vulnerability exists due to improper handling of user input within the SQL query.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary SQL queries which can lead to the extraction of sensitive information from the database. The CVSS score is 8.8 (High) indicating a significant impact
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, and the vulnerability is triggered through the 'Term' custom field within the plugin.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be authenticated with at least contributor-level access to exploit this vulnerability.

**3. Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located within the `term.php` file of the Custom Field Suite plugin, specifically line 58 as referenced in the wordfence article and confirmed in the github source file.
*   The vulnerable code involves a SQL query that retrieves term data based on the user-provided `term_id` values. Due to lack of proper sanitization of this `term_id`, attackers can manipulate it to inject their own SQL commands.
*   The Wordfence article explicitly states that "This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database."

**4. Additional Information:**

* The plugin has been closed as of 20 August 2024 and is not available for download, as described on the wordpress.org page.
* The Wordfence article states that no patch is available, thus manual mitigation may be needed and it may be best to uninstall the affected software.

In summary, CVE-2024-3561 is a high-severity SQL injection vulnerability in the Custom Field Suite plugin, affecting all versions up to 2.6.7. It allows authenticated users with contributor-level access or higher to execute arbitrary SQL queries by manipulating the `term_id` within the "Term" custom field.
