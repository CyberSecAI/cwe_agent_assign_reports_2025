  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpf devmap provide rxq after redirect rxq contains a pointer to the device from where the redirect happened. Currently, the BPF program that was executed after a redirect via BPF_MAP_TYPE_DEVMAP* does not have it set. This is particularly bad since accessing ingress_ifindex, e.g. SEC(xdp) int prog(struct xdp_md *pkt) { return bpf_redirect_map(&dev_redirect_map, 0, 0) } SEC(xdp/devmap) int prog_after_redirect(struct xdp_md *pkt) { bpf_printk(ifindex %i, pkt->ingress_ifindex) return XDP_PASS } depends on access to rxq, so a NULL pointer gets dereferenced [ 574.475170]",
