# Analysis for CVE-2024-10846

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-674 | Uncontrolled Recursion | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion), which is a Class-level CWE. While it is possible that a more specific Base-level CWE exists, the description strongly suggests uncontrolled recursion as the root cause. CWE-674 is related to CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) as recursion is a means for resource consumption. CWE-674 can lead to CWE-400 if the recursion is not properly limited, thus consuming excessive resources.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a malicious YAML payload submitted by an authorized user. The `compose-go` library then attempts to parse this YAML, leading to **uncontrolled recursion**. This **uncontrolled recursion** causes excessive memory and CPU consumption, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis pointed towards several potential CWEs, particularly those related to resource consumption and loop vulnerabilities. However, the key phrase "recursive loop" and the GitHub content clearly indicate that the root cause is **uncontrolled recursion** during YAML parsing. The vulnerability description mentions "consume excessive amount of Memory and CPU cycles" which means the recursion leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption**.

The evidence supporting this assessment is strong, with the GitHub content explicitly mentioning a "recursive loop." The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity given the available information.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-409: Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.65
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles a compressed input with a very high compression ratio that produces a large output.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.65
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.65
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component
in another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the
intended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.65
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.65
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
An algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-277: Insecure Inherited Permissions
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.64
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product defines a set of insecure permissions that are inherited by objects that are created by the program.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.64
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')
