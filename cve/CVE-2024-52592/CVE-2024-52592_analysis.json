  "description": "Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. In affected versions **missing validation** in `ApInboxService.update` allows an attacker to modify the result of polls belonging to another user. No authentication is required, except for a valid signature from any actor on any remote instance. Vulnerable Misskey instances will accept spoofed updates for remote polls. Local polls are unaffected. This issue has been addressed in version 2024.11.0-alpha.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "The content is related to CVE-2024-52592.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nMissing validation in `ApInboxService.update`.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation when updating poll results through the `ApInboxService.update` function. This allows external actors to modify poll results.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nSuccessful exploitation allows an attacker to modify the results of polls belonging to other users. Local polls are not affected, but remote polls on vulnerable Misskey instances can be manipulated. The integrity of poll results is compromised, which could lead to misinformation or skewed outcomes.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send a crafted update request to the vulnerable Misskey instance over the network.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nThe attacker does not require any specific privileges on the target instance to exploit the vulnerability. They need to be able to send network requests. The attack only requires a valid signature from any actor on any remote instance.",

The attacker can modify the poll results because the application doesn't properly verify if the actor has the authority to perform the update.\n\nThe CWE relationships that impacted the decision are:\n\n*   CWE-862 is a Class-level CWE, but it directly addresses the **missing authorization** issue.\n*   CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature) is considered as a secondary weakness because the vulnerability description mentions that a valid signature is required, however, the signature is not properly verified against the authorized actor.\n*   CWE-807 (Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision) is a peer weakness because the application relies on the input data without proper validation, leading to the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe807[\"CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\"]\n\n    cwe347 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe862\n    cwe807 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe347,cwe807 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is as follows:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Missing authorization** check in `ApInboxService.update` (CWE-862).\n2.  The system relies on a valid signature, but does not validate the authorization of the signature's actor to update the poll (CWE-347 and CWE-807).\n3.  **Impact:** An attacker modifies the results of polls belonging to another user.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **missing authorization** check in `ApInboxService.update`. The vulnerability description explicitly states that there is **missing validation** in `ApInboxService.update` which allows an attacker to modify the poll results. This aligns with the definition of CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), as the application does not check whether the user is authorized to perform the update.\n\nThe Retriever Results also list CWE-862 as a potential candidate, further supporting this classification. CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature) and CWE-807 (Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision) are considered as secondary weaknesses because a valid signature is required, but the signature is not properly checked against the authorized actor.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause and contributing factors of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
