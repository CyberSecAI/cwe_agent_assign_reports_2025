CWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity) could be the root cause that leads to uncontrolled resource consumption. The abstraction levels were considered, favoring more specific Base level CWEs when possible, but the evidence points to higher-level Class CWEs as the most accurate representation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    \n    cwe400 <--|CAUSES| cwe407\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe407 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an attacker publishing a crafted DNS zone.

The primary impact is a denial of service due to uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400). The root cause is related to inefficient processing, which aligns with Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity (CWE-407). The relationship graph shows how inefficient algorithms can lead to uncontrolled resource consumption.
