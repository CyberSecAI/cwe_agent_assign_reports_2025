## Vulnerability Description
SNMP objects in NET-SNMP used in ORing IAP-420 allows **Command Injection**.This issue affects IAP-420 through 2.01e.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **Command Injection**
- **product:** ORing IAP-420
- **version:** through 2.01e
- **component:** SNMP objects in NET-SNMP

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-55547:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the way the ORing IAP-420 device handles SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) `nsExtendObjects`. Specifically, the ability to write to `nsExtendObjects` allows for remote command execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** The primary vulnerability is that by writing to the `nsExtendObjects` via SNMP, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the device's operating system. This is due to insufficient input validation or sanitization of the commands being written to the SNMP objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Device Control:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain complete control over the device.
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Attackers can execute any commands they wish on the device's operating system. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, including data theft, installation of malware, and further network compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SNMP:** The vulnerability is exploited through SNMP, by writing to the `nsExtendObjects` OID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the ORing IAP-420 device.
*   **SNMP Access:** The attacker must have the ability to interact with the device through SNMP. In this case, the default community string “public” appears to be used.

**Additional details:**
* The provided content gives more detailed information about the vulnerability compared to the standard CVE description, including the specific SNMP objects involved, the method of exploitation using `snmpset` and `snmpwalk` and a detailed proof of concept.
*  The device is vulnerable because it allows writing to the `nsExtendObjects` through SNMP without proper validation, enabling the execution of arbitrary operating system commands.
