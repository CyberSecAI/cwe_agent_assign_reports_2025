The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this as the root cause: \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** Out of bounds write in V8.\"\n\nCWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is the most appropriate mapping because it directly corresponds to the vulnerability described. The provided information explicitly identifies the weakness as an out-of-bounds write, making this a confident and direct mapping.\n\nOther CWEs were considered, particularly those related to memory corruption and buffer overflows, but none matched the description as precisely as CWE-787.\n- CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) was considered since the description mentions \"heap corruption\", but the root cause is explicitly an out-of-bounds write, not necessarily a buffer overflow.\n- CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) was also considered, but the description specifies a write, not a read.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
