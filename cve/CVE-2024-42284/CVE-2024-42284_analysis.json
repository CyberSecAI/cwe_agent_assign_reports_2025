  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved tipc Return non-zero value from tipc_udp_addr2str() on error tipc_udp_addr2str() should return non-zero value if the UDP media address is invalid. Otherwise, a **buffer overflow** access can occur in tipc_media_addr_printf(). Fix this by returning 1 on an invalid UDP media address.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe `tipc_udp_addr2str()` function in the Linux kernel's TIPC (Transparent Inter-Process Communication) module did not properly handle invalid UDP media addresses. It would attempt to format an invalid address, which would lead to a buffer overflow in `tipc_media_addr_printf()`.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a potential buffer overflow when an invalid UDP media address is processed by `tipc_media_addr_printf()`, due to `tipc_udp_addr2str` not validating the address.\n- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `tipc_udp_addr2str()` function didn't check the validity of the UDP media address before using it in `snprintf`, leading to the overflow.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Denial of Service:** A buffer overflow can crash the kernel, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.\n- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** Depending on the kernel configuration and exploit details, a successful buffer overflow can potentially be leveraged for arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges, but this is not explicitly confirmed in the provided context.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- An attacker could craft an invalid UDP media address that, when passed to `tipc_udp_addr2str`, would trigger the overflow.\n- This likely involves interaction with the TIPC subsystem, possibly through network interfaces or TIPC sockets.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- An attacker needs to be able to interact with the TIPC subsystem and pass a malformed UDP media address that can reach the vulnerable code path.\n- This likely requires some form of privileged access to influence the TIPC configuration, potentially requiring root or other high-privilege account.\n- The attacker has to be able to send network packets or have access to the TIPC subsystem in a way that it would trigger the address conversion to string.\n\n**Fix:**\nThe fix involves modifying `tipc_udp_addr2str()` to return a non-zero value (specifically 1) when an invalid UDP media address is encountered. This prevents `tipc_media_addr_printf()` from attempting to process the invalid address, thus avoiding the buffer overflow. A `pr_err` call was added to log the error as well.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The fix is related to commit `d0f91938bede` which introduced the ip/udp media type.\n- The provided content includes multiple commits that implement the same fix across different branches.\n\nIn summary, the vulnerability is a buffer overflow due to a lack of validation of UDP media addresses, which could lead to a denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution. The fix ensures the invalid address will be handled by returning an error code to the caller.",

The **lack of validation** allows a crafted input to cause a **buffer overflow** during the copy operation. Both are base level CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    \n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe120\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe120 primary\n    class cwe1284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper validation** of the UDP media address, leading to a **buffer overflow** when the address is processed and copied without proper size checks.\n- The root cause is the **lack of validation** (`tipc_udp_addr2str` function didn't check the validity of the UDP media address before using it in `snprintf`).\n- The vulnerability is the **buffer overflow** (`tipc_media_addr_printf()` attempts to process the invalid address, causing the overflow).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on the buffer overflow. The key point is the **lack of validation** in `tipc_udp_addr2str()`, which leads to the overflow in `tipc_media_addr_printf()`. The evidence provided clearly indicates both the **buffer overflow** and the **missing validation**.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-120 because the immediate cause of the vulnerability is a buffer copy without checking the size of the input. CWE-1284 is a secondary CWE because the root cause is the **improper validation** of the input.
