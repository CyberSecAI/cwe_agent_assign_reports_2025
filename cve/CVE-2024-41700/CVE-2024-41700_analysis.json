While more specific CWEs exist, the vulnerability description lacks sufficient detail to pinpoint a more precise root cause. The other candidate CWEs are children of CWE-200 or related to exposure of sensitive information, but the information available isn't detailed enough to establish a specific link.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe1258[\"CWE-1258: Exposure of Sensitive System Information Due to Uncleared Debug Information\"]\n    \n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe209 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe1258 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe359,cwe497,cwe209,cwe1258 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is simple: **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** (CWE-200). The vulnerability description directly points to this impact without detailing the underlying cause.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description is very basic and states \"CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\". The key phrase also contains **impact:** Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor. This directly aligns with CWE-200.\n\nWhile CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE and the mapping guidance discourages its use, there is not enough information available to select a more specific Base or Variant level CWE. Given the limited information, I am confident that CWE-200 is the most appropriate choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product's intended functionality exposes information to certain actors in accordance with the developer's security policy, but this information is regarded as sensitive according to the intended security policies of other stakeholders such as the product's administrator, users, or others whose information is being processed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides an Applications Programming Interface (API) or similar interface for interaction with external actors, but the interface includes a dangerous method or function that is not properly restricted.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
