The vulnerability arises from the use of a regular expression `^(?\\\\s*now\\\\s*(?-\\\\s*(\\\\d+)\\\\s*([dmhs]))?)?\\\\s*$` to process user input. In Pythons default regex engine, this regular expression can take polynomial time to match certain crafted inputs. An attacker can exploit this by sending a crafted HTTP request, causing the gradio process to consume 100% CPU and potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition on the server. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-400 CWE-770 CWE-1287 CWE-674 CWE-185 CWE-617 CWE-941 CWE-1333",
