## Query
The Webico Slider Flatsome Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugins wbc_image shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes.

- **rootcause**: 'insufficient input sanitization', 'output escaping on user supplied attributes'
- **weakness**: 'cross-site scripting'
