## Vulnerability Description
Versions of the package spatie/browsershot before 5.0.1 are vulnerable to Improper Input Validation due to **improper URL validation** through the setUrl method. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by using leading whitespace (%20) before the file// protocol, resulting in **Local File Inclusion**, which allows the attacker to read sensitive files on the server.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper URL validation**
- **weakness:** **Local File Inclusion**
- **impact:** read sensitive files
- **vector:** leading whitespace before the file// protocol
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** spatie/browsershot
- **version:** before 5.0.1
- **component:** setUrl method

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper input validation within the `setUrl` method of the `spatie/browsershot` package. Specifically, the method fails to properly sanitize or validate URLs, allowing leading whitespace characters (specifically `%20`) before the `file://` protocol.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The `setUrl` method doesn't adequately check for and remove leading whitespace before processing the URL.
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** By exploiting the lack of proper validation, an attacker can inject a URL with leading whitespace followed by `file://` and a file path. This allows them to read sensitive files on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information such as configuration files, private keys, and other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the URL passed to the `setUrl` method by inserting leading whitespace before the `file://` protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No special privileges required:** The attacker does not need any specific privileges on the system to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to send a request containing the malicious URL to the affected server.
- **No user interaction is required:** The attack can be performed without any user interaction.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions prior to `5.0.1` of the `spatie/browsershot` package.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) is provided, demonstrating how to trigger the vulnerability.
- The fix involves trimming the URL before checking for the `file://` protocol, effectively preventing the LFI.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2024-21544.
- The CVSS score indicates a high severity vulnerability.
