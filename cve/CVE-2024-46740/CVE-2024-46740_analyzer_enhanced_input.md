## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved binder fix UAF caused by **offsets overwrite** Binder objects are processed and copied individually into the target buffer during transactions. Any raw data in-between these objects is copied as well. However, this raw data copy lacks an out-of-bounds check. If the raw data exceeds the data section size then the copy overwrites the offsets section. This eventually triggers an error that attempts to unwind the processed objects. However, at this point the offsets used to index these objects are now corrupted. Unwinding with corrupted offsets can result in decrements of arbitrary nodes and lead to their premature release. Other users of such nodes are left with a dangling pointer triggering a **use-after-free**. This issue is made evident by the following KASAN report (trimmed) ================================================================== BUG KASAN slab-**use-after-free** in _raw_spin_lock+0xe4/0x19c Write of size 4 at addr ffff47fc91598f04 by task binder-util/743 CPU 9 UID 0 PID 743 Comm binder-util Not tainted 6.11.0-rc4 #1 Hardware name linux,dummy-virt (DT) Call trace _raw_spin_lock+0xe4/0x19c binder_free_buf+0x128/0x434 binder_thread_write+0x8a4/0x3260 binder_ioctl+0x18f0/0x258c [...] Allocated by task 743 __kmalloc_cache_noprof+0x110/0x270 binder_new_node+0x50/0x700 binder_transaction+0x413c/0x6da8 binder_thread_write+0x978/0x3260 binder_ioctl+0x18f0/0x

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **offsets overwrite**
- **weakness:** **use-after-free**
- **impact:** arbitrary code execution
- **product:** Linux kernel

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A missing out-of-bounds check during the copy of raw data in binder transactions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** When copying raw data between binder objects during a transaction, the code fails to check if the size of the raw data exceeds the allocated data section. This allows a crafted transaction to overwrite the offsets section of the buffer.
- **Use-after-free (UAF):** Overwriting the offsets section corrupts the indices used to manage binder objects. When the transaction processing encounters an error and tries to unwind the processed objects using these corrupted offsets, it can lead to premature release of binder nodes.  Subsequent operations on these released nodes result in a use-after-free condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Use-after-free vulnerability:** An attacker can trigger a use-after-free condition, which may lead to:
    - **Denial of service:** Crashing the system.
    - **Arbitrary code execution:** If an attacker can control the memory region that is freed and subsequently used, this could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  A malicious binder transaction with oversized raw data can trigger the out-of-bounds write during the copying process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send binder transactions to the target system.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a binder transaction which includes raw data exceeding the allocated buffer size.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided KASAN report highlights a use-after-free vulnerability detected in the binder driver.
- The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the raw data copy remains within the boundaries of the allocated data section.
- The fix was backported to stable kernel branches.
