## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. Affected by this issue is the function AssimpLWOAnimResolverUpdateAnimRangeSetup of the file code/AssetLib/LWO/LWOAnimation.cpp of the component LWO File Handler. The manipulation leads to **heap-based buffer overflow**. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap-based buffer overflow**
- **product:** Open Asset Import Library Assimp
- **version:** 5.4.3
- **component:** AssimpLWOAnimResolverUpdateAnimRangeSetup of the file code/AssetLib/LWO/LWOAnimation.cpp of the component LWO File Handler

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content is related to a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the Assimp library, specifically within the `Assimp::LWO::AnimResolver::UpdateAnimRangeSetup` function, when processing LWO files. This aligns with the CVE-2025-3158 description.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the content:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in the `Assimp::LWO::AnimResolver::UpdateAnimRangeSetup` function. The code reads out-of-bounds variables, causing the overflow. Specifically, in `code/AssetLib/LWO/LWOAnimation.cpp:210`, `n` is reading out of bound variable than allocated `it (Assimp::LWO::Key)`, which caused heap buffer overflow.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) and out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Potential for remote code execution.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by tricking a victim into running Assimp on a malformed LWO file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious LWO file to a system that uses the vulnerable version of Assimp.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** Not explicitly provided, but the issue is labeled as a "Bug" and a pull request [#6222](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/pull/6222) is referenced, suggesting a fix is in development or has been implemented.
*   **More detail than the official CVE description:** Yes, the content provides specific details about the code lines where the vulnerability exists (code/AssetLib/LWO/LWOAnimation.cpp:210 and 213) and the structure where the overflow happens. It also includes a PoC and a sanitizer report.
