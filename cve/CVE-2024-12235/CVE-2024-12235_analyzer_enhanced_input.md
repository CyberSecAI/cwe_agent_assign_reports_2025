Affected by this vulnerability is the function doFilter of the file \agile-bpm-basic-master\ab-auth\ab-auth-spring-security-oauth2\src\main\java\com\dstz\auth\filter\AuthorizationTokenCheckFilter.java. The manipulation leads to **improper access controls**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper access controls**
- **product:** Shenzhen Dashi Tongzhou Information Technology AgileBPM
- **version:** up to 1.0.0
- **component:** doFilter in agile-bpm-basic-master/ab-auth/ab-auth-spring-security-oauth2/src/main/java/com/dstz/auth/filter/AuthorizationTokenCheckFilter.java

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Vertical Privilege Escalation

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `AuthorizationTokenCheckFilter.java` class within the AgileBPM application. The `doFilter` method only checks if a token is present and starts with "Bearer ", but it **does not validate the token's permission level or expiration status**. This lack of proper authorization checks allows an attacker to bypass security measures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insufficient Authorization Checks:** The core issue is the lack of verification of the token's permissions. The system trusts any validly formatted token, regardless of the user's actual role or rights.
*   **Missing Token Validation:** The filter doesn't validate the token's expiration, potentially allowing the use of old or compromised tokens.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with a regular user account can use their token to create new administrator accounts or modify existing user roles to gain administrative privileges. This enables complete control over the application.
*   **Data Breach:** With admin access, attackers can read, modify, or delete sensitive data within the application.
*   **System Compromise:** Full control of the application could lead to further system compromises and unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Interception:** Attackers can intercept network requests to obtain a valid token for a normal user account.
*   **API Manipulation:** Attackers can leverage the `api/ab-org/user/saveUserDto` API to create new user accounts with specific roles, including administrator.
*   **Direct API Access:** Using a captured token in subsequent requests allows access to privileged functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to the application:** The attacker needs to have an account within the vulnerable AgileBPM application to obtain a token.
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the application's API, which may be through a network or locally if the application is accessible on the local system.
*   **Knowledge of API endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the API endpoint to create a new user account and the parameters to send in the request.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in `agile-bpm-basic-master\ab-auth\ab-auth-spring-security-oauth2\src\main\java\com\dstz\auth\filter\AuthorizationTokenCheckFilter.java`
*   The vulnerable version is AgileBPM <= 1.0.0.
*   The provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates how to create an administrator account using an existing user's token. The `roleId` parameter is shown to be a fixed value, which simplifies the attack.
*   The fix recommendation is to add proper authorization authentication checks.
