# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-48214

## Description

KERUI HD 3MP 1080P Tuya Camera 1.0.4 has a **command injection** vulnerability in the module that connects to the local network via a QR code. This vulnerability allows an attacker to create a custom, unauthenticated QR code and abuse one of the parameters, either SSID or PASSWORD, in the JSON data contained within the QR code. By that, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the camera.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Weakness:** command injection
- **Impact:** execute arbitrary code
- **Vector:** custom unauthenticated QR code
- **Attacker:** attacker
- **Product:** KERUI HD 3MP 1080P Tuya Camera
- **Version:** 1.0.4
- **Component:** module connecting to local network via QR code

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Primary CWE | Allowed |
| CWE-77 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') | 0.7 | Class | Secondary Candidate | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis

The primary relationship influencing the CWE selection is the parent-child relationship between CWE-77 (Command Injection) and CWE-78 (OS Command Injection). Since the vulnerability specifically involves injecting commands into the operating system via the `system()` call, CWE-78, a Base level CWE, is more appropriate and specific than its parent, CWE-77, a Class level CWE.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of the SSID and password parameters from the QR code. This leads directly to **OS Command Injection**, which in turn results in arbitrary code execution on the camera.

Root Cause: **CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')**

Impact: Arbitrary Code Execution

## Summary of Analysis

The initial assessment identified **command injection** as the primary **weakness**, which aligns with both CWE-77 and CWE-78. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms that the `ssid` and `password` parameters extracted from a scanned QR code are used to construct a shell command for connecting to Wi-Fi using the `system()` function. The lack of sanitization allows injection of arbitrary commands, making CWE-78 the more specific and accurate classification.

The graph relationships further reinforce this decision. CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77, indicating that it is a more specific type of command injection that occurs at the OS level. The provided evidence clearly demonstrates that the injected commands are executed by the operating system, solidifying the choice of CWE-78.

The Retriever Results listed CWE-77 as the top combined result, however, CWE-78 was a close second and is at the Base level of abstraction. Given the specificity of the vulnerability description and the evidence from the CVE summary, CWE-78 is the more appropriate choice because it is at the Base level of abstraction and it involves OS commands.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
