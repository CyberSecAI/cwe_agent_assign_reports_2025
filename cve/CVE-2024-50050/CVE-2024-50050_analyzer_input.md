# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-50050

## Vulnerability Description
Llama Stack prior to revision 7a8aa775e5a267cf8660d83140011a0b7f91e005 used pickle as a serialization format for socket communication, potentially allowing for remote code execution. Socket communication has been changed to use JSON instead.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **use pickle as a serialization format for socket communication**
- **impact:** remote code execution
- **product:** Llama Stack
- **version:** prior to revision 7a8aa775e5a267cf8660d83140011a0b7f91e005

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Llama Stack used the `pickle` serialization format for socket communication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Using `pickle` for deserializing data from untrusted sources is dangerous because it allows arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution is possible.
- **Attack vectors:** Maliciously crafted `pickle` data sent over the socket connection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send crafted data to the vulnerable socket endpoint.
