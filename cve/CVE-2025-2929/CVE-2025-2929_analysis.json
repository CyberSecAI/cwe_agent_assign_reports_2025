It details a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Order Delivery Date Pro for WooCommerce plugin. Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nThe XSS could be used against high privilege users such as admins.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nAn attacker can craft a malicious URL and trick an administrator into clicking it. The provided Proof of Concept URL demonstrates this:\n\n`https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=orddd_order_calendar_content&order_id=43&event_value=a&event_type=order&event_timeslot=%3Cimg%20src%20onerror=alert(/XSS-event_timeslot/)%3E&event_date=%3Cimg%20src%20onerror=alert(/XSS-event_date/)%3E`\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Ability to craft a malicious URL.\n*   Ability to trick an administrator into clicking the URL. (Requires social engineering)\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 12.4.0 of the plugin.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-2929 is explicitly referenced.\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.1 (High)\n*   **Researcher:** Erwan LR (WPScan)\n*   **WPVDB ID:** e9299d8f-900b-4487-b135-b82946825e61\n*   **OWASP Top 10:** A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n*   **CWE:** CWE-79\n*   **Timeline:** Publicly Published: 2025-04-29, Added: 2025-04-29, Last Updated: 2025-04-29\n*   **Affected Plugin:** Order Delivery Date Pro for WooCommerce\n*   **Affected Versions:** < 12.4.0",
