  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-4936 Content\n\nThis content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it is a report of a vulnerability found in a specific application, and not a CVE record itself. It details a SQL injection vulnerability in \"Projectworlds Online Food Ordering System Project in PHP V1.0\". It provides more detail than a typical CVE description would.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   Insufficient user input validation of the '1\\_price' parameter in the `/admin-page.php` file. Malicious code injected into this parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering\n*   System control\n*   Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The `/admin-page.php` file is vulnerable.\n*   The '1\\_price' parameter (POST request) is the entry point for the attack.\n*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the `/admin-page.php` file. No authentication is required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:**  Separate SQL code from user input data.\n2.  **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.\n3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the minimum necessary permissions.\n4.  **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.\n\n**Payload Example:**\n\n```\nParameter: 1_price (POST)\n    Type: time-based blind\n    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)\n    Payload: 1_name=Item 1&1_price=25 AND (SELECT 5012 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))iBpZ)&1_hide=2&2_name=Item 2&2_price=45&2_hide=1&3_name=Item 3&3_price=20&3_hide=1&4_name=Item 4&4_price=15&4_hide=2&5_name=Item 5&5_price=20&5_hide=1&action=\n```\n\n**sqlmap command example:**\n\n```\nsqlmap -u \"http://192.168.238.80/Online-Food-Ordering-System-Project-in-PHP-master/admin-page.php\" --data=\"1_name=Item+1&1_price=25&1_hide=2&2_name=Item+2&2_price=45&2_hide=1&3_name=Item+3&3_price=20&3_hide=1&4_name=Item+4&4_price=15&4_hide=2&5_name=Item+5&5_price=20&5_hide=1&action=\" --dbs\n```",

The description clearly indicates **SQL injection** as the root cause, which aligns perfectly with CWE-89. Other CWEs were considered but deemed less relevant as they represent either broader categories or different types of vulnerabilities.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper neutralization of special elements** in the '1\\_price' parameter leading to CWE-89 (**SQL Injection**).\n2.  **Impact:** Unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, system control, and service interruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly points to a **SQL injection** vulnerability. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section explicitly mentions \"**sql injection**\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section further confirms this by stating that the root cause is \"Insufficient user input validation of the '1\\_price' parameter...Malicious code injected into this parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.\" This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-89.
