## Analysis of CVE-2025-4936 Content

This content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it is a report of a vulnerability found in a specific application, and not a CVE record itself. It details a SQL injection vulnerability in "Projectworlds Online Food Ordering System Project in PHP V1.0". It provides more detail than a typical CVE description would.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient user input validation of the '1\_price' parameter in the `/admin-page.php` file. Malicious code injected into this parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   System control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The `/admin-page.php` file is vulnerable.
*   The '1\_price' parameter (POST request) is the entry point for the attack.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the `/admin-page.php` file. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:**  Separate SQL code from user input data.
2.  **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.
3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the minimum necessary permissions.
4.  **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.

**Payload Example:**

```
Parameter: 1_price (POST)
    Type: time-based blind
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
    Payload: 1_name=Item 1&1_price=25 AND (SELECT 5012 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))iBpZ)&1_hide=2&2_name=Item 2&2_price=45&2_hide=1&3_name=Item 3&3_price=20&3_hide=1&4_name=Item 4&4_price=15&4_hide=2&5_name=Item 5&5_price=20&5_hide=1&action=
```

**sqlmap command example:**

```
sqlmap -u "http://192.168.238.80/Online-Food-Ordering-System-Project-in-PHP-master/admin-page.php" --data="1_name=Item+1&1_price=25&1_hide=2&2_name=Item+2&2_price=45&2_hide=1&3_name=Item+3&3_price=20&3_hide=1&4_name=Item+4&4_price=15&4_hide=2&5_name=Item+5&5_price=20&5_hide=1&action=" --dbs
