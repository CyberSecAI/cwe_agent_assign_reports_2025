## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mm use aligned address in copy_user_gigantic_page() In current kernel, hugetlb_wp() calls copy_user_large_folio() with the fault address. Where the fault address may be not aligned with the huge page size. Then, copy_user_large_folio() may call copy_user_gigantic_page() with the address, while copy_user_gigantic_page() requires the address to be huge page size aligned. So, this may cause **memory corruption** or information leak, addtional, use more obvious naming addr_hint instead of addr for copy_user_gigantic_page().

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **memory corruption**
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **impact:** information leak, memory corruption
