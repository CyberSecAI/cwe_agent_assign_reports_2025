  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mm use aligned address in copy_user_gigantic_page() In current kernel, hugetlb_wp() calls copy_user_large_folio() with the fault address. Where the fault address may be not aligned with the huge page size. Then, copy_user_large_folio() may call copy_user_gigantic_page() with the address, while copy_user_gigantic_page() requires the address to be huge page size aligned. So, this may cause **memory corruption** or information leak, addtional, use more obvious naming addr_hint instead of addr for copy_user_gigantic_page().",

This function expects a page-size-aligned address, and the misalignment leads to an **out-of-bounds write**, resulting in **memory corruption** or information leak.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is that `copy_user_gigantic_page()` receives a non-page-size-aligned address, leading to an out-of-bounds write. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions that the function requires the address to be huge page size aligned but it is not, causing **memory corruption**. The retriever results also ranked CWE-787 as the top candidate.\n\nRelevant evidence from the description:\n\"copy_user_gigantic_page() requires the address to be huge page size aligned.

The problem is with the address alignment.\n*   CWE-415 (Double Free): This is not related to the described vulnerability.\n*   CWE-1285 (Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input): The problem is not the validation of index/position/offset, but rather an alignment issue.\n*   CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound): No evidence of integer overflow.\n*   CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read): While possible as a consequence, the primary action is an out-of-bounds write.\n*   CWE-1260 (Improper Handling of Overlap Between Protected Memory Ranges): Not directly applicable; this is more about address alignment.\n*   CWE-123 (Write-what-where Condition): While this could be a consequence, it is less specific than CWE-787.\n# Summary\n| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the parent-child relationship.
