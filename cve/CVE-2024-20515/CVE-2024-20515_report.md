# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-20515

## Description

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to obtain sensitive information from an affected device. This vulnerability is due to a **lack of proper data protection mechanisms for certain configuration settings**. An attacker with Read-Only Administrator privileges could exploit this vulnerability by browsing to a page that contains sensitive data. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view device credentials that are normally not visible to Read-Only Administrators.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** lack of proper data protection mechanisms for certain configuration settings
- **Impact:** ['obtain sensitive information', 'view device credentials']
- **Vector:** browsing to a page that contains sensitive data

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-266 | Incorrect Privilege Assignment | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The **incorrect assignment of Read-Only Administrator privileges** allows access to sensitive data. |
| CWE-668 | Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. The sensitive data is exposed to an unauthorized control sphere (Read-Only Administrators). |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship impacting the decision is the privilege-related structure. CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) is a Base-level CWE that fits well because the root cause is a misconfigured privilege that allows Read-Only Administrators to access data they should not. CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) is considered a secondary CWE because the impact of the vulnerability results in resources being exposed to the wrong control sphere.

CWE-266 (Root Cause) -> CWE-668 (Impact)

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the "**lack of proper data protection mechanisms for certain configuration settings**" and the fact that "An attacker with Read-Only Administrator privileges could exploit this vulnerability". This strongly suggests a privilege management issue rather than a general access control problem.

The graph relationships influenced the final selection by clarifying the primary root cause (CWE-266) and the resulting impact (CWE-668).

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-266 accurately describes the **incorrect assignment of privileges**, while CWE-668 captures the broader impact of exposing resources to an unintended sphere of control.

**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
- **Chosen as the primary CWE due to the vulnerability description matching the CWE description.**

## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
