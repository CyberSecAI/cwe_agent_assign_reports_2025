It also details conditions for being affected or not affected.",

This choice is influenced by the vulnerability description indicating that the matcher should not be created if the endpoint is disabled or not exposed.\n\nThe secondary CWE candidate CWE-703, **Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions**, is a Pillar level CWE and is too high-level for this vulnerability. The root cause is more specific than a general failure to handle exceptional conditions, so this mapping is less preferred.\n\nCWE-668, **Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere**, is considered as a potential impact if the `/null` endpoint is not properly protected. However, this is a consequence rather than the direct cause of the vulnerability.

This leads to a potential exposure of resources to the wrong sphere (CWE-668) if the `/null` endpoint is not properly protected. The **improper null handling** (CWE-703) is an exceptional condition which is not handled.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability based on the provided evidence. The vulnerability description and CVE reference links highlight that the `EndpointRequest.to()` method creates an incorrect matcher when the actuator endpoint is disabled or not exposed.\n\nThe retriever results suggested several potential CWEs, including CWE-668, CWE-863, and CWE-917. However, after further analysis, CWE-696 was identified as the most appropriate primary CWE because it specifically addresses the **incorrect behavior order** leading to the vulnerability.\n\nThe relationship analysis helped refine the selection by highlighting the chain of events and the potential impact of the vulnerability. The final decision was influenced by the need to identify the root cause and map it to the most specific CWE available. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-696 at the Base level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
