  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2024-47092 related content\n\nThe provided content discusses Check\\_MK Python API packages and related tools (data2label, data2tag). The key finding is a commit message indicating a security improvement:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe commit message \"replaces eval() with ast.literal\\_eval()\" indicates that the code previously used `eval()`, which can execute arbitrary code if the input is not carefully controlled. This is a known security risk.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Use of `eval()`:** The original code used `eval()`, which is inherently dangerous when processing untrusted input. `eval()` allows execution of arbitrary Python code, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE) if an attacker can control the input to `eval()`.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If an attacker could control the input to the `eval()` function, they could execute arbitrary code on the server running the Check\\_MK API.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The attack vector depends on where the input to `eval()` comes from. Based on the code snippets, the input appears to come from configuration files (e.g., `args.config` in `data2label.py`). An attacker could potentially modify these configuration files to inject malicious code.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to modify configuration files accessible to the Check\\_MK API. This could require file system access or the ability to upload/modify configuration files through a vulnerable interface.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Replacing `eval()` with `ast.literal_eval()`:** The commit replaces `eval()` with `ast.literal_eval()`. `ast.literal_eval()` safely evaluates a string containing a Python literal (e.g., a string, number, list, dictionary) without executing arbitrary code. This significantly reduces the risk of RCE.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\nThe content provides more detail than the official CVE description would likely contain, specifically pinpointing the code change and the reason for it. The commit affects multiple files within the `check_mk_api`, `data2label`, and `data2tag` projects.",
