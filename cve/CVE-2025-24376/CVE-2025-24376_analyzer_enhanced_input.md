## Vulnerability Description
kubewarden-controller is a Kubernetes controller that allows you to dynamically register Kubewarden admission policies. By design, AdmissionPolicy and AdmissionPolicyGroup can evaluate only namespaced resources. The resources to be evaluated are determined by the rules provided by the user when defining the policy. There might be Kubernetes namespaced resources that should not be validated by AdmissionPolicy and by the AdmissionPolicyGroup policies because of their sensitive nature. For example, PolicyReport are namespaced resources that contain the list of non compliant objects found inside of a namespace. An attacker can use either an AdmissionPolicy or an AdmissionPolicyGroup to prevent the creation and update of PolicyReport objects to hide non-compliant resources. Moreover, the same attacker might use a mutating AdmissionPolicy to alter the contents of the PolicyReport created inside of the namespace. Starting from the 1.21.0 release, the validation rules applied to AdmissionPolicy and AdmissionPolicyGroup have been tightened to prevent them from validating sensitive types of namespaced resources.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** AdmissionPolicy and AdmissionPolicyGroup
- **product:** Kubewarden Admission Policies
- **impact:** prevent PolicyReport object creation and update, alter the contents of PolicyReport
- **attacker:** attacker

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-24376 based on provided content

The provided content is directly related to CVE-2025-24376 and provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description. Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

AdmissionPolicy and AdmissionPolicyGroup policies, by design, can evaluate namespaced resources based on user-defined rules. This allows potentially targeting sensitive resources like PolicyReport.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   An attacker can prevent the creation/update of PolicyReport objects, hiding non-compliant resources.
*   An attacker can alter the contents of PolicyReport objects.
*   The use of wildcards in `apiGroups` and `resources` rules for AdmissionPolicy and AdmissionPolicyGroup objects.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Hiding of non-compliant resources.
*   Manipulation of audit data (PolicyReports).
*   Reduced visibility into the security posture of the cluster.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Creation or modification of AdmissionPolicy or AdmissionPolicyGroup resources.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs the ability to create or modify AdmissionPolicy or AdmissionPolicyGroup resources within the Kubernetes cluster. No specific privileges are explicitly mentioned, implying a relatively low barrier to entry.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Patch:** Upgrade to kubewarden-controller version 1.21.0 or later.
*   **Workaround:** Apply the provided ClusterAdmissionPolicy to prevent the creation of AdmissionPolicy and AdmissionPolicyGroup resources that interact with PolicyReport resources (for versions < 1.21.0).

**Additional details:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 6.5 (Moderate)
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L
*   **Affected versions:** >= 1.7.0
*   **Patched versions:** 1.21.0
*   **No CWEs** are listed.
