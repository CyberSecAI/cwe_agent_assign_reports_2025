## Vulnerability Description
In Netgear WNR854T 1.5.2 (North America), the UPNP service is vulnerable to **command injection** in the function addmap_exec which parses the NewInternalClient parameter of the AddPortMapping SOAPAction into a system call without sanitation. An attacker can send a specially crafted SOAPAction request for AddPortMapping via the routers WANIPConn1 service to achieve arbitrary command execution.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper input sanitation**
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **impact:** arbitrary command execution
- **vector:** specially crafted SOAPAction request
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Netgear WNR854T
- **version:** 1.5.2 (North America)
- **component:** UPNP service

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
CVE-2024-54807

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an invalidated concatenation of the “NewInternalClient” provided in the request into an iptables command that is ultimately passed to system().

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Unauthenticated command execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
Sending a crafted M-SEARCH request with an oversized “NewInternalClient” value to the `/upnp/control/WANIPConnection1` control endpoint. The service is WAN-facing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
No authentication is required. The attacker can be on the WAN or LAN.

**Mitigation or fix:**
Not specified in the content.

**Additional details:**
The content provides more detail than the official CVE description, detailing the specific function and offset where the vulnerability exists, and providing a proof-of-concept payload. The content also notes that this is potentially the most critical vulnerability due to its wide attack surface, lack of authentication, and low exploit complexity.
