# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-3102

## Vulnerability Description
The SureTriggers All-in-One Automation Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to an **authentication bypass** leading to administrative account creation due to a **missing empty value check on the secret_key value in the autheticate_user function** in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.78. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create administrator accounts on the target website when the plugin is installed and activated but not configured with an API key.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **missing empty value check on the secret_key value in the autheticate_user function**
- **weakness:** **authentication bypass**
- **impact:** create administrator accounts
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **product:** SureTriggers All-in-One Automation Platform WordPress plugin
- **version:** all versions up to and including 1.0.78

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-3102 Content

Based on the provided content, this relates to a security vulnerability in the SureTriggers WordPress plugin.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the authentication mechanism within the `RestController.php` file. Specifically, the code previously used `true` in the `autheticate_user` function, which effectively bypassed authentication. This has been corrected to use `hash_equals` for secure comparison of the secret key.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient Authentication:** The original code lacked proper authentication, allowing potential unauthorized access.
*   **Insecure Comparison:** The previous use of `true` instead of a secure comparison function (like `hash_equals`) for the secret key was a critical flaw.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to bypass authentication and potentially gain unauthorized access to restricted functionality within the plugin.

**Attack vectors:**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending requests to the plugin's REST API endpoints without providing valid authentication credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site running the SureTriggers plugin.
*   No specific privileges are required to attempt the exploit.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The vulnerability was fixed by replacing `return true;` with `return hash_equals( $this->secret_key, $secret_key );` in the `autheticate_user` function. This ensures a secure comparison of the secret key, preventing unauthorized access. The fix is included in version 1.0.79 of the plugin.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The changelog explicitly mentions a security bug being addressed in version 1.0.79, with credit given to a researcher (mikemyers) for privately reporting it.
*   The code shows the specific line change that addresses the vulnerability.
*   The code also includes other changes related to API authentication and connection handling.
*   The code includes a function to verify the user token.
*   The code includes a function to test triggers.
*   The code includes a function to add connection info to debug information.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| No identity check (no login)                               | CWE-306        |
| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
