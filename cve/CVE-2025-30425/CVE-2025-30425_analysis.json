This directly aligns with CWE-664 (Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime). The vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary both explicitly mention **improved state management** as the fix, reinforcing this mapping.\n\nThe retriever results list several CWEs, with CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')) having the highest scores. However, these CWEs do not accurately reflect the **improper state management** aspect of the vulnerability. CWE-451 (User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information) is considered as a secondary candidate due to the potential impact of tracking users, which might involve some form of misrepresentation. However, the root cause is more directly related to **improper state management** than UI misrepresentation.\n\nThe selection of CWE-664 is at the Class level.
