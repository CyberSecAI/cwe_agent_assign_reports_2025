  "query": "A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in Shenzhen Sixun Software Sixun Shanghui Group Business Management System 7. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /WebPages/Adm/OperatorStop.asp of the component Reset Password Interface. The manipulation of the argument OperId leads to improper authorization. The attack may be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
