  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n*   **Root Cause:** The WordPress \"Google Plus Share and +1 Button\" plugin (versions <= 1.0) lacks proper protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.\n*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of CSRF protection. This means the plugin doesn't validate the origin of requests, making it susceptible to malicious manipulation.\n*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users (e.g. administrators) to perform unwanted actions within the WordPress site under their current authentication. The specific impact would vary depending on the actions the plugin allows a user to perform but may include altering site settings or content.\n*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a malicious link, image, or script that is crafted to perform actions on the vulnerable WordPress site via a request made in a victim\u2019s browser.  The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into visiting this malicious content or link.\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious request targeting the vulnerable plugin and then needs a higher-privileged user (e.g. admin) to interact with this malicious request while logged into the WordPress site. The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target WordPress site.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n* The vulnerability is classified as low priority and severity.\n* There is no official fix available at this time.\n* The vulnerability is associated with OWASP Top 10 A1: Broken Access Control.\n* The reported CVSS score for the vulnerability is 7.1",

The vulnerability then leads to Stored **XSS** (CWE-79) because the lack of CSRF protection allows for malicious input to be injected into the application.
