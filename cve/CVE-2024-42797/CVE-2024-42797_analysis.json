Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions **incorrect access control** and the attack is performed by an unauthenticated attacker, both authentication and authorization are relevant.

The description highlights \"**Incorrect Access Control**\" as the primary weakness. The retriever results also point to various authorization-related CWEs. Based on the vulnerability description, there is no authentication required to delete playlist entries. Therefore, the system **fails to authenticate** the user (CWE-306) and **fails to authorize** the action (CWE-862).\n\nThe CWEs selected are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-862 and CWE-306 are more precise than their parent CWEs (CWE-284 and CWE-285), providing a more accurate representation of the vulnerability. The decision is strongly based on the evidence from the vulnerability description, particularly the phrases \"**Incorrect Access Control**\" and \"unauthenticated attacker\".\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n**CWE-862: Missing Authorization**\nThe product does not perform any authorization checks for users attempting to access a resource.\n\n**CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function**\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n\nThe unauthenticated attacker can directly delete playlist entries because of the **missing authentication** and **missing authorization**.",
