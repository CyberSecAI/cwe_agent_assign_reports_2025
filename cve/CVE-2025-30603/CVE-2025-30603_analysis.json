The specific impact varies case by case.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nNot explicitly detailed, but inherent to CSRF - relies on tricking a logged-in user into performing an action on a web application.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nUnauthenticated.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\nNo official fix available. Patchstack offers \"vPatching\" as a mitigation.\n\n**Additional details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **CVSS Score:** 7.1 (Low severity)\n*   **Affected Software:** CopyLink WordPress Plugin\n*   **Vulnerable Versions:** <= 1.1\n*   **OWASP Top 10:** A1: Broken Access Control\n*   **Reported by:** Nabil Irawan\n*   **PSID:** f39adc1e834b\n*   The vulnerability is considered unlikely to be exploited due to its low severity.",

A successful CSRF attack can then lead to **CWE-79** Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') if the attacker injects malicious scripts via the forged request, which the application then renders without proper sanitization, leading to XSS.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **CWE-352** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), as stated in the vulnerability description: \"**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability in DEJAN CopyLink allows Stored XSS.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms the **root cause** is \"Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.\" **CWE-79** Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') is a secondary weakness because the CSRF vulnerability is used to inject malicious input that is not properly neutralized, leading to stored XSS.\n\nThe Retriever Results also show that **CWE-79** has a high score, which supports the assessment that Cross-site Scripting is involved.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description clearly points to CSRF as the initial **rootcause**, with XSS as a resulting vulnerability.
