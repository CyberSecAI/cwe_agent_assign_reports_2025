This is a base level CWE. A related CWE is CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion'), which is a class level CWE and a child of CWE-770. The relationship suggests that the excessive allocation of resources (CWE-770) directly leads to resource exhaustion (CWE-400), causing a denial-of-service.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')\"]\n    \n    cwe400 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **uncontrolled allocation of resources (CWE-770)**, which leads to **resource exhaustion (CWE-400)**, ultimately resulting in a denial-of-service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the vulnerability is due to **uncontrolled allocation of resources** in the InnoDB component of MySQL Server, which can lead to resource exhaustion and a denial-of-service. The primary evidence for this conclusion comes from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" that highlight the impact as a \"hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server\" and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which identifies the impact as having a \"High\" impact on availability\".\n\nCWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling is chosen as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The system allocates resources without proper limits, which allows an attacker to exhaust these resources. CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') is a consequence of CWE-770, and is included as a secondary CWE.\n\nThe evidence supports the selection of CWE-770 as the primary weakness, with CWE-400 as the result of this weakness.\n\nOther CWEs Considered and Rejected:\n\n*   CWE-NVD-noinfo: This is a placeholder CWE and not informative, so it was rejected.\n*   CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'): While SQL injection is a common vulnerability in database systems, the description doesn't indicate that this vulnerability is due to SQL injection.

This is a base level CWE. A related CWE is CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion'), which is a class level CWE and a child of CWE-770. The relationship suggests that the excessive allocation of resources (CWE-770) directly leads to resource exhaustion (CWE-400), causing a denial-of-service.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')\"]\n    \n    cwe400 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **uncontrolled allocation of resources (CWE-770)**, which leads to **resource exhaustion (CWE-400)**, ultimately resulting in a denial-of-service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the vulnerability is due to **uncontrolled allocation of resources** in the InnoDB component of MySQL Server, which can lead to resource exhaustion and a denial-of-service. The primary evidence for this conclusion comes from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" that highlight the impact as a \"hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server\" and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which identifies the impact as having a \"High\" impact on availability\".\n\nCWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling is chosen as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The system allocates resources without proper limits, which allows an attacker to exhaust these resources. CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') is a consequence of CWE-770, and is included as a secondary CWE.\n\nThe evidence supports the selection of CWE-770 as the primary weakness, with CWE-400 as the result of this weakness.\n\nOther CWEs Considered and Rejected:\n\n*   CWE-NVD-noinfo: This is a placeholder CWE and not informative, so it was rejected.\n*   CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'): While SQL injection is a common vulnerability in database systems, the description doesn't indicate that this vulnerability is due to SQL injection. Therefore, this CWE was not selected.\n*   CWE-129 Improper Validation of Array Index: This CWE is not applicable as the vulnerability doesn't involve array index validation issues.\n*   CWE-789 Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value: This is similar to CWE-770, but CWE-770 is a broader category that better fits the description.\n*   CWE-20 Improper Input Validation: This is a very broad CWE and doesn't capture the specific nature of the vulnerability, so it was not selected.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
