  "description": "Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to version 7.0.7, **missing initialization of the random seed for thash** leads to datasets having predictable hash table behavior. This can lead to dataset file loading to use excessive time to load, as well as runtime performance issues during traffic handling. This issue has been addressed in 7.0.7. As a workaround, avoid loading datasets from untrusted sources. Avoid dataset rules that track traffic in rules.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   The `util-thash.c` file in Suricata initializes a random factor for hash table creation, but this factor is never used. This results in predictable hash table behavior.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Predictable Hash Collisions:** Due to the lack of a random seed in the hash function, hash collisions are predictable.\n*   **Missing Random Seed:**  The core issue is the missing initialization of the random seed for the \"thash\" function used by datasets.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can craft datasets that cause excessive hash collisions. This leads to:\n    *   **Excessive Load Time:**  Dataset loading takes an unreasonable amount of time.\n    *   **Runtime Performance Issues:** Traffic handling performance degrades significantly during runtime.\n*   The vulnerability can be triggered by network traffic.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Malicious Datasets:** Attackers can craft malicious dataset files with predictable hash keys that exploit the lack of randomness in the hash function.\n*   **Network Traffic:**  The issue can be triggered by network traffic as the hash function is used during the processing.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Ability to provide malicious datasets:** An attacker needs to be able to provide malicious datasets to be loaded by Suricata, either through access to the filesystem or via configuration.\n*   **Network access:** Alternatively, the attacker can send network traffic that triggers this hash function.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n*   The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2024-47187 and also as GHSA-64ww-4f6x-863p.\n*   The issue is present in Suricata versions prior to 7.0.7 and was fixed in 7.0.7.\n*   The issue was also backported to the 7.0.x branch.\n*   The vulnerability is rated as CRITICAL with a CVSS score of 7.5.\n*   The weakness is categorized as CWE-330, which refers to the use of insufficiently random values.\n* The affected hash function is StringHashDjb2.",

The root cause is the **missing initialization of the random seed for thash**, leading to predictable behavior. |\n| CWE-407 | Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary candidate. The predictable hash table behavior leads to excessive time to load and runtime performance issues, indicating inefficient algorithmic complexity. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE, CWE-337, is a Variant of CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values). CWE-407, Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity, is a Class that describes the performance impact of the predictable hash collisions, but it's a consequence of the weak PRNG. The chain starts with the **missing random seed initialization**, leading to predictable hash collisions, and ultimately causing performance degradation, which aligns with CWE-407.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe337[\"CWE-337: Predictable Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)\"]\n    cwe330[\"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n\n    cwe337 -->|CHILDOF| cwe330\n    cwe337 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe407\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe337 primary\n    class cwe330,cwe407 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **missing initialization of the random seed for thash** (CWE-337), resulting in predictable hash table behavior. This predictability allows attackers to craft datasets that cause excessive hash collisions. The hash collisions then lead to excessive load times and runtime performance issues, which can be categorized as inefficient algorithmic complexity (CWE-407).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description, which clearly states the **missing initialization of the random seed**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by mentioning the \"missing random seed\" as the core issue. The retriever results point to related CWEs, particularly those dealing with weak randomness and algorithmic complexity. The selection of CWE-337 is based on the root cause explanation and the specific detail of the PRNG seed. CWE-407 is a secondary consideration as it captures the performance impact.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-337 is a child of CWE-330, which is a more general class. However, CWE-337 is more specific to the use of a predictable seed, which is the core issue described in the vulnerability. Therefore, CWE-337 is at the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
