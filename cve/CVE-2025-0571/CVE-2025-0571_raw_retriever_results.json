  "query": "Sante PACS Server Web Portal DCM File Parsing Memory Corruption Denial-of-Service Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to create a denial-of-service condition on affected installations of Sante PACS Server. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DCM files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory corruption condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to create a denial-of-service condition on the system. Was ZDI-CAN-25305.",
