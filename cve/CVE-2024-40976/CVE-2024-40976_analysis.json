  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/lima mask irqs in timeout path before hard reset There is a **race condition** in which a rendering job might take just long enough to trigger the drm sched job timeout handler but also still complete before the hard reset is done by the timeout handler. This runs into **race condition**s not expected by the timeout handler. In some very specific cases it currently may result in a refcount imbalance on lima_pm_idle, with a stack dump such as [10136.669170] WARNING CPU 0 PID 0 at drivers/gpu/drm/lima/lima_devfreq.c205 lima_devfreq_record_idle+0xa0/0xb0 ...

The irqs will be enabled again at the next hard reset which is already done as a recovery by the timeout handler.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commits:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nA race condition exists in the Lima DRM driver's scheduler. A rendering job could take just enough time to trigger the timeout handler, but also complete before the hard reset initiated by the same handler. This leads to unexpected race conditions within the timeout handler.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Race Condition:** The core issue is a race condition between the job completion and the timeout handler's actions. Specifically, the timeout handler doesn't properly account for the possibility of the job finishing concurrently with the handler's execution.\n- **Refcount Imbalance:** In certain scenarios, this race condition results in a refcount imbalance on `lima_pm_idle`. This suggests a resource management issue where a resource is released or acquired at the wrong time.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **System Instability:** The immediate impact is a refcount imbalance and a stack dump, indicating the system enters an inconsistent state.\n- **Potential for Further Issues:** While not explicitly stated, a refcount imbalance can lead to memory corruption or other unpredictable behavior if left unaddressed.\n- **Denial of Service:** The stack dump could lead to a crash, thus denying service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Triggering Long-Running Jobs:** An attacker could trigger rendering jobs that are carefully timed to create the race condition.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Ability to submit rendering jobs:** The attacker must have the ability to submit rendering jobs to the GPU via the Lima DRM driver. This typically implies a user-space process capable of interacting with the graphics subsystem.\n\n**Mitigation:**\nThe fix is to mask all IRQs at the beginning of the timeout handler. This prevents the job from completing while the handler is running. The IRQs are re-enabled later by the hard reset done by the timeout handler, thus not breaking normal operation.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The patch adds a call to `pipe->task_mask_irq(pipe)` at the beginning of the `lima_sched_timedout_job` function, which masks the relevant interrupts to avoid the race condition.\n- The provided stack trace highlights the specific call sequence that leads to the refcount issue.\n- This issue was fixed in multiple stable kernel branches.",

Several related CWEs were considered, including CWE-367, CWE-364, and CWE-667. CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use) is a Base CWE and a child of CWE-362, but the description doesn't provide sufficient detail to confirm that a TOCTOU condition exists, so CWE-362 is the more appropriate choice. CWE-667 (Improper Locking) is also a Class-level CWE that could be related, as the root cause might stem from improper locking mechanisms.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n\n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    cwe667 -->|PEEROF| cwe362\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe667,cwe367 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with concurrent execution without proper synchronization, leading to a **race condition**. This can then lead to a refcount imbalance, and ultimately a system crash/denial of service.\n\nConcurrent Execution (CWE-362) -> **Race Condition** -> Refcount Imbalance -> Denial of Service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified a **race condition** in the Linux kernel's DRM lima driver, specifically when a rendering job completes concurrently with the timeout handler's actions. The primary CWE selected is CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('**Race Condition**')), because the vulnerability description mentions a **race condition** directly, and the fix involves masking IRQs to prevent the **race condition**.\n\nThe evidence supporting CWE-362 comes from the following:\n- \"There is a **race condition** in which a rendering job might take just long enough to trigger the drm sched job timeout handler but also still complete before the hard reset is done by the timeout handler. This runs into **race condition**s not expected by the timeout handler.\"\n- \"We can prevent that **race condition** entirely by masking the irqs at the beginning of the timeout handler, at which point we give up on waiting for that job entirely.\"\n\nThe other CWEs were considered as follows:\n- CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) **Race Condition**): While a TOCTOU **race condition** is possible, the provided details do not explicitly confirm it. Therefore, a more general CWE is more appropriate.\n- CWE-667 (Improper Locking): While masking IRQs is a potential fix, the problem stems from concurrent execution with shared resources, making CWE-362 a better fit.\n\nThe selection of CWE-362 is at the Class level because more specific information regarding the type of **race condition** is lacking. If there was a TOCTOU condition, then CWE-367 would be preferred.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\nCWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('**Race Condition**')\n**Technical Explanation**: The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n**Security Implications**: This can lead to data corruption, system instability, or denial of service. In this case, the **race condition** leads to a refcount imbalance and stack dump.\n**Relationship**: CWE-362 is a Class-level CWE.\n**Mapping Guidance Influence**: The Mapping Guidance suggests using Base-level children where possible, but in this case, the description doesn't provide sufficient information for a more specific CWE.\n**Usage**: Allowed-with-Review\n\nCWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Technical Explanation**: The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n**Security Implications**: Improper locking can lead to **race condition**s, data corruption, and denial of service.\n**Relationship**: CWE-609 Double-Checked Locking is a child of CWE-667.\n**Mapping Guidance Influence**: The Mapping Guidance suggests using Base-level children where possible.\n**Usage**: Allowed-with-Review\n\nCWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) **Race Condition**\n**Technical Explanation**: The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.\n**Security Implications**: Can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.\n**Relationship**: CWE-367 is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-362.\n**Mapping Guidance Influence**: The Mapping Guidance suggests using this CWE if a TOCTOU condition is present.\n**Usage**: Allowed",
