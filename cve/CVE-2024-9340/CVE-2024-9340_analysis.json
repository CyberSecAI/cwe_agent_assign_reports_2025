  "description": "A **Denial of Service** (DoS) vulnerability in zenml-io/zenml version 0.66.0 allows unauthenticated attackers to cause excessive resource consumption by sending malformed multipart requests with arbitrary characters appended to the end of multipart boundaries. This flaw in the multipart request boundary processing mechanism leads to an **infinite loop**, resulting in a complete denial of service for all users. Affected endpoints include `/api/v1/login` and `/api/v1/device_authorization`.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2024-9340 Content\n\nThe provided content relates to a fix for preventing excessively large requests to the ZenML server. It addresses potential denial-of-service vulnerabilities by limiting the request body size and restricting file uploads to specific endpoints.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe ZenML server was susceptible to denial-of-service attacks due to the acceptance of arbitrarily large requests and unrestricted file uploads.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** Accepting large request bodies could exhaust server resources (memory, processing power), leading to a denial of service.\n*   **Unrestricted File Uploads:** Allowing file uploads to any endpoint could be exploited to upload malicious files or consume excessive storage space.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could send a large request, causing the server to become unresponsive or crash.\n*   **Resource Exhaustion:**  Excessive resource consumption could impact the availability of the ZenML server for legitimate users.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Network:** An attacker could send a crafted HTTP request with a large body size over the network.\n*   **HTTP POST requests:** An attacker could send a POST request with a large file attached.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the ZenML server.\n*   **HTTP Client:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Request Body Size Limit:** Implemented a `RequestBodyLimit` middleware to limit the maximum size of the request body to a configurable value (defaulting to 256KB).\n*   **File Upload Restriction:** Implemented a `RestrictFileUploadsMiddleware` to restrict file uploads to specific allowed paths.\n*   **Configuration:** Added `max_request_body_size_in_bytes` to the `ServerConfiguration` class to allow administrators to configure the maximum request body size.\n\n**More detail than official CVE description:**\n\nYes, the content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It includes specific code changes, middleware implementations, and configuration options related to the fix. It also explains the reasoning behind the changes and the potential impact of the vulnerabilities.",

The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an **infinite loop** due to malformed multipart requests.|\n| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. The CVE summary states that the root cause is **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** due to accepting large request bodies. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-835, which describes the **infinite loop** condition. This leads to CWE-400, **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**, as the loop consumes resources indefinitely. While CWE-400 is a Class-level CWE and generally discouraged, the CVE summary explicitly mentions **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** as a root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe835[\"CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe835 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe835 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **infinite loop** (CWE-835) caused by the **improper handling of malformed multipart requests**. This **infinite loop** then leads to **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400), resulting in a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **infinite loop** as the primary weakness, leading to **uncontrolled resource consumption**. The CVE summary confirms the **uncontrolled resource consumption** aspect as a root cause. The relationship graph illustrates how the **infinite loop** can lead to **uncontrolled resource consumption**. The selection of CWE-835 is based on the explicit mention of the **infinite loop** in the vulnerability description. CWE-400 is added as a secondary CWE because the CVE Summary explicitly mentions the root cause of **uncontrolled resource consumption**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an iteration or loop with an exit condition that cannot be reached, i.e., an infinite loop.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs.
