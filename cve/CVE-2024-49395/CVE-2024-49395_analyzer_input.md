# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-49395

## Vulnerability Description
In mutt and neomutt, **PGP encryption does not use the --hidden-recipient mode** which may leak the Bcc email header field by inferring from the recipients info.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **PGP encryption does not use the --hidden-recipient mode**
- **impact:** leak the Bcc email header field
- **vector:** inferring from the recipients info
- **product:** mutt and neomutt
- **component:** PGP encryption

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the fact that PGP encryption in `mutt` and `neomutt` does not use the `--hidden-recipient` mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Bcc Leakage:** The primary weakness is that the Bcc (Blind Carbon Copy) email header field can be indirectly leaked.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can infer the recipients listed in the Bcc field by analyzing the cryptographic information block of the encrypted email. This information would otherwise be hidden from the other recipients.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves sending an encrypted email with Bcc recipients using `mutt` or `neomutt`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to intercept or access the encrypted email to analyze its cryptographic information. The attacker does not need to be a recipient of the message or otherwise have direct access to the email account.
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to analyze cryptographic information from the email.

**Additional Notes**

* The provided content references the specific CVE (CVE-2024-49395) and clearly links it to the issue of Bcc header leakage in `mutt` and `neomutt` due to the lack of `--hidden-recipient` mode.
