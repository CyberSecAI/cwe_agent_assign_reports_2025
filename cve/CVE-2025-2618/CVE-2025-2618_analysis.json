  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in D-Link DAP-1620 1.03. Affected by this issue is the function set_ws_action of the file /dws/api/ of the component Path Handler. The manipulation leads to **heap-based buffer overflow**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.",
