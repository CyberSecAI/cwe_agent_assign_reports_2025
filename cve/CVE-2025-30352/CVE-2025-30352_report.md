# Analysis Report for CVE-2025-30352

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-30352

## Description

Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0-alpha.4 and prior to version 11.5.0, the `search` query parameter allows users with access to a collection to filter items based on fields they do not have permission to view. This allows the enumeration of unknown field contents. The searchable columns (numbers & strings) are not checked against permissions when injecting the `where` clauses for applying the search query. This leads to the possibility of enumerating those un-permitted fields. Version 11.5.0 fixes the issue.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** searchable columns not checked against permissions
- **Weakness:** un-permitted fields enumeration
- **Impact:** enumerating un-permitted fields
- **Attacker:** users with access to a collection
- **Product:** Directus
- **Version:** 9.0.0-alpha.4 to 11.5.0

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the hierarchical relationship between CWE-863 and its potential children. While the description points towards an authorization issue, the evidence available does not pinpoint the exact flaw in the authorization logic, making the class-level CWE-863 the most appropriate choice. CWE-200 is a potential impact, but its relationship to CWE-863 is not direct.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **searchable columns not being checked against permissions**, leading to **incorrect authorization**, and ultimately resulting in the **enumeration of un-permitted fields** and **exposure of sensitive information**.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The provided evidence, particularly the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" and "CVE Reference Links Content Summary," clearly points to an authorization issue where **searchable columns are not checked against permissions**.

CWE-863 aligns well with this description, as it represents a scenario where the product performs an authorization check, but the check is performed incorrectly. The description states that users can access and filter items based on fields they do not have permission to view, which falls under the umbrella of incorrect authorization.

The retriever results also suggest CWE-863 as a strong candidate, further supporting its selection.

CWE-200 is included as a secondary CWE because the ultimate impact is the **exposure of sensitive information**.

The selection of CWE-863 is at the class level because the specifics of the incorrect authorization check are not detailed enough to warrant a more specific base-level CWE.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges 
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.

## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.
