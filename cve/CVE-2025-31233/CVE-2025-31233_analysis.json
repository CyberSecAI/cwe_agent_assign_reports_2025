The **maliciously crafted video file** leads to memory corruption by writing past the allocated buffer. |\n| CWE-119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | 0.5 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability involves operations outside the intended buffer. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-787, which is a base-level CWE. CWE-119 is a parent Class of CWE-787. CWE-119 is too general, and CWE-787 is a more specific representation of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **maliciously crafted video file** which is processed by the CoreMedia component. This leads to an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787), resulting in **corrupt process memory** and potentially **unexpected app termination**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which includes the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The key phrase \"processing a **maliciously crafted video file** may lead to unexpected app termination or **corrupt process memory**\" strongly suggests a memory corruption issue. The description also mentions the issue was addressed with improved input sanitization.\n\nCWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is the most appropriate primary CWE because it accurately describes the root cause of the vulnerability, where a **maliciously crafted video file** leads to memory corruption by writing past the allocated buffer. This is supported by the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which indicates the **issue was addressed with improved input sanitization**.\n\nCWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) was considered as a secondary CWE because it is a broader category that includes out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities. However, CWE-787 is more specific and therefore more appropriate as the primary CWE.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-787 being a Base-level CWE that directly addresses the **out-of-bounds write** condition.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')): While memory corruption is possible, there is no explicit mention of type confusion.\n*   CWE-665 (Improper Initialization): There's no mention of initialization issues in the description.\n*   CWE-415 (Double Free): There's no mention of double free in the description.\n*   CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation): While improved input sanitization addresses the vulnerability, CWE-20 is too high-level and doesn't pinpoint the specific weakness.\n* CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read: The impact focuses on memory corruption which hints to a write as opposed to read.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
