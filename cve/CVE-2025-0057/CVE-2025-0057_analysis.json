CWE-434, **Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type**, can lead to CWE-79 if the uploaded file contains malicious scripts. CWE-862, **Missing Authorization**, might allow the attacker to upload the malicious file in the first place.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe434 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n    cwe862 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe434\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe434,cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n1.  **Missing Authorization** (CWE-862): Attacker gains privileges they shouldn't have.\n2.  **Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type** (CWE-434): Attacker uploads a malicious file (photo with JS content).\n3.  **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')** (CWE-79): The application fails to neutralize the malicious script in the uploaded file.\n4.  **Impact:** When a victim visits the vulnerable component, the attacker can read and modify information within the scope of victim's web browser.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is primarily a stored **cross-site scripting** issue, as explicitly stated in the description.
