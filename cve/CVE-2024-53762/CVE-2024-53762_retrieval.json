Specific impacts vary on a case-by-case basis but could include modification of appointment booking settings, user data manipulation, or other administrative tasks.\\n- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious request that is sent to the vulnerable website and triggered by a logged-in user.\\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to click on a malicious link or open a malicious page, which executes the crafted request.
