The evidence is strong as the vulnerability description and CVE summary both use the term \"buffer over-read\". The retriever results also list CWE-126 as the top candidate.\nCWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) was considered but not selected as the primary CWE because it's a more general class and the description is specific enough to use the variant CWE-126. While CWE-119 can be related, it is discouraged from use.\nCWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) was considered as it's similar to CWE-126, but \"over-read\" suggests reading beyond the intended buffer, making CWE-126 the better fit.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary.
