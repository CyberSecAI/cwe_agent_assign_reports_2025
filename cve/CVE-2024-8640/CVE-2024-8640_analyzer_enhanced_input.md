## Vulnerability Description
An issue has been discovered in GitLab EE affecting all versions starting from 16.11 prior to 17.1.7, from 17.2 prior to 17.2.5, and from 17.3 prior to 17.3.2. Due to **incomplete input filtering**, it was possible to inject commands into a connected Cube server.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **incomplete input filtering**
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **product:** GitLab EE
- **version:** all versions starting from 16.11 prior to 17.1.7, from 17.2 prior to 17.2.5, and from 17.3 prior to 17.3.2

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-8640:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input within the `seconds_to_convert` parameter when creating funnel dashboards in GitLab's Product Analytics feature. This parameter is directly embedded into a SQL query executed by the Cube server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Code Injection:** The primary vulnerability is code injection. The `seconds_to_convert` parameter, intended to be a numerical value, is not validated or sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code within the `${}` syntax, which is then executed by the Cube server.
- **SQL Injection**: The injected string is used in a SQL query, which could lead to SQL injection in the ClickHouse DB that Cube uses, however the described RCE is the more impactful vulnerability

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The injected JavaScript code is executed within the Cube server's Node.js environment with root privileges. This allows a remote attacker to gain complete control over the Cube instance.
- **Reverse Shell:**  The provided exploit code demonstrates establishing a reverse shell back to the attacker, granting them the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the compromised server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Product Analytics Feature:** The attack vector is through the Product Analytics feature's funnel dashboard configuration.
- **YAML Configuration:** The malicious payload is injected via a crafted YAML file that defines the funnel dashboard. Specifically in the `seconds_to_convert` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **GitLab Account:** The attacker needs a GitLab account with the ability to create projects.
- **Ultimate License (or Trial):** The attacker needs a GitLab group with an Ultimate license, or can use a trial for testing
- **Project Access:** The attacker needs to be able to create a project within the licensed group.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to receive a reverse shell connection on a server they control.
- **Basic Knowledge of Gitlab and Product analytics:** The attacker needs to be able to navigate to the correct screens, enable the feature and create the vulnerable YAML file.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects GitLab EE.
- The vulnerability was reported through GitLab's HackerOne bug bounty program.
- The issue has been fixed in versions 17.1.7, 17.2.5, and 17.3.2.
- The provided information is more descriptive and detailed than the CVE description placeholder.
