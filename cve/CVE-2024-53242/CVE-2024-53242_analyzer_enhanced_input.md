## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability has been identified in Teamcenter Visualization V14.2 (All versions < V14.2.0.14), Teamcenter Visualization V14.3 (All versions < V14.3.0.12), Teamcenter Visualization V2312 (All versions < V2312.0008), Tecnomatix Plant Simulation V2302 (All versions < V2302.0016), Tecnomatix Plant Simulation V2404 (All versions < V2404.0005). The affected applications contain an **out of bounds read past the end of an allocated structure** while parsing specially crafted WRL files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process. (ZDI-CAN-25206)
