The system performs an authorization check, but the check is performed incorrectly. |\n| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. Sensitive information about archived channels, such as post and file information, is exposed to an unauthorized actor due to the authorization failure. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-863, which represents the **incorrect authorization**. CWE-863 is a Class-level CWE, and while more specific Base-level children might exist, the provided information doesn't specify the exact mechanism of the authorization failure, making CWE-863 the most appropriate choice. CWE-200 is a consequence of the authorization failure, where sensitive information is exposed. CWE-200 is discouraged as a primary mapping because it describes the impact (information exposure) rather than the root cause (**incorrect authorization**).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe200 -->|RESULTED_FROM| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect authorization (CWE-863)**, which leads to the **exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200)**. The root cause is the **failure to properly authorize requests when viewing archived channels is disabled**, and the impact is the retrieval of post and file information about archived channels by an attacker.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several potential CWEs, but based on the vulnerability description, the **root cause** is the **failure to properly authorize requests**. This aligns best with CWE-863 (**Incorrect Authorization**). The vulnerability description explicitly states that the system \"fail[s] to properly authorize requests,\" directly supporting the choice of CWE-863. The retriever results also list CWE-863 as the top candidate. The exposure of post and file information is a consequence of this authorization failure, making CWE-200 (**Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**) a secondary concern. The choice of CWE-863 over its parent CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**) is due to the more specific nature of CWE-863, which indicates that an authorization check is performed but incorrectly, rather than not performed at all. The evidence supporting this is the phrase \"**fail to properly authorize requests**\".\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially
