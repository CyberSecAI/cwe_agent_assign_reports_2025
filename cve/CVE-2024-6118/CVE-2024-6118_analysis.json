Since the passwords were stored in plaintext (as opposed to some other form of insufficiently protected credential), CWE-256 was chosen because it is the more specific, base-level weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe256 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe312\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe312 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of weaknesses starts with the **plaintext storage of passwords** (CWE-256). This leads to the disclosure of credentials, allowing remote attackers to gain unauthorized access to the product.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **plaintext storage of passwords**, as stated in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The selection of CWE-256 is based on the explicit mention of \"plaintext storage of passwords\" as the root cause. CWE-256 is a base-level CWE, which is the preferred level of abstraction.
