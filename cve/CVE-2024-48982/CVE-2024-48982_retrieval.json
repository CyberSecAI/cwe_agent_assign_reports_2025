  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-48982', description='An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0. Its hci parsing software dynamically determines the length of certain hci packets by reading a byte from its header. This value is assumed to be greater than or equal to 3, but the software doesnt ensure that this is the case. Supplying a length less than 3 leads to a **buffer overflow** in a buffer that is allocated later. It is simultaneously possible to cause another **integer overflow** by supplying large length values because the provided length value is increased by a few bytes to account for additional information that is supposed to be stored there. This bug is trivial to exploit for a denial of service but is not certain to suffice to bring the system down and can generally not be exploited further because the exploitable buffer is dynamically allocated.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'doesnt ensure the length of certain hci packets is greater than or equal to 3', 'weakness': ['buffer overflow', 'integer overflow'], 'impact': 'denial of service', 'vector': 'supplying a length less than 3', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'MBed OS', 'version': '6.16.0', 'component': 'hci parsing software'}, reference_content='The provided content relates to CVE-2024-48982.\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\nInteger overflows in `hciEvtProcessCmdCmpl` when calculating the size of the buffer to allocate for an incoming HCI command packet.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**\\n1.  **Integer Underflow:** When the length of the packet body (`len`) is less than 3, subtracting 3 from it results in an underflow when `remainingLen` is calculated as `len - 3`. This leads to a very large value for `remainingLen` when it is stored as an 8-bit integer.\\n2.  **Integer Overflow:**  The size of the message buffer (`msgSize`) is calculated by adding `remainingLen` to the size of a structure (`structSize`), both stored as 8-bit integers. When the sum exceeds the maximum value of a `uint8_t`, it results in a small `msgSize`, while the `memcpy` copies `remainingLen` bytes to this buffer, causing a buffer overflow.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\nA buffer overflow occurs when `memcpy` copies data into the allocated buffer. This can lead to memory corruption, potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory regions and execute arbitrary code.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\nAn attacker can craft a malicious HCI command packet with a carefully chosen length field.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\nThe attacker needs to be able to send malicious HCI command packets to the vulnerable system.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '1284', 'name': 'Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:doesnt ensure the length of certain hci packets is greater than or equal to 3', 'keyphrase': 'doesnt ensure the length of certain hci packets is greater than or equal to 3', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:buffer overflow', 'keyphrase': 'buffer overflow', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:integer overflow', 'keyphrase': 'integer overflow', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:denial of service', 'keyphrase': 'denial of service', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'vector:supplying a length less than 3', 'keyphrase': 'supplying a length less than 3', 'type': 'vector'}, {'id': 'product:MBed OS', 'keyphrase': 'MBed OS', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:6.16.0', 'keyphrase': '6.16.0', 'type': 'version'}, {'id': 'component:hci parsing software', 'keyphrase': 'hci parsing software', 'type': 'component'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(1120.5215354135753)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '789', 'name': 'Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:doesnt ensure the length of certain hci packets is greater than or equal to 3', 'keyphrase': 'doesnt ensure the length of certain hci packets is greater than or equal to 3', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:buffer overflow', 'keyphrase': 'buffer overflow', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:integer overflow', 'keyphrase': 'integer overflow', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:denial of service', 'keyphrase': 'denial of service', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'vector:supplying a length less than 3', 'keyphrase': 'supplying a length less than 3', 'type': 'vector'}, {'id': 'product:MBed OS', 'keyphrase': 'MBed OS', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:6.16.0', 'keyphrase': '6.16.0', 'type': 'version'}, {'id': 'component:hci parsing software', 'keyphrase': 'hci parsing software', 'type': 'component'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(1064.45254029468)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '130', 'name': 'Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:doesnt ensure the length of certain hci packets is greater than or equal to 3', 'keyphrase': 'doesnt ensure the length of certain hci packets is greater than or equal to 3', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:buffer overflow', 'keyphrase': 'buffer overflow', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:denial of service', 'keyphrase': 'denial of service', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'vector:supplying a length less than 3', 'keyphrase': 'supplying a length less than 3', 'type': 'vector'}, {'id': 'version:6.16.0', 'keyphrase': '6.16.0', 'type': 'version'}, {'id': 'component:hci parsing software', 'keyphrase': 'hci parsing software', 'type': 'component'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(1051.817479932439)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '190', 'name': 'Integer Overflow or Wraparound', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product performs a calculation that can\\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\\n         the original value.

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0. Its hci parsing software dynamically determines the length of certain hci packets by reading a byte from its header. This value is assumed to be greater than or equal to 3, but the software doesnt ensure that this is the case. Supplying a length less than 3 leads to a **buffer overflow** in a buffer that is allocated later. It is simultaneously possible to cause another **integer overflow** by supplying large length values because the provided length value is increased by a few bytes to account for additional information that is supposed to be stored there. This bug is trivial to exploit for a denial of service but is not certain to suffice to bring the system down and can generally not be exploited further because the exploitable buffer is dynamically allocated.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'doesnt ensure the length of certain hci packets is greater than or equal to 3'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
