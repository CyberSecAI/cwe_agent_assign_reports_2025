  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi mt76 mt7921s fix potential hung tasks during chip recovery During chip recovery (e.g. chip reset), there is a possible situation that kernel worker reset_work is holding the lock and waiting for kernel thread stat_worker to be parked, while stat_worker is waiting for the release of the same lock. It causes a deadlock resulting in the dumping of hung tasks messages and possible rebooting of the device. This patch prevents the execution of stat_worker during the chip recovery.",
