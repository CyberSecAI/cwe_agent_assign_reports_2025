  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-5278', description='gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt is vulnerable to an ****unrestricted file upload**** vulnerability due to **insufficient validation of uploaded file types** in its `/upload` endpoint. Specifically, the `handle_file_upload` function does not sanitize or validate the file extension or content type of uploaded files, allowing attackers to upload files with arbitrary extensions, including HTML files containing **XSS** payloads and Python files. This vulnerability, present in the latest version as of 20240310, could lead to stored **XSS** attacks and potentially result in remote code execution (RCE) on the server hosting the application.',

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt is vulnerable to an ****unrestricted file upload**** vulnerability due to **insufficient validation of uploaded file types** in its `/upload` endpoint. Specifically, the `handle_file_upload` function does not sanitize or validate the file extension or content type of uploaded files, allowing attackers to upload files with arbitrary extensions, including HTML files containing **XSS** payloads and Python files. This vulnerability, present in the latest version as of 20240310, could lead to stored **XSS** attacks and potentially result in remote code execution (RCE) on the server hosting the application.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'insufficient validation of uploaded file types'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
