  "query": "Altair is a fork of Misskey v12. Affected versions lack of request validation and lack of authentication in the image proxy for compressing and resizing remote files could allow attacks that could affect availability, such as by abnormally increasing the CPU usage of the server on which this software is running or placing a heavy load on the network it is using. This issue has been fixed in v12.24Q4.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
