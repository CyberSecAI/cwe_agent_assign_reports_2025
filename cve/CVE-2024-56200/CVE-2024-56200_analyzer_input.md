# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-56200

## Vulnerability Description
Altair is a fork of Misskey v12. Affected versions **lack of request validation and lack of authentication in the image proxy** for compressing and resizing remote files could allow attacks that could affect availability, such as by abnormally increasing the CPU usage of the server on which this software is running or placing a heavy load on the network it is using. This issue has been fixed in v12.24Q4.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **lack of request validation and lack of authentication in the image proxy**
- **impact:** abnormally increasing the CPU usage and heavy load on the network and affect availability
- **product:** Altair

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of request validation and missing authentication in the media/file proxy, specifically when handling remote files for compression and resizing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Uncontrolled Recursion**: The description mentions "Uncontrolled Recursion" as part of the title of the security advisory.
- **Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification)**: The vulnerability leads to an amplification effect, as it allows attackers to consume excessive resources on the server.
- **Missing Request Validation:** There is insufficient validation of requests made to the media/file proxy.
- **Missing Authentication:**  The proxy does not require proper authentication, allowing unauthenticated access to its functionalities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause abnormal increases in CPU usage on the server and generate significant load on the network.
- **Availability Impact:** The attacks can impact the availability of the service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network**: The vulnerability is exploitable via network requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **No privileges required:** The attacker does not need any prior privileges or user accounts to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No user interaction required:** The attack can be performed without any user interaction.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is similar to one found in the upstream project ([https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-gq5q-c77c-v23600](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-gq5q-c77c-v23600)).
- The fix was implemented in commit `20bad5155a8d73f8d807c6c1ae0f7b8041331be8` which added authentication by checking for a valid user token before proceeding with media proxy requests.
- The vulnerability is rated as High with a CVSS score of 8.6.
- The Content-Security-Policy (CSP) was modified as part of the fix to restrict media sources to 'self', preventing loading of remote media.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
