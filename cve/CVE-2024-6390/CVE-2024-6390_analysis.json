When any user views the quiz on a page/post where it is embedded or while previewing it, the XSS will be triggered by hovering the mouse over the \"Retake\" button.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nThe attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access in WordPress to edit Quiz settings.",

There are several Class level CWEs that are parents of CWE-79 such as CWE-116 and CWE-74, but CWE-79 provides the most specific description of the vulnerability. The relationships between CWEs were reviewed to ensure that the chosen CWE accurately reflects the vulnerability and its context.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe116\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe116 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events starts with **improper input sanitization**, which leads to the **Cross-Site Scripting** vulnerability, and finally results in Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly indicates that the Quiz and Survey Master WordPress plugin before version 9.1.0 does not properly sanitize and escape some of its Quizz settings. This **rootcause** leads to a **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability. The **weakness** allows high privilege users such as contributors to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\n\nThe most relevant CWE is CWE-79, which directly addresses the **improper neutralization of input during web page generation**, leading to Cross-site Scripting. This aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions the lack of sanitization and escaping of Quizz settings.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-79 with a high score and state that it is a Base level CWE, which is preferred.\n\nThe analysis considered the other CWEs listed in the retriever results, such as CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery), CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type), CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')), CWE-472 (External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter), CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) but these are not directly applicable to the described vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
