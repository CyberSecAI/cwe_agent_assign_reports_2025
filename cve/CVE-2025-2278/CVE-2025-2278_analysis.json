An authenticated user can access information about these requests via a known request ID.\n\nThe most appropriate CWE is CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key). This is because the vulnerability involves an authenticated user being able to access information they should not have access to by using a known request ID, which can be considered a user-controlled key.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"**Improper access control** in temporary access requests and checkout requests endpoints in Devolutions Server 2024.3.13 and earlier allows an authenticated user to access information about these requests via a known request ID.\" This directly indicates an authorization bypass.\n\nThe Retriever Results also list CWE-639 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is considered as a secondary candidate since it is a more general case of authorization failure.\nCWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) is considered as a secondary candidate since the user is directly requesting the information via the request ID.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately reflect the root cause and the specific mechanism of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
