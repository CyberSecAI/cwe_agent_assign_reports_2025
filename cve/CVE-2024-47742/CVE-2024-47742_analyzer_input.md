# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-47742

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved firmware_loader Block **path traversal** Most firmware names are hardcoded strings, or are constructed from fairly constrained format strings where the dynamic parts are just some hex numbers or such. However, there are a couple codepaths in the kernel where firmware file names contain string components that are passed through from a device or semi-privileged userspace the ones I could find (not counting interfaces that require root privileges) are - lpfc_sli4_request_firmware_update() seems to construct the firmware filename from ModelName, a string that was previously parsed out of some descriptor (Vital Product Data) in lpfc_fill_vpd() - nfp_net_fw_find() seems to construct a firmware filename from a model name coming from nfp_hwinfo_lookup(pf->hwinfo, nffw.partno), which I think parses some descriptor that was read from the device. (But this case likely isnt exploitable because the format string looks like netronome/nic_%s, and there shouldnt be any *folders* starting with netronome/nic_. The previous case was different because there, the %s is *at the start* of the format string.) - module_flash_fw_schedule() is reachable from the ETHTOOL_MSG_MODULE_FW_FLASH_ACT netlink command, which is marked as GENL_UNS_ADMIN_PERM (meaning CAP_NET_ADMIN inside a user namespace is enough to pass the privilege check), and takes a userspace-provided firmware name.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **path traversal**
- **attacker:** device and semi-privileged userspace
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** firmware_loader

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper validation of firmware file names before loading them. Specifically, the kernel's firmware loader was susceptible to path traversal attacks because it didn't reject firmware names containing ".." components. This allowed a malicious actor to potentially load arbitrary files as firmware by crafting a firmware filename that includes "../" sequences.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization allowing for path traversal. By including ".." sequences in the firmware name, an attacker could navigate to parent directories outside of the intended firmware location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** The most immediate impact is the potential for arbitrary file read. By crafting a firmware filename like "../../../etc/shadow", an attacker could potentially read sensitive files, including those containing system password hashes.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By reading files like `/etc/shadow`, an attacker could gain enough information to escalate privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vectors are primarily through the following interfaces that pass strings from device or semi-privileged userspace into the firmware loader:
*   **`lpfc_sli4_request_firmware_update()`**: This function constructs the firmware filename from a string called `ModelName` extracted from device descriptors.
*   **`nfp_net_fw_find()`**: This function creates the firmware filename using a model name obtained from `nfp_hwinfo_lookup`.
*   **`module_flash_fw_schedule()`**: This function is accessible through the `ETHTOOL_MSG_MODULE_FW_FLASH_ACT` netlink command, which allows a user with `CAP_NET_ADMIN` privileges within a user namespace to specify a firmware name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical access to a device:** For exploiting `lpfc_sli4_request_firmware_update()` and `nfp_net_fw_find()`, an attacker would likely need to have some control over the device or its descriptors.
*   **`CAP_NET_ADMIN` privilege in a user namespace:** For exploiting `module_flash_fw_schedule()`, an attacker would require `CAP_NET_ADMIN` over a network namespace with a specific type of Ethernet device mapped into it.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was mitigated by adding a check in the firmware loader to reject any firmware names containing ".." components.
*   The fix focuses on the firmware name itself and does not extend to the firmware base directory or symlink contents.
*   The commit messages also indicate that no USB device drivers were found to be using the firmware loader in a similarly dangerous way.

This analysis is based on the provided commit logs and the vulnerability description.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**
