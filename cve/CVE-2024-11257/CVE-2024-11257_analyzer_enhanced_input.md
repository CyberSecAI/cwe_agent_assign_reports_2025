### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** 1000 Projects Beauty Parlour Management System
- **version:** 1
- **component:** /admin/forgot-password.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization or validation of the 'email' parameter in the `admin/forgot-password.php` file. User-supplied input is directly incorporated into SQL queries without being escaped or parameterized, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `email` parameter.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The system fails to validate and sanitize user input before using it in database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **System Control:** In severe cases, attackers may gain comprehensive control over the system.
- **Service Interruption:** The vulnerability could lead to a denial of service by disrupting the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is via an HTTP POST request to the `admin/forgot-password.php` file.
- **Email Parameter:** Specifically, the malicious SQL injection payload is injected through the `email` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior login or authorization.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application and ability to make HTTP requests.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `admin/forgot-password.php` file of the "Beauty Parlour Management System PHP SQLite Project V1.0".
- The vulnerability can be exploited through boolean-based blind and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.
- Example payloads:
    - `email=-7807' OR 5969=5969-- pgJm&contactno=1222222222&submit=Reset` (boolean-based blind)
    - `email=12@qq.com' AND (SELECT 7174 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))umTD)-- VVwC&contactno=1222222222&submit=Reset` (time-based blind)
- sqlmap was used to confirm the vulnerability.
  - `sqlmap -u "http://10.211.55.6:1112/admin/forgot-password.php" --cookie="PHPSESSID=hmbfn5n9cu9uiq2n60sohgnito" --data="email=12%40qq.com&contactno=1222222222&submit=Reset" --batch --dbms=mysql --level=5 --risk=3 --dbs --random-agent`

**Suggested Remediation:**
-   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This prevents SQL code from being interpreted as SQL queries.
-   **Input validation and filtering:** Strict validation and filtering of user input data.
-   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use least privilege database accounts.
-   **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular security checks to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

The provided content gives a good summary of the vulnerability with practical examples of the attack and remediation steps.
