# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-25077

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered on Renesas SmartBond DA14691, DA14695, DA14697, and DA14699 devices. The Nonce used for on-the-fly decryption of flash images is stored in an unsigned header, allowing its value to be modified without invalidating the signature used for secureboot image verification. Because the encryption engine for on-the-fly decryption uses AES in CTR mode without authentication, an attacker-modified Nonce can result in execution of arbitrary code.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **weakness in secureboot image verification**
- **weakness:** **unsigned header for Nonce**
- **impact:** arbitrary code execution
- **vector:** modified Nonce
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Renesas SmartBond
- **version:** DA14691, DA14695, DA14697, and DA14699 devices

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-25077:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the fact that the nonce used for on-the-fly decryption of flash images is stored in an unprotected header. This allows an attacker to modify the nonce without invalidating the signature used for secure boot image verification. Because the encryption engine uses AES in CTR mode, modifying the nonce value allows an attacker to manipulate the decrypted content. Specifically, they can modify the decrypted reset vector such that execution jumps to an arbitrary address controlled by the attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unprotected Nonce:** The primary vulnerability is storing the encryption nonce in an unprotected part of the firmware image header. This allows for modification without breaking the signature verification.
*   **Lack of Authentication in CTR Mode:** The use of AES in CTR mode for decryption without any authentication mechanism means that modified encrypted data will decrypt into valid looking data, even if it's not what was originally intended. An attacker can manipulate the nonce to decrypt the image to arbitrary content.
* **Lack of integrity checking:** There are no integrity checks (such as a MAC) being done on the firmware after decryption before execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By modifying the nonce, an attacker can manipulate the decrypted firmware, redirecting the reset vector to a location of their choosing and achieving arbitrary code execution. This is demonstrated in the technical details by overwriting the reset vector and running arbitrary code in QSPI flash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Firmware Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to modify the firmware image before it is flashed onto the device, specifically they need to modify the nonce value in the firmware header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Firmware Image:** The attacker requires access to a firmware image.
*   **Ability to Modify Firmware:** The attacker must be able to modify the contents of the firmware image, specifically the nonce value.
* **Ability to Flash the Image:** The attacker needs to be able to flash the modified image to the vulnerable device.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided document includes a concrete example demonstrating how changing the nonce can result in the decryption of the reset vector being changed to point to a user-controlled section of flash, allowing for arbitrary code execution.
*   The document suggests that when the decryption key is unknown, the attack can still be executed by brute-forcing/searching nonce values that produce SPI reads outside of the signed firmware region during boot.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
