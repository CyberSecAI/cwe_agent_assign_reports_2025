  "description": "An issue was discovered on Renesas SmartBond DA14691, DA14695, DA14697, and DA14699 devices. The Nonce used for on-the-fly decryption of flash images is stored in an unsigned header, allowing its value to be modified without invalidating the signature used for secureboot image verification. Because the encryption engine for on-the-fly decryption uses AES in CTR mode without authentication, an attacker-modified Nonce can result in execution of arbitrary code.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-25077:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause lies in the fact that the nonce used for on-the-fly decryption of flash images is stored in an unprotected header. This allows an attacker to modify the nonce without invalidating the signature used for secure boot image verification. Because the encryption engine uses AES in CTR mode, modifying the nonce value allows an attacker to manipulate the decrypted content. Specifically, they can modify the decrypted reset vector such that execution jumps to an arbitrary address controlled by the attacker.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Unprotected Nonce:** The primary vulnerability is storing the encryption nonce in an unprotected part of the firmware image header. This allows for modification without breaking the signature verification.\n*   **Lack of Authentication in CTR Mode:** The use of AES in CTR mode for decryption without any authentication mechanism means that modified encrypted data will decrypt into valid looking data, even if it's not what was originally intended. An attacker can manipulate the nonce to decrypt the image to arbitrary content.\n* **Lack of integrity checking:** There are no integrity checks (such as a MAC) being done on the firmware after decryption before execution.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By modifying the nonce, an attacker can manipulate the decrypted firmware, redirecting the reset vector to a location of their choosing and achieving arbitrary code execution. This is demonstrated in the technical details by overwriting the reset vector and running arbitrary code in QSPI flash.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Firmware Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to modify the firmware image before it is flashed onto the device, specifically they need to modify the nonce value in the firmware header.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Access to Firmware Image:** The attacker requires access to a firmware image.\n*   **Ability to Modify Firmware:** The attacker must be able to modify the contents of the firmware image, specifically the nonce value.\n* **Ability to Flash the Image:** The attacker needs to be able to flash the modified image to the vulnerable device.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The provided document includes a concrete example demonstrating how changing the nonce can result in the decryption of the reset vector being changed to point to a user-controlled section of flash, allowing for arbitrary code execution.\n*   The document suggests that when the decryption key is unknown, the attack can still be executed by brute-forcing/searching nonce values that produce SPI reads outside of the signed firmware region during boot.",

CWE-345 (Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity) is a parent of CWE-347 and represents a broader class of authentication issues. CWE-306 is a peer that applies when authentication is entirely missing. The relationships show a hierarchy from general authentication problems (CWE-345) to specific signature verification issues (CWE-347) and the absence of authentication mechanisms (CWE-306). Choosing CWE-347 offers a more precise description of the **weakness** in secureboot image verification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe345 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe345,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** of using an **unsigned header for the Nonce**, which leads to **improper verification of the cryptographic signature**. The next vulnerability is the **lack of authentication in CTR mode**, and the impact is the ability to achieve **arbitrary code execution**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The key evidence is that the Nonce used for decryption is stored in an **unsigned header**, allowing modification without invalidating the signature, indicating **improper verification of the cryptographic signature**. The Retriever results and graph relationships support this classification, with CWE-347 being the most relevant. While other CWEs like CWE-345 and CWE-306 are considered, CWE-347 is the most specific and accurately describes the vulnerability. The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-347 being a Base-level CWE, providing more detail than its parent Class CWE-345.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
