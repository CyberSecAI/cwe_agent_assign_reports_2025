  "description": "Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. A vulnerability was discovered in Argo CD that **exposed secret values in error messages** and the diff view when an invalid Kubernetes Secret resource was synced from a repository. The vulnerability assumes the user has write access to the repository and can exploit it, either intentionally or unintentionally, by committing an invalid Secret to repository and triggering a Sync. Once exploited, any user with read access to Argo CD can view the exposed secret data. The vulnerability is fixed in v2.13.4, v2.12.10, and v2.11.13.",

CWE-201 is related because the sensitive information is being inserted into the data that is being sent (in this case, the error message). CWE-209 is a base level CWE which is appropriate for this vulnerability. CWE-209 can follow CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer)\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n\n    cwe212 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe209\n    cwe209 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe201\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe209 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n    class cwe212 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the user having write access to the repository, committing an invalid secret. The invalid secret triggers an error message, which then exposes the secret value. This leads to any user with read access to the Argo CD being able to view the exposed secret data. The root cause is the **improper input sanitization** that results in **exposed secret values in error messages**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the vulnerability description, the primary weakness is the exposure of secret values in error messages. The vulnerability description states that \"Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. A vulnerability was discovered in Argo CD that **exposed secret values in error messages** and the diff view when an invalid Kubernetes Secret resource was synced from a repository\". This aligns directly with CWE-209, which describes the generation of error messages containing sensitive information.\n\nThe description also mentions \"The vulnerability was caused by Argo CD exposing secret values in error messages and the diff view when syncing an invalid Kubernetes Secret resource from a repository.\". This shows the root cause is that the application did not properly handle or sanitize the input, leading to the exposure of the secret data in the error message.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-209 as a potentially relevant CWE. While other CWEs like CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) are also relevant, CWE-209 is a more direct match to the described vulnerability.\n\nTherefore, CWE-209 is selected as the primary CWE because it accurately represents the core weakness of the vulnerability: the exposure of sensitive information in error messages.\n\nCWE-201 is a good secondary match, since the error message is sent to the user.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the weakness described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere.
