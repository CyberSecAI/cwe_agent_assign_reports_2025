  "query": "Vulnerability in the Oracle Applications Framework product of Oracle E-Business Suite (component Attachments, File Upload). Supported versions that are affected are 12.2.3-12.2.14. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Applications Framework. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Applications Framework, attacks may significantly impact additional products (scope change). Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Applications Framework accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Applications Framework accessible data.
