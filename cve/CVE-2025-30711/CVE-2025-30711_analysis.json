  "description": "Vulnerability in the Oracle Applications Framework product of Oracle E-Business Suite (component Attachments, File Upload). Supported versions that are affected are 12.2.3-12.2.14. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Applications Framework. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Applications Framework, attacks may significantly impact additional products (scope change). Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Applications Framework accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Applications Framework accessible data.

There isn't a direct parent-child relationship, but they both relate to access control. CWE-287 represents the broader failure to authenticate, while CWE-280 represents issues that arise due to insufficient permissions, which can occur after a flawed or bypassed authentication. The other CWEs identified are not direct matches with the provided vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe280[\"CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\"]\n    \n    cwe280 -->|RELATED TO| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe280 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing or improper authentication** mechanism (CWE-287). Following this, even if authentication exists, the system **improperly handles insufficient permissions or privileges** (CWE-280), leading to unauthorized data access (update, insert, delete) and read access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates that a low-privileged attacker can compromise the Oracle Applications Framework via HTTP, leading to unauthorized data access. This strongly suggests a problem with authentication and authorization.\n\nCWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is a suitable primary classification because the description indicates a low-privileged attacker can compromise the system, suggesting a **failure to properly authenticate** the user or a bypass of authentication mechanisms. The successful attack leading to unauthorized access points towards a failure in verifying the identity of the user.\n\nCWE-280 (Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges) is a secondary classification because successful exploitation leads to unauthorized data modifications, which typically requires more than just authentication; it requires proper authorization checks. Even if a user is authenticated, the system might not properly check if the user has the necessary privileges to perform the requested actions.\n\nThe selection of CWE-287 and CWE-280 is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description, focusing on the root cause (authentication failure) and subsequent privilege handling issues. While other CWEs were considered, these two provide the most accurate representation of the vulnerability based on the available information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for not selecting:* While related to authentication, the description doesn't specify an issue with the authentication algorithm itself, but rather a general compromise by a low-privileged attacker.\n\n## CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for not selecting:* The description doesn't indicate any XML-related issues.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for not selecting:* While unauthorized read access is mentioned, the primary issue is the ability to compromise the system and modify data, not just read sensitive information.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for not selecting:* The description doesn't specify that a security decision depends on an untrusted input.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for not selecting:* The description doesn't specify any issues related to assumed-immutable parameters.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
