## Vulnerability Description
The Travel Booking WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to blind time-based SQL Injection via the order_id parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.6 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
