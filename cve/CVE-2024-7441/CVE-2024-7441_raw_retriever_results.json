  "query": "** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** A vulnerability was found in Vivotek SD9364 VVTK-0103f. It has been declared as critical. This vulnerability affects the function read of the component httpd. The manipulation of the argument Content-Length leads to stack-based buffer overflow. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. VDB-273526 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability. NOTE This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. NOTE Vendor was contacted early and confirmed that the affected release tree is end-of-life.",
