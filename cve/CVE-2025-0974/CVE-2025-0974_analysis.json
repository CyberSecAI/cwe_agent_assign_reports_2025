  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in MaxD Lightning Module 4.43 on OpenCart. This issue affects some unknown processing. The manipulation of the argument li_op/md leads to **deserialization**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "CVE-2025-0974\n\nThe content is directly related to CVE-2025-0974 as it explicitly references it. It provides significantly more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nDeserialization of Untrusted Data. The OpenCart Lightning module uses `unserialize()` on data received in a GET parameter (`$_GET['md']`) without proper validation, allowing for PHP Object Injection.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n* CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n* CAPEC-586: Object Injection\n* PHP Object Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nCompromise of the site, potentially leading to arbitrary file writing or Remote Code Execution (RCE) through the exploitation of POP/Gadget Chains in OpenCart (versions 3 and 4).\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n* Network: An attacker can send a crafted GET request to the vulnerable endpoint with a malicious serialized object in the `md` parameter.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n* Low privilege: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable server.\n* Knowledge of PHP serialization and object injection techniques.\n* Knowledge of available POP/Gadget Chains within OpenCart.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n* **Recommended:** Replace `unserialize()` with `json_encode()` and `json_decode()`.\n* **Alternative:** Use the `allowed_classes` option with `unserialize()` to disable object injection: `$Mmo = unserialize(substr($Mcs, $Maf + 1), ['allowed_classes' => FALSE]);`\n\nThe content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability using a `DateTime` object.",

There are no direct parent-child or chain relationships that strongly influence this specific mapping, as the vulnerability is fundamentally about the **deserialization** process itself.
