## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, this relates to **CVE-2025-0403** as it details a vulnerability in the "reggie" application. Here's a breakdown of the information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The verification code sent to the user's phone number is not properly processed and is included in the response data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Insecure handling of verification codes.
*   Exposure of sensitive information (verification code) in the API response.

**Impact of exploitation:**

An attacker can obtain the verification code and bypass authentication, allowing them to log in as any user.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker intercepts the API response when requesting a verification code.
*   The attacker then uses the intercepted verification code to log in.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Ability to intercept network traffic or access the API response.
*   No authentication required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not specify a fix, but it implies that the application needs to be modified to prevent the verification code from being included in the API response. Secure handling of verification codes is required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is reproducible when the Redis service is enabled locally.
*   The Redis service IP address can be modified in `src/main/resources/application.yml`.
*   The HTTP POST request to `/user/sendMsg` shows the vulnerable interaction.
*   The issue was reported on January 2, 2025.

The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including the specific API endpoint and request/response details.
