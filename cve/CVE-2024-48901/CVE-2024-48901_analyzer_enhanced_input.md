## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in Moodle. Additional checks are required to ensure users can only access the schedule of a report if they have permission to edit that report.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** access schedule of report
- **attacker:** users
- **product:** Moodle

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of sufficient access control checks within Moodle when fetching report schedules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The primary vulnerability is an IDOR, allowing users to access report schedules without proper authorization. Specifically, a user could potentially view the schedule of a report even if they don't have the necessary permissions to edit that report.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive information related to scheduled reports. This might include details about the report's content, timing, and recipients, which could be used for further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability likely involves a direct request to fetch a report schedule. An attacker could manipulate parameters in the request to access schedules for reports they are not authorized to see.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a user with an account on the vulnerable Moodle instance. This indicates the vulnerability is an authorization issue rather than an authentication issue.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text specifies the need for additional checks to ensure users can only access report schedules if they have permission to *edit* the report, suggesting a potential permission check was either missing or improperly implemented.
*   The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2024-48901 within the context of the Moodle platform.
*   The bug report mentions a dependency on another bug ([2318828](show_bug.cgi?id=2318828)), which likely relates to the same IDOR vulnerability on Fedora

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set ‚Äì Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* üîç *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* üîç *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion ‚Äì CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### üî∏ CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúA user created with the ‚Äòguest‚Äô role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúThe backup service runs as root but only needs read access.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### üî∏ CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúUser can access another user‚Äôs invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.‚Äù*

## Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *‚ÄúUser can escalate privileges to admin.‚Äù*
> ‚ùå Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged ‚Äì only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ‚úÖ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**
