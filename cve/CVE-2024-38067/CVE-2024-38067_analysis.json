While CWE-400 is a class-level CWE, it seems to be the most appropriate high-level categorization given the limited information. The other CWEs are peers of each other or children of CWE-295, and represent more specific certificate validation issues. The abstraction levels were considered to find the right balance between specificity and accuracy.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe299[\"CWE-299: Improper Check for Certificate Revocation\"]\n    cwe295[\"CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\"]\n    cwe297[\"CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch\"]\n\n    cwe299 -->|CHILDOF| cwe295\n    cwe297 -->|CHILDOF| cwe295\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe299,cwe295, cwe297 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a potential **improper check for certificate revocation**, **improper certificate validation**, or **improper validation of certificate with host mismatch**, leading to the impact of **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**, which results in a denial of service. The limited information makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact root cause.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment was based on the vulnerability description indicating a \"Denial of Service\" due to a weakness in the \"Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Server.\" The primary goal was to identify the root cause. Given the limited details, the analysis focused on the most relevant CWEs from the Retriever Results and Complete CWE Specifications.\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) was selected as the primary CWE due to the stated \"Denial of Service\" impact. While it's a class-level CWE, the lack of specific root cause information makes it a reasonable choice.\n\nCWE-299 (Improper Check for Certificate Revocation), CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation), and CWE-297 (Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch) were considered as potential secondary CWEs. These CWEs relate to certificate validation issues, which are relevant to the OCSP Server. The selection of these CWEs is based on their potential contribution to the resource consumption issue.\n\nThe decision to include these as secondary candidates is influenced by their presence in the Retriever Results and their relevance to certificate handling.\n\nThe selection of CWE-400 is at a higher level of abstraction due to lack of details.
