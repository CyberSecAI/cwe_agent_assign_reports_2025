  "description": "Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. Prior to version 3.3.3, a **privilege escalation vulnerability** exists in the Joplin server, allowing non-admin users to exploit the API endpoint `PATCH /api/users/id` to set the `is_admin` field to 1. The vulnerability allows malicious low-privileged users to perform administrative actions without proper authorization. This issue has been patched in version 3.3.3.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-27134 based on provided content:\n\nThis content **IS RELATED** to CVE-2025-27134. It provides a detailed security advisory for a privilege escalation vulnerability in Joplin server.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient access control checks on the `PATCH /api/users/:id` endpoint. It allows non-admin users to modify the `is_admin` field in their user profile.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **CWE-284:** Improper Access Control. Specifically, a lack of proper authorization checks when patching user properties.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nA malicious, low-privileged user can escalate their privileges to administrator level, allowing them to perform administrative actions without authorization. This includes potentially compromising the entire Joplin server.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network via the API endpoint.\n*   A simple `PATCH` request to `/api/users/:id` with the `is_admin` field set to `1` is sufficient.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated, non-admin user of the Joplin server.\n*   No specific technical skills beyond the ability to craft a simple HTTP request are required. The provided PoC is a JavaScript snippet that can be executed in a browser console.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is patched in version **3.3.3** of Joplin server.\n*   Updating to version 3.3.3 or later is the recommended mitigation.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **PoC (Proof of Concept):** The advisory includes a complete, executable PoC demonstrating the vulnerability.\n*   **CVSS Score:** The CVSS v3 score is 8.8 (High).\n*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n*   **Credits:** The vulnerability was reported by @zonia3000.\n*   **Affected versions:** <= 3.3.2\n*   **Patched versions:** 3.3.3",

While it is generally preferred to map to Base-level CWEs, in this case, the evidence strongly supports a flaw in the authorization logic, making CWE-863 the most accurate choice. CWE-863 is related to other authorization CWEs like CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), but CWE-863 specifically indicates that the authorization check is performed but incorrectly, which aligns with the vulnerability description. CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) is a possible root cause for the authorization issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n\n    cwe266 -->|CAN_PRECEDE| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe266 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **incorrect authorization** check (CWE-863) that allows non-admin users to modify the `is_admin` field, leading to **privilege escalation** and the ability to perform administrative actions. The root cause can also be traced to **incorrect privilege assignment** (CWE-266) during user creation.\n  - **Incorrect Privilege Assignment** (CWE-266)\n  - **Incorrect Authorization** (CWE-863)\n  - **Privilege Escalation** (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the provided evidence, the primary weakness is **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863), as the application performs an authorization check but does so incorrectly. This allows a non-admin user to set the `is_admin` field to 1, effectively escalating their privileges. The vulnerability description clearly states that a low-privileged user can perform administrative actions without proper authorization.\nThe key phrase from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section is \"**privilege escalation vulnerability**\".\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section indicates that the **root cause** is insufficient access control checks on the `PATCH /api/users/:id` endpoint, allowing non-admin users to modify the `is_admin` field. This aligns with CWE-863, which describes a scenario where the authorization check is performed, but incorrectly. A possible cause is **incorrect privilege assignment** (CWE-266).\n\nThe provided \"Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance\" specifically points to CWE-863 as a possible match when \"role check is present but flawed\".\n\nCWE-266 was considered as a possible **root cause**, with the system possibly assigning incorrect privileges to the user during account provisioning.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but deemed less suitable:\n\n*   CWE-285 (Improper Authorization): This is a more general category, and CWE-863 is more specific because it indicates that a check is in place, but it's incorrect.\n*   CWE-862 (Missing Authorization): This CWE would be more appropriate if there were no authorization checks at all, but the vulnerability description implies that there is a check, albeit a flawed one.\n*   CWE-284 (Improper Access Control): This is a high-level category and less specific than CWE-863.\n*   CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function): This is not applicable since the users are authenticated.\n\nThe selection of CWE-863 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it accurately reflects the nature of the vulnerability based on the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
