  "description": "Squid is an open source caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. Due to **Input Validation**, **Premature Release of Resource During Expected Lifetime**, **and Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime bugs**, Squid is vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks by a trusted server against all clients using the proxy. This bug is fixed in the default build configuration of Squid version 6.10.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45802:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from multiple issues in Squid's handling of Edge Side Includes (ESI) responses, specifically within the processing of `<esi:when>`, `<esi:assign>`, `<esi:include>`, `<esi:try>`, and `<esi:choose>` tags, as well as error handling and processing overlong headers. These issues are due to:\n    *   Input Validation failures.\n    *   Premature Release of Resources during Expected Lifetime.\n    *   Missing Release of Resources after Effective Lifetime.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Input Validation Issues:** Improper validation when processing ESI tags leads to vulnerabilities.\n*   **Resource Management Issues:**  Problems with releasing resources result in memory leaks and use-after-free conditions.\n*   **Error Handling Issues:**  Vulnerabilities occur when Squid processes errors during ESI parsing.\n*   **Header Processing Issues:**  Squid is vulnerable when processing overlong headers in the context of ESI.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A trusted server can exploit these vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted ESI responses to the Squid proxy, causing a denial of service for all clients using the proxy.\n*   **Service Disruption:** The DoS affects all domains and clients serviced by the proxy.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, as malicious ESI responses are sent over the network.\n*   **Trusted Server:** The vulnerability is exploited by a trusted server that sends crafted ESI responses to the Squid proxy.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Trusted Server Access:** The attacker needs to control a server that is considered trusted by the Squid proxy.\n*   **ESI Enabled:** The Squid proxy must have the ESI feature enabled.\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable Squid proxy.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The ESI feature is enabled by default in Squid versions 3.0 to 6.9 but disabled by default since version 6.10. The vulnerability exists if ESI is enabled in versions 6.10+.\n*   The vulnerability is limited to Squid acting as a reverse proxy with ESI enabled.\n*   The NetApp advisory states that NetApp BlueXP is affected by this vulnerability because it incorporates Squid.\n\n**CVE Score:** 7.5 (High)\n**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n\nThe information provided in the GitHub advisory provides more specific details of the vulnerability than the information provided in the NetApp advisory.",

The **Premature Release of Resource During Expected Lifetime** (CWE-826) and **Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime** (CWE-772) are related to resource management issues. CWE-826 and CWE-772 are both children of CWE-404 (Improper Resource Shutdown or Release), indicating a hierarchical relationship. The chain starts with bad input and can cause a resource to be released at the wrong time or not released at all.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe826[\"CWE-826: Premature Release of Resource During Expected Lifetime\"]\n    cwe772[\"CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n\n    cwe826 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    cwe772 -->|CHILDOF| cwe404\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe826\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe772\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe826,cwe772 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Input Validation** (CWE-20). If the input is not properly validated, it can lead to a **Premature Release of Resource During Expected Lifetime** (CWE-826) or a **Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime** (CWE-772). This in turn results in a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n`CWE-20` -> `CWE-826` or `CWE-772` -> `DoS`\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified multiple potential CWEs based on the keyphrases in the vulnerability description. The primary focus was on the **root causes** of the vulnerability, which are the **Improper Input Validation**, **Premature Release of Resource During Expected Lifetime**, and **Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime bugs**. The evidence provided indicates that these issues can lead to a Denial of Service.\n\nThe final decision was to classify the vulnerability with CWE-20 as the primary CWE, because the **Improper Input Validation** is what triggers the resource management issues. CWE-826 and CWE-772 are added as secondary CWEs since they are the actual causes of the denial of service.\n\nThe selection of CWEs is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions \"**Input Validation**, **Premature Release of Resource During Expected Lifetime**, **and Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime bugs**\".\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
