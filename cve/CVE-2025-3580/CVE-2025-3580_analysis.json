  "description": "An **access control vulnerability** was discovered in Grafana OSS where an Organization administrator could permanently delete the Server administrator account. This vulnerability exists in the DELETE /api/org/users/ endpoint. The vulnerability can be exploited when 1. An Organization administrator exists 2. The Server administrator is either - Not part of any organization, or - Part of the same organization as the Organization administrator Impact - Organization administrators can permanently delete Server administrator accounts - If the only Server administrator is deleted, the Grafana instance becomes unmanageable - No super-user permissions remain in the system - Affects all users, organizations, and teams managed in the instance The vulnerability is particularly serious as it can lead to a complete loss of administrative control over the Grafana instance.",

This represents a flawed authorization check, which aligns with the **access control vulnerability** described in the vulnerability report where Organization administrators can delete Server administrator accounts due to a flaw in the authorization logic.\nCWE-266, **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**, a Base-level CWE, and CWE-306, **Missing Authentication for Critical Function**, a Base-level CWE, are considered secondary.\nCWE-863 is a parent of CWE-942 (Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains), which was not applicable here.\nCWE-306 is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), which was also not applicable.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe266 -->|PEEROF| cwe863\n    cwe306 -->|PEEROF| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe266,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **access control vulnerability** due to **incorrect authorization**. This allows an Organization administrator to delete the Server administrator account. The impact is a potential loss of administrative control over the Grafana instance. The root cause is the **incorrect** implementation of the authorization check in the DELETE /api/org/users/ endpoint.\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Incorrect Authorization** (CWE-863) in the DELETE /api/org/users/ endpoint.\n2.  **Vulnerability:** Organization administrator can delete the Server administrator account.\n3.  **Impact:** Loss of administrative control over the Grafana instance.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-863, **Incorrect Authorization**, because the vulnerability arises from a flaw in the authorization check when an Organization administrator attempts to delete a Server administrator account. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an **access control vulnerability** in the DELETE /api/org/users/ endpoint, where Organization administrators can delete Server administrator accounts.\nThe \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this by stating: \"An access control vulnerability in the DELETE /api/org/users/ endpoint.\"\nCWE-863, **Incorrect Authorization**, directly addresses the **weakness** described.\nI considered CWE-306, **Missing Authentication for Critical Function**, but it was not the most appropriate because the issue is not a complete lack of authentication but rather a flaw in the authorization process after authentication. Also, the **guidance provided** points to CWE-306 being about \"no login required at all\" which is not the case here.\nI considered CWE-266, **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**, because deleting a Server Admin may be a privilege. However, the **access control vulnerability** is not due to the admin being assigned the wrong privilege, but due to the **incorrect authorization** check when deleting the Server Admin.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
