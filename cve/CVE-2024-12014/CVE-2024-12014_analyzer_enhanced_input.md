## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12014

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper implementation of security controls in the eSignaViewer component by Lleidanet PKI SL.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Path Traversal:** Attackers can manipulate file paths to access restricted files and directories.
    *   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** Insufficient authorization checks on user-controlled object references (like document IDs) allow attackers to bypass permissions and access unauthorized resources.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Unauthorized access to potentially sensitive files.
    *   Potential regulatory violations.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Manipulating file paths to perform path traversal.
    *   Manipulating object identifiers (e.g., document IDs) to perform IDOR attacks.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate inputs such as file paths and object identifiers.
    *   No authentication is required.

**Affected Versions:**
* 1.3.1 and earlier
* 1.4.3 and earlier
* 4.0.3 and earlier
* 4.1.2 and earlier
* 5.0.1 and earlier
* 5.1.1 and earlier
* 5.2.3 and earlier
* 5.3.2 and earlier
* 5.4.0 and earlier

**Fixed Versions:**
* 1.3.2

* 4.0.4
* 4.1.4
* 5.0.2
* 5.1.2
* 5.2.4
* 5.3.3
* 5.4.1

**Mitigation:**
* Upgrade to the corresponding fixed versions.
* Adopt additional security measures like logging suspicious activities, performing regular security audits, and monitoring for potential exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that the consequences are not "significant", but could still result in unauthorized access and regulatory violations.
*   The vendor, Lleidanet PKI SL, has released patches and implemented stronger input validation and authorization controls.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and identified by Pablo Alcarria.
