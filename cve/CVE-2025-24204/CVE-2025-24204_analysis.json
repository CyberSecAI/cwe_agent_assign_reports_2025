The description indicates that an app may be able to access protected user data, and the root cause is identified as the issue being addressed with improved checks.\n\nThe initial assessment focused on the **impact** and **root cause**. The core issue appears to be that the checks are **improper**, leading to the ability to bypass intended authorization mechanisms. This points towards CWE-285.\n\nCWE-285 is a Class-level CWE. Although the guidance discourages the use of class-level CWEs, the information available doesn't allow for more specific identification.\n\nThe selection of CWE-285 is influenced by the fact that the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to protected user data, highlighting a failure in authorization. The fix, \"improved checks,\" further supports this assessment.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not selected:\n*   CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write - While this is a high-scoring CWE, there's no evidence to suggest memory corruption.\n*   CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion') - There's no indication of type confusion.\n*   CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature - No cryptographic functions are mentioned.\n*   CWE-1263: Improper Physical Access Control - This is plausible, but less directly supported by the description.\n*   CWE-665: Improper Initialization - There's no indication of uninitialized variables causing the issue.\n\nThe evidence points to a problem with authorization checks, making CWE-285 the most appropriate choice given the limited information.",
