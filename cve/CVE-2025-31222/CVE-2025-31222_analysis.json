Specifically, the guidance clearly distinguishes between privilege assignment issues (CWE-266) and authorization flaws (CWE-285). The description states a user may be able to elevate privileges and the guidance notes that **privileges** represent the *actor's identity level* or capabilities, suggesting a problem with how privileges are assigned, leading to the selection of CWE-266.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe266 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe266 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **correctness issue** that leads to a user being able to **elevate privileges**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nMy analysis is heavily based on the provided evidence, particularly the vulnerability description and the CWE Classification Guidance. The description states \"A user may be able to elevate privileges\". The CWE guidance suggests that privilege escalation, in the context of assigning the wrong role, maps to CWE-266.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced my selection by highlighting the hierarchical structure.
