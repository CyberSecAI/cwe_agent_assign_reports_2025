  "description": "SPID.AspNetCore.Authentication is an AspNetCore Remote Authenticator for SPID. Authentication using Spid and CIE is based on the SAML2 standard which provides two entities Identity Provider (IDP) the system that authenticates users and provides identity information (SAML affirmation) to the Service Provider, in essence, is responsible for the management of the credentials and identity of users Service Provider (SP) the system that provides a service to the user and relies on the Identity Provider to authenticate the user, receives SAML assertions from the IdP to grant access to resources. The validation logic of the signature is central as it ensures that you cannot create a SAML response with arbitrary assertions and then impersonate other users. There is **no guarantee that the first signature refers to the root object**, it follows that if an attacker injects an item signed as the first element, all other signatures will not be verified. The only requirement is to have an XML element legitimately signed by the IdP, a condition that is easily met using the IdPs public metadata. An attacker could create an arbitrary SAML response that would be accepted by SPs using vulnerable SDKs, allowing him to impersonate any Spid and/or CIE user. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 3.4.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

This allows an attacker to inject a legitimate signed XML element as the first element, and then include a malicious, unsigned or attacker-signed assertion.\n- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n  - SAML Response Signature Verification Bypass\n  - The library fails to properly validate the SAML response by only checking the first signature.\n- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can create a crafted SAML response, allowing them to impersonate any SPID/CIE user.\n- Attack vectors:\n  - The attacker needs a valid signed XML block from an IdP. This can be obtained from the public metadata of the IdP.\n  - The attacker can then craft a malicious SAML response by injecting the valid signed block and an attacker-controlled assertion.\n- Required attacker capabilities/position:\n  - Knowledge of SAML protocol and the structure of SAML responses.\n  - Access to the public metadata of the IdP.\n  - Ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests/responses.\n- Mitigation or fix: Verify all signatures present in the SAML response and do not accept unsigned XML elements.\n- More detail than the official CVE description: Yes\n```",

While CWE-345 is a broader category, CWE-347 specifically addresses cryptographic signatures, making it a more precise fit for the vulnerability. There aren't any strong chain relationships apparent from the retriever results.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    \n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe345 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper verification of the cryptographic signature** (CWE-347). Because **there is no guarantee that the first signature refers to the root object** in the SAML response, an attacker can inject a signed element as the first element, bypassing signature validation. This leads to the ability to create arbitrary SAML responses and impersonate users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary CWE is based on the root cause identified in the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary: the library **fails to properly validate the SAML response by only checking the first signature.** This aligns perfectly with CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature). The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-347 as the top candidate. The evidence is strong, and the mapping guidance for CWE-347 indicates that it is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\nThe selection of CWE-347 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **improper verification of cryptographic signatures**, which is the root cause of the vulnerability. Other CWEs like CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) or CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) are too high-level and do not accurately capture the specific flaw in signature validation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
