CWE-212 is more specific, describing the **improper removal** of sensitive information, which directly leads to the exposure described by CWE-200. Therefore, CWE-212 is chosen as the primary CWE due to its higher specificity and relevance to the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe212 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe212 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to redact** remote users' email addresses (CWE-212). This leads directly to the exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized actors (CWE-200).\n\nCWE-212 (Root Cause) -> CWE-200 (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly states that the application **fails to redact** remote users' email addresses. This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-212, which involves the **improper removal of sensitive information before storage or transfer**.\n\nThe retriever results also support this conclusion, with CWE-212 being a relevant candidate. While CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is also a potential candidate, it represents the impact rather than the root cause.\n\nThe graph relationships further reinforce the selection of CWE-212 as the primary CWE, as it can precede CWE-200 in a vulnerability chain.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description and the understanding of CWE relationships, which is that the vulnerability is caused by the **failure to redact** information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 526.10\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 520.30\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error. As of CWE 4.9, over 400 CWE entries can lead to a loss of confidentiality. Other",
