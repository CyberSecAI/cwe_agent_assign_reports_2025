  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in Tenda AC7 1200M 15.03.06.44. Affected is the function TendaTelnet of the file /goform/telnet. The manipulation of the argument lan_ip leads to **os command injection**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**os command injection**\" due to manipulation of the argument lan_ip in the TendaTelnet function. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of the vulnerability description's \"**os command injection**\" to CWE-78. While other CWEs such as CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')) were considered, CWE-78 is more specific and therefore more appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** Improper neutralization of special elements in the `lan_ip` argument within the `TendaTelnet` function. (CWE-78)\n2.  **Impact:** Remote attackers can inject OS commands.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates \"**os command injection**\" as the root cause due to the **improper handling of the `lan_ip` argument** in the `TendaTelnet` function. This maps directly to CWE-78, which describes the **improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command**. The retriever results strongly support this with a score of 1.0 for CWE-78 using alternate terms. The relationship analysis confirms that while CWE-77 is a parent, CWE-78 is more specific and accurately reflects the nature of the vulnerability. The evidence is strong and directly supports the selection of CWE-78 as the primary weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: alternate_terms\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended command when it is sent to a downstream component.

These are not applicable as the vulnerability is specifically an OS command injection.\n*   **CWE-259:** This relates to hardcoded passwords, which isn't mentioned in the vulnerability.\n*   **CWE-184:** This relates to an incomplete list of disallowed inputs, but the primary issue here is the lack of proper neutralization, not the incompleteness of a blacklist.",
