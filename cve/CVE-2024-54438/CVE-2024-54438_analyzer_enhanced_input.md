## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Gaxx Keywords Plugin for WordPress, versions 0.2 and below, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CSRF:** The plugin lacks proper protection against CSRF attacks. This means that a malicious attacker could potentially trick a logged-in user into performing unwanted actions on the WordPress site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker could force a higher-privileged user (e.g., an administrator) to perform actions they did not intend to, under the user's authentication. The specific impact depends on the plugin's functionality and the actions that can be triggered via CSRF.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through a web browser. An attacker would craft a malicious request (e.g., through a link on a website, email, etc.) that, if clicked by a logged-in user of the vulnerable WordPress site, would cause the user's browser to perform an action within the vulnerable plugin on the site.
*   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into interacting with the malicious request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not require prior authentication to the vulnerable WordPress site itself but needs a logged-in user to trigger the attack.
*   The attacker needs to create and host the malicious request to exploit the CSRF vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is classified as having a "Low" patch priority and severity impact (though the CVSS score is 7.1 which is "High").
*   There is currently no official fix available for the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported by researcher SOPROBRO.
* The plugin is also classified under OWASP Top 10 A1: Broken Access Control.
