The product performs an authorization check, but it does not correctly perform the check. |\n| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.7 | Pillar | Discouraged | Secondary. Used because the client side access control bypass ultimately leads to improper access control. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-863 which is a Class level CWE. The vulnerability involves a **client side access control bypass** leading to **incorrect authorization**. CWE-863 is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), which is a more general category. However, since the description specifically mentions an access control bypass on the client side, which implies the authorization check is present but flawed, CWE-863 is a more precise fit than CWE-284. CWE-284 is used as a secondary CWE to show that client side access control bypass ultimately leads to improper access control.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **client side access control bypass**, which leads to **incorrect authorization**, and finally results in the ability to bypass permission restrictions such as View Password, Edit Asset, and Edit Permissions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-863 as the primary CWE due to the **client side access control bypass**, which implies that the authorization check is present but flawed. The retriever results also listed CWE-863 as a potential candidate, further supporting this assessment. The relationship analysis confirmed that CWE-863 is a more specific fit than its parent CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). The vulnerability chain analysis illustrated how the **client side access control bypass** leads to **incorrect authorization** and ultimately the ability to bypass permission restrictions. The final decision is based on the available evidence, relationship analysis, and vulnerability chain analysis, and that CWE-863 is the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 2407.43\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-284: Improper Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.348\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe software does not properly control access to resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This is a very general CWE that is frequently misused.

This is a high-level issue, and CWE-284 is a high-level Class (Pillar) useful when the root cause is unclear. The Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance also states that CWE-284 should be reserved for general access control issues when it\u2019s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.\n\nThe **client side access control bypass** is the ROOTCAUSE.",
