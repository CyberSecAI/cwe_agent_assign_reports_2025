If the user doesnt explicitly set `submarine.auth.default.secret`, a default value will be used. This issue affects Apache Submarine Commons Utils from 0.8.0. As this project is retired, we do not plan to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users.

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36264:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from the use of a hard-coded default secret (`SUBMARINE_AUTH_SECRET`) within the Apache Submarine Commons Utils. This means that if the application is deployed without configuring a custom secret, all installations would share the same secret, potentially allowing unauthorized access.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Improper Authentication:** The primary weakness is the use of a default, hard-coded authentication secret. This violates the principle of secure defaults, as the default secret is known to the developers and could be potentially discovered by malicious actors.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   The impact is described as \"low\", but if exploited, it could lead to unauthorized access to systems relying on this component for authentication. The degree of impact would depend on the scope of the affected systems. This is further mitigated by the fact that the project is retired.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker who has knowledge of the default secret could leverage it to bypass authentication mechanisms in systems using the vulnerable Apache Submarine Commons Utils library.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to know the hard-coded default secret. If that secret is not changed by a user, any user knowing the secret can access the service. No particular network position is mentioned.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was addressed by retrieving the `SUBMARINE_AUTH_SECRET` from an environment variable rather than using the hardcoded value. This is described in the provided link to the pull request ([https://github.com/apache/submarine/pull/1125](https://github.com/apache/submarine/pull/1125)). However, the fix was not released and the project is retired.\n*   The CVE description notes that this vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. Users are advised to find an alternative.\n*   The provided content indicates some disagreement on the fix, suggesting it should be revisited. However, as the project is archived, no further action is likely.\n*   The issue is tracked as `SUBMARINE-1417`.",

CWE-798 directly addresses the use of hard-coded credentials, while CWE-287 represents a broader class of improper authentication issues. The relationship shows that the specific flaw (hard-coded credentials) leads to a more general authentication problem. Since CWE-798 is a more specific Base level CWE, it is preferred.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe798 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe798 primary\n    class cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of hard-coded credentials** (CWE-798) as the root cause. This **leads to improper authentication** (CWE-287), as the system relies on a secret that is not unique or securely managed. The potential impact is unauthorized access to systems relying on this component for authentication.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment identified the **root cause** as an **\"Improper Authentication vulnerability\"** related to the use of a hard-coded default secret in Apache Submarine Commons Utils. This aligns directly with CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials), which is a base-level CWE and provides a precise description of the weakness. The CVE description states that if the user doesn't explicitly set `submarine.auth.default.secret`, a default value will be used. This confirms the use of hard-coded credentials.\n\nCWE-287 (Improper Authentication) was considered as a broader classification but was deemed less specific than CWE-798. While the vulnerability does result in improper authentication, the root cause is the hard-coded credential itself. Therefore, CWE-798 is the more appropriate primary CWE. The retriever results also identified CWE-287, but it is a discouraged CWE as a Class level CWE.\n\nThe evidence from the CVE description and the retriever results strongly supports the selection of CWE-798 as the primary CWE, providing a clear and specific characterization of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n**CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials**\n\n*   **Abstraction Level**: Base\n*   **Description**: The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key, which it uses for its own inbound authentication, outbound authentication, or encryption.\n*   **Mapping Guidance**: Usage: Allowed\n\n**CWE-287: Improper Authentication**\n\n*   **Abstraction Level**: Class\n*   **Description**: When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.\n*   **Mapping Guidance**: Usage: Discouraged - This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable.",
