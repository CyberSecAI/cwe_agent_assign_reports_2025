  "description": "The Schema App Structured Data plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Cross-Site Request Forgery** in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.0. This is due to **missing or incorrect nonce validation** on the MarkUpdate function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update and delete post metadata via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `MarkUpdate` function within the Schema App Structured Data plugin. This function is responsible for updating and deleting post metadata.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper nonce verification when handling requests to update or delete post metadata. This allows an attacker to forge a request that, if triggered by a logged-in administrator, could lead to unauthorized data modification.\n- **Insufficient Input Validation:** While not explicitly stated, the use of `sanitize_textarea_field` and `sanitize_key` suggests that the plugin attempts to sanitize input, but the core issue is the lack of nonce validation.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized Metadata Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete post metadata. This could potentially alter the schema data associated with posts, impacting SEO and how search engines perceive the website.\n- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Depending on how the plugin uses the metadata, the attacker may be able to inject malicious data that could lead to other vulnerabilities.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Forged Requests:** The attack involves creating a malicious request that mimics a legitimate request to the `MarkUpdate` function.\n- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must trick a logged-in administrator into performing an action, such as clicking a crafted link or visiting a malicious page, that executes the forged request.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Unauthenticated Attacker:** The attacker does not need to have a valid account on the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.\n- **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to convince an authenticated administrator to perform an action that triggers the forged request.\n- **Knowledge of the Plugin:** The attacker needs to know the structure of the request to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n- The provided code snippets show the vulnerable `MarkupUpdate` function and the nonce check within it.\n- The code also shows the generation of a nonce using `wp_create_nonce` and its localization for use in javascript.\n- The fix involves adding the correct nonce verification, likely using `wp_verify_nonce`, before updating or deleting post meta.\n- The vulnerability affects versions up to and including 2.2.0 of the plugin. Version 2.2.1 has patched this vulnerability",

The vulnerability description clearly states this, and the provided summary reinforces that the lack of proper nonce verification allows attackers to forge requests. The retriever results also identify CWE-352 as a strong candidate.
