All versions of Subversion up to and including Subversion 1.14.4 are affected if serving repositories via mod_dav_svn. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.14.5, which fixes this issue.

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-46901:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-1968. The original patch failed to fully prevent control characters in filenames, leaving `mod_dav_svn` vulnerable. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the lack of input validation in `mod_dav_svn` when handling paths and revision properties containing control characters. The XML library used by Subversion to parse responses could raise errors when these invalid characters are encountered.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core weakness lies in the failure of `mod_dav_svn` to properly validate paths and revision properties against control characters before processing them. This allows the injection of these characters into repository data.\n- **XML Parsing Errors:** The presence of control characters leads to errors in the XML library used for response processing, causing disruptions.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to denial-of-service for users accessing the repository via HTTP.\n- **Repository Disruption/Corruption:** The vulnerability allows the introduction of invalid paths or revision properties, causing issues that might necessitate a full repository dump/load to restore proper operation. This can disrupt the usage of the repository for all users.\n- **Error Responses:**  Clients can encounter errors like `svn: E175009: The XML response contains invalid XML` or `svn: E130003: Malformed XML: not well-formed (invalid token)`. Web interfaces can return `500 Internal Server Error`.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Malicious Client:** A custom or malicious Subversion client can be crafted to introduce filenames with control characters into the repository.\n- **Third-Party Implementations:** Non-standard Subversion client implementations could also introduce control characters by bypassing the standard checks.\n- **Authenticated Commit Access:**  Attackers with commit access can directly introduce control characters through malicious commits.\n- **Anonymous Write Access:** If the Subversion server allows anonymous write access, the vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Commit Access (Authenticated):** An attacker needs commit privileges to introduce the control characters through commits.\n- **Anonymous Access (Unauthenticated):** If the server configuration permits it, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability anonymously through write access.\n- **Custom Client:** The attacker needs either a custom-built Subversion client or a third-party client that doesn't enforce the usual control character restrictions to introduce these characters.",
