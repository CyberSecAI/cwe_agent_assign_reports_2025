  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved netfilter ipset Fix race between namespace cleanup and gc in the listset type Lion Ackermann reported that there is a **race condition** between namespace cleanup in ipset and the garbage collection of the listset type. The namespace cleanup can destroy the listset type of sets while the gc of the set type is waiting to run in rcu cleanup. The latter uses data from the destroyed set which thus leads **use after free**. The patch contains the following parts - When destroying all sets, first remove the garbage collectors, then wait if needed and then destroy the sets. - Fix the badly ordered wait then remove gc for the destroy a single set case. - Fix the missing rcu locking in the listset type in the userspace test case. - Use proper RCU list handlings in the listset type. The patch depends on c1193d9bbbd3 (netfilter ipset Add list flush to cancel_gc).",

CWE-416 is a variant of CWE-754 (Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions), which is a child of CWE-697 (Incorrect Comparison).

This leads to the namespace cleanup destroying the listset type while the garbage collector is running. The garbage collector then attempts to use data from the destroyed set, resulting in a **use-after-free** (CWE-416).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the primary weakness is CWE-416 (Use After Free), which is a direct result of a **race condition** (CWE-362). The vulnerability description clearly states that \"The namespace cleanup can destroy the listset type of sets while the gc of the set type is waiting to run in rcu cleanup. The latter uses data from the destroyed set which thus leads **use after free**\". The retriever results also highlight CWE-362 as a highly relevant CWE due to the **race condition**. CWE-416 is chosen as the primary CWE because it represents the direct consequence of the **race condition**. The relationship graph supports this by showing that race conditions can precede use-after-free vulnerabilities. CWE-362 is kept as a secondary CWE as it is the condition that allows for the **use-after-free** to occur.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n# Vulnerability Description\n\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved netfilter ipset Fix **race** between namespace cleanup and gc in the listset type Lion Ackermann reported that there is a **race condition** between namespace cleanup in ipset and the garbage collection of the listset type.
