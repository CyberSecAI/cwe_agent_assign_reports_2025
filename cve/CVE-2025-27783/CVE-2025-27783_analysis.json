There is no check if the file is copied the expected, static `custom_embedder_root` path.\n* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    * Arbitrary file write\n* **Impact of exploitation:**\n    * Writing arbitrary files on the applio server. It can also be used in conjunction with any of the unsafe deserialisations to achieve remote code execution.\n* **Attack vectors:**\n    * Exploitation involves providing crafted input for the `folder_name_input` parameter.\n* **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n    * The user running the application has write access to a given path.\n* **Mitigation or fix:**\n    * Not provided\n```",
