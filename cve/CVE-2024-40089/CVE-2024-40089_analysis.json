  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Vilo router's hostname, configurable through the Vilo app, is directly inserted into a `udhcpc` command executed using C's `system()` function, without proper sanitization. This allows for command injection by setting the hostname to a malicious string.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:\n  - Command injection vulnerability due to unsanitized user input being passed to `system()`\n  - Lack of input validation or sanitization on the Vilo name field\n- **Impact of exploitation**:\n  - Arbitrary code execution as root on the underlying operating system of the Vilo router.\n  - An attacker can gain complete control of the device by injecting malicious commands\n- **Attack vectors**:\n  - Network-based attack by exploiting the Vilo app functionality to change the router's name\n  - Physical access can be leveraged for debugging through UART, which provides visibility into executed commands.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:\n  - An attacker needs to have access to the Vilo app and be able to modify the Vilo router name setting.\n  - The attacker must know how to exploit a command injection vulnerability.\n- **Additional details**:\n   - The command injection has a 32-character limit. This limitation can be bypassed by performing multiple injections to construct and execute more complex commands.\n   - The vulnerability exists because the Vilo name is used within a `udhcpc` command string that is passed to the `system()` function.\n   - The `sysconf` binary executes the vulnerable `udhcpc` command at boot.\n   - The provided steps to reproduce details how to create and execute a shell script after multiple injections.",
