  "description": "A vulnerability in the interprocess communication (IPC) channel of Cisco Secure Client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a **DLL hijacking** attack on an affected device if the Secure Firewall Posture Engine, formerly HostScan, is installed on Cisco Secure Client. This vulnerability is due to **insufficient validation of resources that are loaded by the application at run time**. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPC message to a specific Cisco Secure Client process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected machine with SYSTEM privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid user credentials on the Windows system.",

The application loads resources from an uncontrolled search path, leading to DLL hijacking. |\n| CWE-269 | Improper Privilege Management | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. The vulnerability ultimately leads to execution with SYSTEM privileges, suggesting a problem in privilege management. However, CWE-427 is the more direct root cause. |\n| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.4 | Pillar | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. The crafted IPC message circumvents the intended access control mechanisms. However, this is a high-level categorization. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-427, which directly explains the DLL hijacking vulnerability. CWE-269 and CWE-284 are higher-level classifications that describe the impact of the vulnerability. The child-parent relationship between CWE-427 and its parent CWEs (e.g., those related to access control) were considered, but CWE-427 provides the most specific description of the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe427[\"CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe427 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe269\n    cwe427 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe427 primary\n    class cwe269,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient validation of resources** (which leads to **CWE-427 Uncontrolled Search Path Element**), enabling **DLL hijacking**, ultimately resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-427 (Uncontrolled Search Path Element) due to the **insufficient validation of resources that are loaded by the application at run time**, which directly enables the **DLL hijacking** attack. This aligns with the description of CWE-427, where the product uses a search path that can be controlled by unintended actors. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the issue lies in the **insufficient validation of resources**, which is a clear indication of an uncontrolled search path.\n\nThe retriever results strongly support CWE-427 as the primary CWE. The description and CVE reference summary highlight the root cause as a failure to properly validate resources loaded at runtime, making the system vulnerable to DLL hijacking. This is a direct consequence of an uncontrolled search path, where a malicious DLL can be placed and loaded by the application.\n\nCWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) was considered because the ultimate impact is execution with SYSTEM privileges. However, CWE-427 is a more direct representation of the root cause. Similarly, CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) is a higher-level categorization and less specific than CWE-427.\n\nThe choice of CWE-427 is at the appropriate level of specificity (Base) as it directly describes the weakness.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
