  "description": "A vulnerability has been found in StarSea99 starsea-mall 1.0/2.X and classified as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is the function updateUserInfo of the file /personal/updateInfo of the component com.siro.mall.controller.mall.UserController. The manipulation of the argument userId leads to **improper access controls**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

Specifically, the code updates user information based on an ID retrieved from the session, but then retrieves data using the ID provided in the request (userId parameter), leading to a mismatch and allowing access to another user's account. The session ID is also overwritten with the attacker-controlled `userId`.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Insecure update logic: The application updates user information based on a session ID but retrieves data based on a potentially attacker-controlled `userId` parameter.\n*   Session ID manipulation: The session ID is overwritten with the attacker-controlled `userId`.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation allows an attacker to gain access to and control other users' accounts, effectively achieving arbitrary user login.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Network: An attacker can intercept and modify the `userId` parameter in network requests (e.g., using a proxy like Burp Suite) to target different user accounts.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Network access to the application.\n*   Ability to intercept and modify network traffic (e.g., using a proxy).\n*   Basic understanding of web application request/response structure.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe vulnerability should be fixed by ensuring that the user ID used for both updating and retrieving user information is consistent and securely obtained from the session, preventing manipulation through request parameters.",

The vulnerability description and CVE summary clearly state that the **improper access controls** are due to the ability to modify the userId, leading to unauthorized access. |\n| CWE-359 | Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. Since the attacker gains access to another user's account, it is possible there could be exposure of private information. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship considered was a direct match to CWE-639, Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key, as the vulnerability involves manipulating the `userId` parameter to access other user accounts. The other considered relationship was CWE-359 as the information of other users could potentially be exposed.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe359 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper access controls** due to the manipulation of the `userId` parameter (CWE-639). This leads to the attacker gaining access to another user's account. A potential impact of this access could be the exposure of that user's private information (CWE-359).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the root cause as **improper access controls** due to the manipulation of the `userId` argument, leading to the selection of CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) as the primary CWE. This is strongly supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states, \"The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\" The graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the direct connection between the user-controlled key and the authorization bypass. The chosen CWE is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability. There could be the potential to expose a users private information, leading to the selection of CWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor) as a secondary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used:** While the `userId` could be considered an assumed-immutable parameter, CWE-639 more directly addresses the authorization bypass.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used:** CWE-639 is more specific in describing how the authorization bypass occurs.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used:** While there's a possibility of exposing system information, the primary issue is the authorization bypass itself.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Used:** This is the primary CWE, as explained above.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
