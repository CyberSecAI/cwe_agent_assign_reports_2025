## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in HDF5 up to 1.14.6. This vulnerability affects the function H5F__accum_free of the file src/H5Faccum.c. The manipulation of the argument overlap_size leads to **heap-based buffer overflow**. Attacking locally is a requirement. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap-based buffer overflow**
- **vector:** manipulation of argument overlap_size
- **product:** HDF5
- **version:** up to 1.14.6
- **component:** H5F__accum_free in src/H5Faccum.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
CVE-2025-2915: PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval

The provided content details a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the HDF5 library (hdf5 v1.14.6). Here's a breakdown of the information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `H5F__accum_free` function (src/H5Faccum.c, line 885).  The function fails to correctly check buffer boundaries when calculating the `overlap_size` and subsequently uses this potentially large value in a `memmove` operation, leading to a heap-buffer-overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow:**  The core issue is an out-of-bounds write due to insufficient bounds checking.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Application crash.
*   Potential for arbitrary code execution (though not explicitly stated, a heap overflow can often be leveraged for this).

**Attack vectors:**

*   Processing specially crafted HDF5 files. The provided PoC demonstrates this using a fuzzer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious HDF5 file to the vulnerable application.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The issue is labeled as a "Blocker" for the Release 2.0.0, indicating a fix is required before release.  The content does not provide the fix itself.

**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**

*   The content includes a detailed code snippet showing the vulnerable section of the `H5F__accum_free` function.
*   A PoC (Proof of Concept) is provided, including build instructions and a sample file that triggers the vulnerability.
*   The report from AddressSanitizer (ASan) is included, pinpointing the location of the overflow.
*   The issue is tracked as GitHub issue #5380.
