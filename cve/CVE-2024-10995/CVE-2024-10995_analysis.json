  "reference_content": "The provided content is related to CVE-2024-10995.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `removeDoctorResult.php` file of the 'Hospital Appointment System In PHP With Source Code' project. This is caused by the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `Name` parameter before it's used in SQL queries.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nThe primary weakness is the direct use of user-supplied input (`Name` parameter) in SQL queries without proper sanitization. This allows for SQL injection. The vulnerability is present in the `removeDoctorResult.php` file. The vulnerability is described as being boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nAttackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe attack vector is through the HTTP POST request to the `removeDoctorResult.php` file with a manipulated `Name` parameter containing malicious SQL code.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nThe attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application. No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe attacker must craft a malicious payload within the Name parameter to exploit the vulnerability.",

The vulnerability involves the **improper neutralization** of special elements in an SQL command, directly leading to **SQL injection**. There are no identified parent-child or chain relationships that would suggest a more specific or related CWE in this case.

This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-89 as the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an SQL command.
