Prior to commit c4f81d9616d40c60584e36abb15300853a66e489, the `vis_params` variable on line 1254 in `pages/1__Timelapse.py` takes user input, which is later used in the `eval()` function on line 1345, leading to remote code execution.

  "reference_content": "The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in the `streamlit-geospatial` project. CVE-2024-41116 is associated with `GHSL-2024-104`, which is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in `pages/1_\ud83d\udcf7_Timelapse.py` related to the `MODIS Ocean Color SMI` option's `vis_params`.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n- The application takes user-provided input for visualization parameters (`vis_params`) and uses it within an `eval()` function. This allows the user to execute arbitrary Python code.\n\n**Vulnerability:**\n\n- Uncontrolled use of `eval()` with user input: The application directly evaluates user-provided strings, allowing for the injection of malicious code.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the `streamlit-geospatial` application. This can lead to full control of the server, data breaches, and other malicious activities.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- User input through the `Enter visualization parameters` text area in the `MODIS Ocean Color SMI` section of the `\ud83d\udcf7 Timelapse` tab.\n\n**Attacker Capabilities:**\n\n- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application's web interface and provide malicious input into the `Enter visualization parameters` text area when the `MODIS Ocean Color SMI` option is selected.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n- The vulnerability occurs in `pages/1_\ud83d\udcf7_Timelapse.py` at line 1254 where the `vis_params` variable is defined and then evaluated using `eval()` at line 1345 within the conditional block where `collection == \"MODIS Ocean Color SMI\"`.\n\n```python\nvis_params = st.text_area(\n    \"Enter visualization parameters\",\n    \"\",\n    help=\"Enter a string in the format of a dictionary, such as '{'min': 23, 'max': 32}'\",\n)\n\n--- snip\n\n        elif collection == \"MODIS Ocean Color SMI\":\n            if vis_params.startswith(\"{\") and vis_params.endswith(\n                \"}\"\n            ):\n                vis_params = eval(vis_params)\n```\n**Mitigation:**\nThe provided commit diff shows that the `eval()` calls were replaced with `json.loads()`, which will prevent the execution of arbitrary code. Additionally, a check was added to ensure the input is a dictionary.\n```diff\n--- a/pages/1_\ud83d\udcf7_Timelapse.py\n+++ b/pages/1_\ud83d\udcf7_Timelapse.py\n@@ -1342,7 +1347,9 @@\n                 \"}\"\n             ):\n                 vis_params = eval(vis_params)\n+                vis_params = json.loads(\n+                    vis_params.replace(\"'\", '\"')\n+                )\n             else:\n                 vis_params = None\n             out_gif = geemap.modis_ocean_color_timelapse(\n\n```",
