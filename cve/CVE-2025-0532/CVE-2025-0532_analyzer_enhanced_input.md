## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE Content

This content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it is **NOT** associated with the placeholder CVE ID (CVE-2025-0532). It details a SQL Injection vulnerability in "Gym Management System (PHP) v1.0". The content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

Lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `m_id` parameter in `/dashboard/admin/new_submit.php`, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection (Error-based and Time-based blind)

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Database compromise (read, modify, delete data)
*   Data leakage of sensitive information (customer/payment data)
*   System interruption (performance degradation, crashes)
*   Potential privilege escalation

**Attack vectors:**

*   HTTP request parameter manipulation (`m_id` in `/dashboard/admin/new_submit.php`)
*   No authentication required for exploitation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Ability to craft malicious SQL payloads.
*   Network access to the vulnerable application.

**Mitigation or fix:**

1.  **Use Prepared Statements / Parameter Binding:** Separate SQL logic from user-supplied data.
2.  **Enforce Strict Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize the `m_id` parameter.
3.  **Apply the Principle of Least Privilege:** Configure database users with minimal privileges.
4.  **Schedule Regular Security Audits:** Conduct code reviews, penetration testing, and dependency checks.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Product:** Gym Management System in PHP with Source Code, v1.0
*   **Vulnerable File:** `/dashboard/admin/new_submit.php`
*   **Parameter:** `m_id`
*   **Vendor Homepage:** [https://codezips.com/php/gymmanagementsytem/](https://codezips.com/php/gymmanagementsytem/)
*   **Download Link:** [https://codeload.github.com/codezips/gym-management-system-php/zip/master](https://codeload.github.com/codezips/gym-management-system-php/zip/master)
*   **Sample Payloads:** Provided for both error-based and time-based blind SQL injection.
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):**  Includes a `sqlmap` command example.
*   **Screenshots:** Provided as a link to a private user image.
*   **References:** Links to the vendor homepage, OWASP SQL Injection page, and the sqlmap project.
