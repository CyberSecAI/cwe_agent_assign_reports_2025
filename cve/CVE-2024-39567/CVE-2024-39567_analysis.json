While CWE-77 is a Class-level CWE, it directly reflects the identified vulnerability based on the description, which mentions \"**command injection**\". CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is included as a secondary CWE to represent the root cause of the vulnerability, \"**missing server side input sanitation**\".\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe77 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe77 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing server side input sanitation** (CWE-20). This leads to the **command injection** vulnerability (CWE-77), which allows an authenticated local attacker to execute arbitrary code with system privileges.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-20 Improper Input Validation\n  - **Weakness:** CWE-77 Command Injection\n  - **Impact:** Arbitrary Code Execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference content summary. The key phrases \"missing server side input sanitation\" and \"command injection\" strongly indicate the presence of CWE-77 and CWE-20.\n\nCWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')) is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**command injection**\". This aligns with the CWE's description, which focuses on the improper neutralization of special elements used in commands. The description also notes \"**missing server side input sanitation**\" which aligns with CWE-20 Improper Input Validation.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is included as a secondary CWE to represent the root cause of the vulnerability. The retriever results also list CWE-20, further supporting its relevance.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they directly reflect the identified weakness and its root cause based on the evidence provided.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
