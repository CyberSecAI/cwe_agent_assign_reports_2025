## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in 1000 Projects Human Resource Management System 1.0. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /employeeview.php. The manipulation of the argument search leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** 1000 Projects Human Resource Management System
- **version:** 1
- **component:** /employeeview.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the security bulletin:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the application's direct inclusion of user-supplied input from the `search` parameter into SQL statements without proper sanitization or validation. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which can be exploited in multiple ways:
    - Boolean-based blind SQL injection
    - Error-based SQL injection
    - Time-based blind SQL injection
    - UNION query SQL injection

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
    - Data Breach: Unauthorized access to confidential HR records.
    - Data Tampering: Unauthorized modification or deletion of employee information.
    - System Disruption: Corruption of the application's database.
    - Privilege Escalation:  Potential to move to more sensitive areas of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to `/employeeview.php`, where a malicious payload is injected into the `search` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No authentication is required. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability anonymously over the network.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No specific position required to perform the attack.

**Additional Information:**
- The advisory provides sample payloads for different types of SQL injection attacks.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) using SQLmap is included.
- The vulnerable application is "Human Resource Management System v1.0".
- The specific vulnerable file is `/employeeview.php`.
- The advisory includes links to download the source code and the vendor homepage.
- The advisory provides recommendations to mitigate the vulnerability, including using prepared statements, input validation, and least privilege database access.
