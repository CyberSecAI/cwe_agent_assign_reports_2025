  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-52388', description='Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Mike Mikeage Miller Hebrew Date allows Stored **XSS**.This issue affects Hebrew Date from n/a through 2.1.0.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'weakness': ['Cross-site scripting', 'XSS'], 'impact': 'Stored XSS', 'vector': '', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'Mike Mikeage Miller Hebrew Date', 'version': 'n/a through 2.1.0', 'component': ''}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**Root Cause:** The WordPress Hebrew Date plugin (versions <= 2.1.0) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks. This means that an attacker can potentially trick a logged-in user into performing actions they didn't intend.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific actions are not mentioned, but it could lead to unauthorized modifications, data changes, or other malicious activities within the plugin's functionality, depending on what actions the plugin enables.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a malicious website, link, or any other method that tricks a logged-in user into sending a crafted request to the vulnerable plugin. This crafted request would be executed with the user's privileges, without their knowledge or consent.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request that, when sent, would be processed by the vulnerable plugin.\\n*   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user to send that request.\\n*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the website; however, they rely on the user being logged in.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n\\n*   The vulnerability is classified as having a low priority, though the CVSS score is 7.1.\\n*   The vulnerability was reported by SOPROBRO.\\n*   A virtual patch is available from Patchstack to mitigate the vulnerability until the plugin is updated to version 2.3.0 or higher.\\n*   The vulnerability is classified under OWASP Top 10 as A1: Broken Access Control.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:Cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:Stored XSS', 'keyphrase': 'Stored XSS', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:Mike Mikeage Miller Hebrew Date', 'keyphrase': 'Mike Mikeage Miller Hebrew Date', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 2.1.0', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 2.1.0', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(271.0312502914254)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '434', 'name': 'Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 2.1.0', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 2.1.0', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(200.25393311484106)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '80', 'name': 'Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:Cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:Stored XSS', 'keyphrase': 'Stored XSS', 'type': 'impact'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(195.46999139934667)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '79', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:Cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:Stored XSS', 'keyphrase': 'Stored XSS', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:Mike Mikeage Miller Hebrew Date', 'keyphrase': 'Mike Mikeage Miller Hebrew Date', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 2.1.0', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 2.1.0', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(192.2867761019581)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
