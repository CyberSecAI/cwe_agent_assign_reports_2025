  "description": "ZITADEL is an open-source identity infrastructure tool. ZITADEL provides users the ability to list all user sessions of the current user agent (browser). Starting in version 2.53.0 and prior to versions 2.53.8, 2.54.5, and 2.55.1, due to a **missing check**, user sessions without that information (e.g. when created though the session service) were incorrectly listed exposing potentially other users sessions. Versions 2.55.1, 2.54.5, and 2.53.8 contain a fix for the issue. There is no workaround since a patch is already available.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-39683:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation in how user sessions were being listed, specifically when retrieving user sessions through the `ListMyUserSessions` API.\n- When the system switched to V2 tokens, the user agent was not correctly set for sessions created through the login UI.\n- Additionally, the `ListMyUserSessions` endpoint was not correctly filtering sessions, and would list any session, even those without a fingerprint ID (e.g., sessions created through the session API).\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Information Leakage:** The primary vulnerability was the exposure of user session data beyond the intended scope, potentially revealing other user's sessions when calling the `ListMyUserSessions` API. This allowed an authenticated user to see sessions that did not belong to their current user agent.\n- **Incorrect User Agent Handling:** The user agent information was not correctly set when creating sessions through the login UI after switching to V2 tokens.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Confidentiality Breach:** An authenticated user could potentially view session information of other users if those sessions were created without a user agent ID or through the session API and were active within the same instance.\n- This could expose potentially sensitive data about other user sessions.\n- It is important to note that this vulnerability did not allow for session takeover.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network by making API calls.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Authentication:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user in the Zitadel instance.\n- **API Access:** An attacker needs the ability to call the `ListMyUserSessions` API endpoint.\n- **User interaction:** Required by the user to log in to exploit the vulnerability\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n- The vulnerability was triggered after a switch to V2 tokens.\n- The issue was present in versions 2.55.0, 2.54.0-2.54.4, and 2.53.0-2.53.7 of Zitadel.\n- Patched versions include 2.55.1, 2.54.5, and 2.53.8.\n\nThe fix involved:\n- Ensuring the correct user agent ID (fingerprint) is used when creating sessions, particularly via the login UI.\n- Ignoring user sessions with empty user agent IDs when listing sessions, thus filtering out sessions that don't belong to the current user agent.",

Since the vulnerability involved a specific case of missing authentication for a critical function (listing user sessions), CWE-306 was chosen over the more general CWE-287. CWE-201 was considered as a potential secondary CWE, representing the exposure of sensitive session data, but it was deemed less directly related to the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe287 secondary\n    class cwe201 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing check** when listing user sessions, leading to the exposure of other user's sessions.\n\n1.  **Missing Check (CWE-306):** The **missing authentication check** when listing user sessions is the root cause.\n2.  **Information Exposure (CWE-201):** The impact is the potential exposure of sensitive information about other user sessions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which was a **missing check** when listing user sessions. The retriever results suggested several CWEs related to authentication and authorization issues. After reviewing the CWE specifications and considering the relationship between CWEs, CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was selected as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **lack of authentication** for a critical function (listing user sessions). CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) was considered as a secondary CWE, representing the exposure of sensitive session data.\n\nThe selection of CWE-306 is primarily based on the vulnerability description's statement about a **missing check** and the CVE reference links content summary indicating that the `ListMyUserSessions` endpoint was not correctly filtering sessions. This aligns with the definition of CWE-306, which states that the product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity.\n\nThe final decision to use CWE-306 is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The selected CWE is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level for mapping root causes.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege
