# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-21972

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net mctp unshare packets when reassembling Ensure that the frag_list used for reassembly isnt shared with other packets. This avoids incorrect reassembly when packets are cloned, and prevents a memory leak due to **circular references between fragments and their skb_shared_info**. The upcoming MCTP-over-USB driver uses skb_clone which can trigger the problem - other MCTP drivers dont share SKBs. A kunit test is added to reproduce the issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** net mctp
- **rootcause:** **circular references between fragments and their skb_shared_info**
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **impact:** incorrect reassembly, memory leak
