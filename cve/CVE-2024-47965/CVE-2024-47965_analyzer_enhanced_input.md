**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within Delta Electronics CNCSoft-G2, which results in a read operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125): The software reads data from a memory location outside of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could lead to a variety of malicious outcomes, such as data breaches, system compromise, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can manipulate a user into visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to induce a user of the affected software (Delta Electronics CNCSoft-G2) to interact with malicious content.
- The attack has low complexity and requires user interaction. The attacker doesn't require special privileges on the system to exploit this issue.
