# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-53103

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved hv_sock Initializing vsk->trans to NULL to prevent a dangling pointer When hvs is released, there is a possibility that **vsk->trans may not be initialized to NULL**, which could lead to a dangling pointer. This issue is resolved by initializing vsk->trans to NULL.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **vsk->trans may not be initialized to NULL**
- **impact:** dangling pointer
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** hv_sock

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a potential dangling pointer in the Hyper-V VSOCK transport driver. When a hyperv_sock (hvs) is released, the associated `vsk->trans` pointer might not be properly initialized to `NULL`. If this pointer is not NULL, it could lead to the use of a dangling pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Dangling pointer: The `vsk->trans` pointer might point to freed memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Use-after-free: Accessing the dangling pointer can lead to a use-after-free condition which can result in unpredictable behavior of the kernel, potentially leading to a system crash, denial of service, or even arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered during the release of a hyperv_sock, specifically when `hvs_destruct` is called.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to trigger the release of a hyperv_sock, which implies having some control over the VSOCK subsystem. This could potentially be achieved from a guest virtual machine.

**Summary of changes:**
The fix involves adding `vsk->trans = NULL;` within the `hvs_destruct` function after `kfree(hvs);`. This ensures that the pointer is always NULL after the memory is freed, preventing a potential dangling pointer.
