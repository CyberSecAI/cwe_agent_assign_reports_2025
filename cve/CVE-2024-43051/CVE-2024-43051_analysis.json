CWE-200 is a class-level CWE, and there might be more specific child CWEs that could be applicable if more information were available. However, based on the limited information provided, CWE-200 is the most suitable choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe200 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause**, which is not explicitly stated in the description, and leads to the **impact**, which is information disclosure.

Although CWE-200 is discouraged as it is a high-level class, the lack of root cause information makes it the most appropriate choice currently.\n\nOther CWEs from the Retriever Results were considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-459 \"Incomplete Cleanup\", CWE-1295 \"Debug Messages Revealing Unnecessary Information\", CWE-330 \"Use of Insufficiently Random Values\", CWE-941 \"Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\", CWE-201 \"Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\", CWE-540 \"Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Source Code\", CWE-1240 \"Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation\", CWE-1291 \"Public Key Re-Use for Signing both Debug and Production Code\", CWE-202 \"Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries\": These CWEs were not selected because they require more specific information about the **root cause** of the vulnerability than is provided in the description.\n\nThe decision to use CWE-200 is based on the explicit mention of information disclosure as the **impact** of the vulnerability.
