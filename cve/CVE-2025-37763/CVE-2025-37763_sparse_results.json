  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/imagination take paired job reference For paired jobs, have the fragment job take a reference on the geometry job, so that the geometry job cannot be freed until the fragment job has finished with it. The geometry job structure is accessed when the fragment job is being prepared by the GPU scheduler. Taking the reference prevents the geometry job being freed until the fragment job no longer requires it.
