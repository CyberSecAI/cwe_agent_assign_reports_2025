# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-4453

## Description

A vulnerability was found in D-Link DIR-619L 2.04B04. It has been classified as critical. This affects the function formSysCmd. The manipulation of the argument sysCmd leads to **command injection**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure. This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Weakness:** command injection
- **Product:** D-Link DIR-619L
- **Version:** 2.04B04
- **Component:** formSysCmd

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-77 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the ChildOf relationship between CWE-78 and CWE-77. CWE-78 is a more specific type of CWE-77. Since the vulnerability specifically mentions OS commands, CWE-78 is more appropriate. Other CWEs were considered based on the retriever results, but they were not as directly relevant as CWE-78 and CWE-77.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of the `sysCmd` argument, which leads to **command injection**.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-78 because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions **command injection** due to the manipulation of the `sysCmd` argument. This aligns with the definition of CWE-78, which focuses on OS commands. The retriever results also listed CWE-78 and CWE-77 as top candidates. While CWE-77 is a parent of CWE-78, the specificity of the vulnerability description makes CWE-78 the more appropriate choice. CWE-77 is a secondary candidate because it represents a broader class of command injection vulnerabilities, and CWE-78 falls under it.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended command when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: CWE-77 is often misused when OS command injection (CWE-78) was intended instead [REF-1287].

## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 588.41
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 514.48
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 575.50
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-426: Untrusted Search Path
**Abstraction Level**: base
**Similarity Score**: 2.77
**Source**: graph

**Description**:
CWE-426: Untrusted Search Path

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

**Relationships**:
- PEEROF -> CWE-428
- PEEROF -> CWE-427
- CHILDOF -> CWE-673
- CHILDOF -> CWE-668
- CHILDOF -> CWE-642

## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 613.94
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
