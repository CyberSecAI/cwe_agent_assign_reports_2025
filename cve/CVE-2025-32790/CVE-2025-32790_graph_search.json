In versions 0.6.8 and prior, a vulnerability was identified in the DIFY AI where normal users are improperly granted permissions to export APP DSL. The feature in /export should only allow administrator users to export DSL. A workaround for this vulnerability involves updating the access control mechanisms to enforce stricter user role permissions and implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only users with admin privileges can export the APP DSL. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.13. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-863 CWE-939 CWE-862 CWE-926 CWE-269 CWE-285 CWE-267 CWE-532",
