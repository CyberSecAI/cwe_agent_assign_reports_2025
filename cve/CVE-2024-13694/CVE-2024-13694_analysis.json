CWE-862 is a Class level weakness and is a parent of CWE-425 and related to CWE-639.

This aligns directly with CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key). The vulnerability description clearly indicates that the **lack of validation** on the user-controlled key is the root cause, which is a form of authorization bypass.\n\nCWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is a broader category, but the specific mechanism of bypassing authorization via a user-controlled key makes CWE-639 more appropriate.
