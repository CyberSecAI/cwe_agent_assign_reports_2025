However, bpf_map_fd_put_ptr() is invoked while holding a bucket lock (raw_spin_lock_t), and bpf_map_free_id() attempts to acquire map_idr_lock (spinlock_t), triggering the following lockdep warning ============================= [ BUG **Invalid wait context** ] 6.11.0-rc4+ #49 Not tainted ----------------------------- test_maps/4881 is trying to lock ffffffff84884578 (map_idr_lock){+...}-{33}, at bpf_map_free_id.part.0+0x21/0x70 other info that might help us debug this context-{55} 2 locks held by test_maps/4881 #0 ffffffff846caf60 (rcu_read_lock){....}-{13}, at bpf_fd_htab_map_update_elem+0xf9/0x270 #1 ffff888149ced148 (&htab->lockdep_key#2){....}-{22}, at htab_map_update_elem+0x178/0xa80 stack backtrace CPU 0 UID 0 PID 4881 Comm test_maps Not tainted 6.11.0-rc4+ #49 Hardware name QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), ...

However, bpf_map_alloc_id() invokes idr_alloc_cyclic() after acquiring map_idr_lock, it will trigger a similar lockdep warning because the slabs lock (s->cpu_slab->lock) is still a spinlock. Instead of changing map_idr_locks type, fix the issue by invoking htab_put_fd_value() after htab_unlock_bucket(). However, only deferring the invocation of htab_put_fd_value() is not enough, because the old map pointers in htab of maps can not be saved during batched deletion. Therefore, also defer the invocation of free_htab_elem(), so these to-be-freed elements could be linked together similar to lru map. There are four callers for ->map_fd_put_ptr (1) alloc_htab_elem() (through htab_put_fd_value()) It invokes ->map_fd_put_ptr() under a raw_spinlock_t. The invocation of htab_put_fd_value() can not simply move after htab_unlock_bucket(), because the old element has already been stashed in htab->extra_elems. It may be reused immediately after htab_unlock_bucket() and the invocation of htab_put_fd_value() after htab_unlock_bucket() may release the newly-added element incorrectly. Therefore, saving the map pointer of the old element for htab of maps before unlocking the bucket and releasing the map_ptr after unlock. Beside the map pointer in the old element, should do the same thing for the special fields in the old element as well. (2) free_htab_elem() (through htab_put_fd_value()) Its caller includes __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_elem(), htab_map_delete_elem() and __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_batch(). For htab_map_delete_elem(), simply invoke free_htab_elem() after htab_unlock_bucket(). For __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_batch(), just like lru map, linking the to-be-freed element into node_to_free list and invoking free_htab_elem() for these element after unlock. It is safe to reuse batch_flink as the link for node_to_free, because these elements have been removed from the hash llist. Because htab of maps doesnt support lookup_and_delete operation, __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_elem() doesnt have the problem, so kept it as ---truncated---",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe root cause lies in a locking conflict within the Linux kernel's BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) subsystem, specifically when dealing with hash table (htab) maps. When a map is removed from a htab, it might hold the last reference to the map. This triggers `bpf_map_fd_put_ptr()`, which then calls `bpf_map_free_id()` to free the map's ID. However, `bpf_map_fd_put_ptr()` is invoked while holding a bucket lock (`raw_spin_lock_t`), and `bpf_map_free_id()` attempts to acquire `map_idr_lock` (a `spinlock_t`). This creates a lock ordering violation leading to a deadlock situation, which is detected by the kernel's lockdep mechanism.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Lock Ordering Violation:** The core issue is the inconsistent locking order, where a raw spinlock is held while attempting to acquire a regular spinlock. This violates lockdep rules and can lead to deadlocks.\n- **Incorrect Resource Release:** The timing of releasing the map resources (`bpf_map_fd_put_ptr()`) was coupled with holding a spinlock. This caused the lockdep warning and could have potentially lead to other race conditions or memory corruption.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Deadlock:** The primary impact is a kernel deadlock. The system will likely hang and become unresponsive, requiring a reboot to recover.\n- **Denial of Service:** This issue effectively causes a denial of service by making the system unusable.\n- **Potential for Other Issues:** Although not stated directly, the text implies that this locking issue might have other race condition or memory corruption consequences due to the incorrect resource release.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **BPF Map Operations:** The attack vector involves manipulating BPF maps, specifically by removing maps from hash tables (`htab`). This can be triggered through the `bpf()` syscall.\n- **Specific Map Type:** The vulnerability is specific to the \"htab of maps\" type.\n- **Specific operations:** The vulnerability is triggered during map removal or update operations\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Ability to use the BPF syscall:** The attacker needs to be able to make use of the `bpf()` system call to create and manipulate BPF maps.\n- **Local Access:** The attacker likely needs local access to the system.\n\n**Mitigation:**\n\nThe patch addresses this by deferring the call to `free_htab_elem()` and `map->ops->map_fd_put_ptr`  until *after* the bucket lock is released (`htab_unlock_bucket()`). This is achieved by saving the old map pointer and special fields before releasing the lock, then freeing them after the lock is released.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n- The fix involves modifying `htab_map_update_elem` and `htab_map_delete_elem`.\n- The patch also changes `__pcpu_freelist_push()` to `pcpu_freelist_push()` to disable interrupts and uses `migrate_disable/enable` around `bpf_mem_cache_free()` calls.\n- The original vulnerability report is for Linux kernel version 6.11.0-rc4+, but the fix appears in stable branches across multiple versions.\n\nThe provided content gives more context and technical detail than the original CVE description typically provides.",
