The document `info.ssh.com_45e2918c_20250624_135533.html` specifically addresses a user impersonation vulnerability in PrivX, identified as CVE-2024-47857.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the vulnerability details extracted from the content:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nInsufficient validation on public key signatures when using native SSH connections via a proxy port.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Improper validation of public key signatures.\n*   Vulnerability exists in PrivX versions between 18.0-36.0.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAn attacker can impersonate another PrivX user (\"account B\") and gain access to SSH target hosts to which \"account B\" has access.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Attacker must be a PrivX user (\"account A\") or possess a private key registered for \"account A\".\n*   Attacker must be able to connect to `ssh-mitm` through the proxy port (1080) using HTTP connect or SOCKS5/4a.\n*   Attacker must have knowledge of a public key registered for the target user (\"account B\").\n*   Attacker needs an SSH client and specific knowledge.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Existing PrivX user or possession of a valid private key for a PrivX user.\n*   Network access to the PrivX proxy port.\n*   Knowledge of the Secure Shell protocol and PrivX implementation.\n*   Knowledge of the target user's public key.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade PrivX to version 35.3, 36.1, 37.0 or later.\n*   If upgrading is not immediately possible, block the proxy port (1080) on PrivX nodes if the feature of connecting with a native ssh client via ProxyCommand is not used.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The vulnerability was discovered through an internal code review.\n*   The CVE score is 5.5 (Medium).\n*   Attack complexity is high.\n*   SSH web client based connections are not affected.\n*   Native SSH client connections that do not use ProxyCommand are also unaffected.",

The evidence for this mapping is strong, with the vulnerability description explicitly stating this weakness. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further supports this by highlighting the root cause as \"Insufficient validation on public key signatures when using native SSH connections via a proxy port.\"\n\nCWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing is included as a secondary CWE, as it represents the immediate consequence of the improper signature verification.
