  "description": "A security vulnerability has been identified in Bludit, allowing attackers with knowledge of the API token to upload arbitrary files through the File API which leads to arbitrary code execution on the server. This vulnerability arises from **improper handling of file uploads**, enabling malicious actors to upload and execute PHP files.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-24550:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n- The Bludit File API has an undocumented file upload feature that lacks proper file type checking (neither extension nor MIME type are verified).\n-  Uploaded files are stored directly within the web root, making them accessible to anyone.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The API allows uploading of arbitrary file types.\n- **Lack of File Type Validation:** No checks are performed on the uploaded file's extension or MIME type.\n- **Insecure Storage Location:** Uploaded files are placed directly under the web root.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can upload and execute malicious PHP code (e.g., a web shell).\n- **Arbitrary Command Execution:**  After uploading a PHP web shell, an attacker (even unauthenticated users) can execute commands on the server.\n- **Complete System Compromise:**  Successful exploitation could lead to a full compromise of the web server.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n- **API Exploitation:** Attackers can exploit the undocumented File API upload feature.\n- **Direct File Access:**  Uploaded files can be accessed directly through their URL since they are located under the web root.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n- **Knowledge of API Token:** The attacker needs to obtain a valid API token.\n- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the Bludit server.\n- **API Enabled**: The Bludit administrator must have enabled the API\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is present in the code committed about 4 years ago.\n*   The exploit code provided shows how to obtain the UUID and upload a shell.php file which then allows for executing commands via a `cmd` parameter.\n*   The vulnerability affects all versions of Bludit since 3.14.0.\n*   The file upload feature is not documented, suggesting it may not be intended for public use.\n*   The advisory recommends removing the file upload API or implementing an allowlist for allowed file types.",

The vulnerability involves uploading files directly into the web root without proper checks, which can lead to path traversal if the filename is manipulated. Also, the file upload leads to code execution.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe23[\"CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\"]\n    \n    cwe23 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe434 primary\n    class cwe22 secondary\n    class cwe23 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of file uploads** (CWE-434), which, combined with the files being stored in the web root, allows for arbitrary code execution.
