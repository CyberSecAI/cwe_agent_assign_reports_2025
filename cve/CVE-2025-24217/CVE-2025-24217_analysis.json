There wasn't a strong hierarchical or chain relationship applicable here. The other CWEs considered didn't directly address the **improper redaction** of sensitive information, which is the core issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe212 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain here is relatively simple:\n1.  Sensitive information is present.\n2.  The **product fails to properly redact** this information before access by an application.\n3.  An application gains access to sensitive user data.\n\nThe root cause is the **improper redaction**, and the impact is unauthorized data access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary driver for selecting CWE-212 was the direct match to the description: \"**This issue was addressed with improved redaction of sensitive information.**\" The weakness lies in the product's **failure to properly remove sensitive information** before it could be accessed by an unauthorized entity (an app). This directly aligns with CWE-212.\n\nThe other CWEs were considered but rejected. For example, CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and similar memory corruption issues are not relevant given the description focuses on information redaction. CWE-843 (Type Confusion) and CWE-415 (Double Free) are also unrelated to information redaction. CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) could be considered as a secondary issue, but the primary problem is with the redaction process itself, not necessarily the authorization controls.\n\nI am relying on the evidence that the **redaction of sensitive information** was improved. The evidence is not very strong, hence the Confidence Score of 0.7.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
