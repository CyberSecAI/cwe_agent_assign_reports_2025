## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-48141:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a prompt injection flaw within the chatbox of the CodeGeeX AI coding assistant. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize or handle user input in the chat, allowing malicious prompts to be interpreted as commands, leading to unintended actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prompt Injection:** The core weakness is the application's susceptibility to prompt injection. This means that an attacker can inject malicious instructions within a seemingly normal chat message.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application lacks proper sanitization or validation of user input provided to the chatbox. This allows the injected code to be executed as part of the normal chat processing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exfiltration:** A successful attack allows an attacker to access and exfiltrate all previous and subsequent chat data between the user and the AI assistant. This includes potentially sensitive code snippets, prompts, and generated code.
- **Persistent Data Leakage:** The data leakage is persistent, meaning that once the malicious prompt is injected, all subsequent conversations are also at risk of being exfiltrated.
- **Information Disclosure:**  The vulnerability leads to the disclosure of sensitive information that users might be sharing with the AI assistant.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted Chat Prompt:** An attacker crafts a specific chat message containing malicious instructions.
- **Chatbox Input:** This malicious prompt is entered into the chatbox of the CodeGeeX application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the Application:** The attacker needs access to the CodeGeeX application's chat interface, either via their own instance or by tricking a victim to inject the malicious code into a shared instance.
- **Ability to Enter Text:** The attacker must be able to type or paste text into the chat input field.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Version:** The vulnerability is confirmed to exist in CodeGeeX v2.17.0.
- **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The PoC involves injecting a crafted prompt into the chat window. The prompt is designed to exfiltrate all previous and future chat content to an attacker-controlled server.
- **Discovery:**  The vulnerability was discovered by Sourajeet Majumder in October 2024.
