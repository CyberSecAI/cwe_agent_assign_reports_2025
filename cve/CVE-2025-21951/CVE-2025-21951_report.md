# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-21951

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bus mhi host pci_generic Use pci_try_reset_function() to avoid **deadlock** There are multiple places from where the recovery work gets scheduled asynchronously. Also, there are multiple places where the caller waits synchronously for the recovery to be completed. One such place is during the PM shutdown() callback. If the device is not alive during recovery_work, it will try to reset the device using pci_reset_function(). This function internally will take the device_lock() first before resetting the device. By this time, if the lock has already been acquired, then recovery_work will get stalled while waiting for the lock. And if the lock was already acquired by the caller which waits for the recovery_work to be completed, it will lead to **deadlock**. This is what happened on the X1E80100 CRD device when the device died before shutdown() callback. Driver core calls the drivers shutdown() callback while holding the device_lock() leading to **deadlock**. And this **deadlock** scenario can occur on other paths as well, like during the PM suspend() callback, where the driver core would hold the device_lock() before calling drivers suspend() callback. And if the recovery_work was already started, it could lead to **deadlock**. This is also observed on the X1E80100 CRD. So to fix both issues, use pci_try_reset_function() in recovery_work. This function first checks for the availability of the device_lock() before trying to reset the device. If the lock is available, it will acquire it and reset the device. Otherwise, it will return -EAGAIN. If that happens, recovery_work will fail with the error message Recovery failed as not much could be done.

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-833 | Deadlock | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the issue leads to a deadlock. |
| CWE-667 | Improper Locking | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate. The **device_lock() acquired before resetting the device** is the root cause for the deadlock. |
| CWE-362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate. The **device_lock() acquired before resetting the device** during asynchronous calls could lead to a Race Condition. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis

The primary weakness is CWE-833, Deadlock, which occurs due to improper locking mechanisms. CWE-667, Improper Locking, is a class-level CWE that describes the general issue of not properly acquiring or releasing a lock. CWE-362, Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'), is another related class-level CWE that highlights the risk of concurrent code accessing shared resources without proper synchronization, leading to a race condition and potentially a deadlock.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with the **device_lock() acquired before resetting the device**, leading to a potential race condition due to asynchronous calls and finally resulting in a **deadlock**.
- Root Cause: **device_lock() acquired before resetting the device**
- Weakness: Asynchronous calls create a race condition
- Impact: **Deadlock**

## Summary of Analysis

The primary assessment is based on the explicit mention of "**deadlock**" in the vulnerability description. The description details a scenario where the `device_lock()` is acquired by different execution paths, leading to a deadlock when one path waits for the lock held by another.

The relationships in the graph influenced the selection by highlighting how improper locking and concurrent execution can lead to deadlocks. The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-833 directly represents the vulnerability, while CWE-667 and CWE-362 explain the underlying causes.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-833: Deadlock
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Base
