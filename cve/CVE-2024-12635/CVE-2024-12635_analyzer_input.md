# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-12635

## Vulnerability Description
The WP Docs plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the dir_id parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.0 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 2.2.0.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**
- **weakness:** **SQL injection**
- **impact:** extract sensitive information from the database and extract sensitive information from database and time-based SQL injection
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers
- **product:** WP Docs WordPress plugin
- **version:** all versions up to and including 2.2.0
- **component:** dir_id parameter

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-12635:

**1. Verification:**

*   The provided content from Wordfence and WordPress Plugin Trac clearly relates to **CVE-2024-12635**, detailing a SQL Injection vulnerability in the WP Docs plugin.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause lies in the insufficient sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input (`dir_id` parameter) used in SQL queries.
*   The plugin fails to properly use prepared statements or parameterized queries, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into database queries, leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized actions.
*   **Time-Based SQL Injection:** The specific type of SQL injection is time-based, where the attacker infers information based on delays introduced by the injected SQL code.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The plugin does not adequately validate or sanitize the `dir_id` parameter before using it in SQL queries.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive data from the database by crafting malicious queries.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers may be able to bypass authorization checks and gain access to restricted resources.
*   **Database Modification:** Though not specified, attackers could potentially modify or delete data by injecting appropriate SQL commands.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerability is exposed through the `dir_id` parameter, likely via an HTTP GET request.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have at least a Subscriber role or higher to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **Knowledge of SQL Injection:** Attackers need to have knowledge of time-based SQL injection techniques to construct the exploit payload.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was partially patched in version 2.2.0, suggesting that some mitigation, but not a complete fix, was implemented in that version.
*   The fix included the use of `$wpdb->prepare()` to properly sanitize input within the SQL queries.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Arkadiusz Hydzik and reported via the Wordfence Bug Bounty Program.
