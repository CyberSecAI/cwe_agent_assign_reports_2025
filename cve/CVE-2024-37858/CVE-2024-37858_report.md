```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **SQL Injection** (**weakness**) due to **improper neutralization of special elements**, leading to privilege escalation (**impact**) when exploited through the `id` parameter.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly states "**SQL Injection** vulnerability" and indicates that this leads to privilege escalation. The provided retriever results strongly suggest CWE-89 as the primary weakness, which aligns with the vulnerability description. The evidence is strong, since the vulnerability description calls out "**SQL Injection**" as the **weakness**.
