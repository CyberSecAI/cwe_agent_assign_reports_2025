# Analysis for CVE-2025-24373

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-425 | Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key), which is a **Base** level CWE. This is appropriate because the vulnerability involves manipulating a URL parameter (`my-account` to `bulk`) to bypass authorization and access sensitive documents. CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')) is included as a secondary CWE because it generally describes accessing restricted URLs without proper authorization, which is related to the URL manipulation aspect of the vulnerability. CWE-639 is more specific because it calls out the user-controlled key aspect which is present in the vulnerability. Both are base level.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect authorization** mechanism in the plugin, where it does not properly validate the `my-account` URL parameter. This leads to the **authorization bypass** by manipulating the parameter to `bulk`, and ultimately results in **unauthorized access** to PDF documents and a compromise of confidentiality.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly indicates an **authorization bypass** issue where unauthorized users can access PDF documents by manipulating a URL parameter. The primary evidence for this lies in the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary," which states: "Root cause of vulnerability: Replacing the URL variable `my-account` with `bulk`... Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Unrestricted access to PDF documents via URL manipulation... Impact of exploitation: Unauthorized users can access any PDF document from a store. Compromises the confidentiality of sensitive documents." The choice of CWE-639 is supported by this evidence, as it directly addresses the **authorization bypass** through a user-controlled key (the URL parameter). The retriever results also support this choice, with CWE-639 being listed as a relevant candidate.

CWE-425 is also relevant, as the **forced browsing** aspect comes into play when users directly request restricted URLs. The relationship between these CWEs is that CWE-639 is a more specific instance of the broader CWE-425. Both are base level CWEs.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately capture the root cause and mechanism of the vulnerability without being overly broad or abstract.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
