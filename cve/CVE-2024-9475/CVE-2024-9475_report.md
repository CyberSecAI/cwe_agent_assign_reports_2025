# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-9475

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-9475

## Description

The Poll Maker - Versus Polls, Anonymous Polls, Image Polls plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to generic SQL Injection via the order_by parameter in all versions up to, and including, 5.4.6 due to **insufficient escaping** on the user-supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** insufficient escaping
- **Weakness:** SQL injection
- **Impact:** extract sensitive information from the database
- **Attacker:** authenticated attackers with admin privileges
- **Product:** Poll Maker - Versus Polls
- **Version:** up to and including 5.4.6
- **Component:** order_by parameter

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing my decision is that CWE-89 is a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')). However, CWE-89 is much more specific, directly addressing SQL Injection, which aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the primary mapping.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient escaping** of the `order_by` parameter, leading directly to **SQL Injection**. This allows attackers to extract sensitive information from the database. The chain is:
1.  **CWE-89** (**Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')**) - Root cause due to insufficient escaping.
2.  Information Disclosure (Impact)

## Summary of Analysis
My analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The vulnerability description clearly states that the root cause is **insufficient escaping** on the user-supplied `order_by` parameter, leading to **SQL Injection**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, highlighting the insufficient sanitization of the `order_by` parameter and the resulting ability to inject malicious SQL code.

The retriever results further support this, with CWE-89 having a perfect score of 1.0. Given the specific nature of the vulnerability and the overwhelming evidence, CWE-89 is the most appropriate and specific CWE.

Other CWEs were considered but ultimately not selected because they were either too general (e.g., CWE-74, CWE-285) or did not directly address the specific type of injection vulnerability (e.g., CWE-79, CWE-90).

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
