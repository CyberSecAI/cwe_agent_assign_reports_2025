  "description": "Discourse is an open-source community platform. A data leak vulnerability affects sites deployed between commits 10df7fdee060d44accdee7679d66d778d1136510 and 82d84af6b0efbd9fa2aeec3e91ce7be1a768511b. On login-required sites, the leak meant that some content on the sites homepage could be visible to unauthenticated users. Only login-required sites that got deployed during this timeframe are affected, roughly between April 30 2025 noon EDT and May 2 2025, noon EDT. Sites on the stable branch are unaffected. Private content on an instances homepage could be visible to unauthenticated users on login-required sites. Versions of 3.5.0.beta4 after commit 82d84af6b0efbd9fa2aeec3e91ce7be1a768511b are not vulnerable to the issue. No workarounds are available. Sites must upgrade to a non-vulnerable version of Discourse.",

CWE-201, CWE-538, and CWE-425 are related in that they describe different ways sensitive information can be exposed or accessed. CWE-359 is a base-level CWE, offering a good balance between specificity and generality, accurately capturing the vulnerability's nature. The other CWEs considered represent alternative or contributing factors to the primary issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe538[\"CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n\n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe359\n    cwe538 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe359\n    cwe425 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe359\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe359 primary\n    class cwe201,cwe538,cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **data leak** due to some unspecified coding error (not enough details to map to a specific CWE). The **impact** is private content being visible to unauthenticated users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence. The vulnerability description clearly states a **data leak** where private content is exposed to unauthenticated users. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" reinforces this by mentioning \"A data leak, where some content on the site's homepage could be visible to unauthenticated users on login-required sites\" and \"Private content on an instance's homepage could be visible to unauthenticated users on login-required sites\".\n\nCWE-359 directly addresses this issue: \"The product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.\" This aligns well with the **data leak** making private content visible to unauthenticated users.\n\nThe graph relationships show how other CWEs could relate, but CWE-359 is the most direct and specific representation of the **data leak** vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-359 being a base-level CWE that accurately reflects the vulnerability's root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
