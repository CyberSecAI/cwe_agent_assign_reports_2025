## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Skip To Plugin (versions <= 2.0.0) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability allowing attackers to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a CSRF attack, where a malicious user crafts a request that, when executed by an authenticated user, performs an action on their behalf.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a higher privileged user into executing a malicious request. This would likely require the attacker to know the structure of the vulnerable requests and be able to somehow get the user to perform those requests while authenticated to the WordPress site. An unauthenticated attacker is sufficient in terms of authentication, however, they will need to socially engineer a user into completing the request.
