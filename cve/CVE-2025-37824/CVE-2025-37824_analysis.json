There are also CANFOLLOW and CANPRECEDE relationships to CWE-476, but those are not applicable in this simple case. The base level of abstraction is correct.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe476 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward: a **NULL pointer dereference** leads to a general protection fault and Oops in the Linux kernel. The root cause is the **NULL pointer dereference**, and the impact is a system crash.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the explicit statement in the vulnerability description key phrases: \"**rootcause:** **NULL pointer dereference**\". This directly maps to CWE-476, \"NULL Pointer Dereference\". The retriever results also list CWE-476 as the top candidate with a high score.
