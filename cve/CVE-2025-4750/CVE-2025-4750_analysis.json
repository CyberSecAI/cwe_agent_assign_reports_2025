No child or parent relationships influenced this decision due to the lack of sufficient evidence.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe497 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is simple: **improper** handling of configuration data leads to information disclosure. The description indicates that a remote attacker can access `/H5/get_version.data` and obtain sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the information disclosure vulnerability. Given the limited information, the best fit is CWE-497, \"Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\". This CWE accurately describes the scenario where sensitive system information is exposed to unauthorized actors due to **improper** access controls or handling of the data.\n\nThe \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" indicate the **impact** is \"information disclosure\" due to some **improper** processing of `/H5/get_version.data`. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary is \"UNRELATED\", so there is no more information.\n\nCWE-497 is a base level CWE, which aligns with the goal of selecting the most specific CWE possible.\n\nOther CWEs Considered and Rejected:\n\n*   CWE-79, CWE-89, CWE-117, CWE-78, CWE-93: These CWEs relate to injection vulnerabilities, which are not indicated in the description. There is no mention of input being improperly neutralized.\n*   CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment. While related to security, there is nothing indicating incorrect privilege assignment.\n*   CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'). Although this could be a contributing factor, it doesn't precisely capture the **root cause**, which is the exposure of sensitive information.\n*   CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions is too generic.\n*   CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements is not appropriate, since there is no filtering occurring.\n\nI am overriding the Retriever Results because the description indicates information disclosure is the end result and there is no evidence of injection.",
