CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is a base CWE that can result from various coding errors. CWE-390 (Detection of Error Condition Without Action) can precede a memory corruption issue, such as an out-of-bounds write, if an error is detected but not handled correctly, potentially leading to the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe390[\"CWE-390: Detection of Error Condition Without Action\"]\n    cwe755[\"CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n\n    cwe787 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe476\n    cwe390 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    cwe390 -- CHILDOF --> cwe755\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe390 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect error handling**, which leads to a detected error condition without action, ultimately resulting in **memory corruption** (Out-of-bounds Write) and remote denial of service.\n\nIncorrect Error Handling -> Error Condition Detected Without Action (CWE-390) -> Memory Corruption (CWE-787) -> Remote Denial of Service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary weakness, as stated in the vulnerability description, is **memory corruption** due to **incorrect error handling**. The Retriever Results also suggest CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as the top candidate. The evidence supporting CWE-787 is strong due to the explicit mention of memory corruption. The mention of **incorrect error handling** led to the inclusion of CWE-390 because the error handling was insufficient and didn't prevent memory corruption.\n\nCWE-787 is at the optimal level of specificity, being a base CWE that accurately describes the out-of-bounds write leading to memory corruption.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
