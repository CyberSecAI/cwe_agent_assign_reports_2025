  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ALSA ump Fix buffer overflow at UMP SysEx message conversion The conversion function from MIDI 1.0 to UMP packet contains an internal buffer to keep the incoming MIDI bytes, and its size is 4, as it was supposed to be the max size for a MIDI1 UMP packet data. However, the implementation overlooked that SysEx is handled in a different format, and it can be up to 6 bytes, as found in do_convert_to_ump(). It leads eventually to a buffer overflow, and may corrupt the memory when a longer SysEx message is received. The fix is simply to extend the buffer size to 6 to fit with the SysEx UMP message.",
