  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ALSA ump Fix **buffer overflow** at UMP SysEx message conversion The conversion function from MIDI 1.0 to UMP packet contains an internal buffer to keep the incoming MIDI bytes, and its size is 4, as it was supposed to be the max size for a MIDI1 UMP packet data. However, the **implementation overlooked that SysEx is handled in a different format**, and it can be up to 6 bytes, as found in do_convert_to_ump(). It leads eventually to a **buffer overflow**, and may corrupt the memory when a longer SysEx message is received. The fix is simply to extend the buffer size to 6 to fit with the SysEx UMP message.",

CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size is a related weakness because the code copies data into the buffer without proper size checks, exacerbating the risk of overflow. CWE-131 Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size is also relevant, as the root cause involves an oversight that led to the buffer being too small for certain SysEx messages.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size\"]\n    cwe131[\"CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe131 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    cwe131 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe120,cwe131 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **implementation overlooking that SysEx is handled in a different format** (potentially leading to CWE-131), which causes an incorrect buffer size. Then, during the conversion from MIDI 1.0 to UMP packet, a longer SysEx message is received and written into the undersized buffer without proper size checking (CWE-120), resulting in a **buffer overflow** (CWE-787) that corrupts memory.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **buffer overflow** and its root cause. The evidence clearly indicates that the implementation **overlooked that SysEx is handled in a different format**, leading to the buffer being too small. The vulnerability description mentions \"buffer overflow\" and \"corrupt the memory\", supporting the selection of CWE-787 as the primary weakness.\n\nThe relationship analysis highlights the connections between the different weaknesses involved. CWE-120 and CWE-131 contribute to the overflow condition.\n\nThe final selection prioritizes CWE-787 as the most specific representation of the vulnerability's impact (out-of-bounds write). CWE-120 and CWE-131 are included as contributing factors that led to this overflow. The abstraction levels are chosen to be as specific as possible, with all selected CWEs being at the Base level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary.
