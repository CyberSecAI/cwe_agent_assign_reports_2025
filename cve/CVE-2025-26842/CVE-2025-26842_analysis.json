CWE-359 and CWE-312 are potential secondary weaknesses related to the exposure of personal information and its storage. These have a peer relationship with CWE-201, representing related but distinct aspects of the vulnerability. CWE-201 is at the Base level, which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe201 -- CANALSOBE --> cwe359\n    cwe201 -- CANALSOBE --> cwe312\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe359,cwe312 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insertion of sensitive information (decrypted S/MIME email content) into the communication log (CWE-201)**. This leads to the potential **exposure of private personal information to unauthorized actors (CWE-359)** and the **cleartext storage of sensitive information (CWE-312)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is the **insertion of sensitive information into the communication log (CWE-201)**. This is supported by the CVE analysis, which states: \"The decrypted content of S/MIME emails is stored in the communication log.\" The impact is that \"users who have access to the communication log can view the decrypted content of S/MIME emails.\" This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-201: \"The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\"\n\nCWE-359 (Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a potential secondary weakness, as the decrypted emails may contain private personal information. The vulnerability description mentions \"S/MIME encrypted e-mail messages,\" which suggests the potential for exposure of personal data.\n\nCWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) could also be a secondary weakness because the decrypted content is stored without encryption.\n\nThe retriever results also suggest CWE-201 as a relevant CWE. The abstraction level for CWE-201 is Base, which is the preferred level.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') - This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability does not involve improper neutralization of input.\n*   CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key - This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is not related to authorization bypass.\n*   CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter - This CWE is not relevant because it does not relate to controlling web parameters.\n*   CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm - This CWE is not relevant because the issue is not with the cryptographic algorithm itself, but with how decrypted data is handled.\n*   CWE-226: Sensitive Information in Resource Not Removed Before Reuse - This CWE is not the primary weakness, but a potential result of the initial weakness.",
