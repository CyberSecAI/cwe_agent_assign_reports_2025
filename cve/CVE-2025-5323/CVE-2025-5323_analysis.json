  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in fossasia open-event-server 1.19.1. This issue affects the function send_email_change_user_email of the file /fossasia/open-event-server/blob/development/app/api/helpers/mail.py of the component Mail Verification Handler. The manipulation leads to **reliance on obfuscation or encryption of security-relevant inputs without integrity checking**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

This allows attackers to craft verification tokens.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:\n    *   Encryption Oracle\n    *   Secret key reuse\n    *   Encryption scheme reuse\n    *   Email verification bypass\n*   **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can verify arbitrary email addresses, potentially allowing them to take over accounts or gain unauthorized access.\n*   **Attack vectors**: An attacker can register an account with a target email, change the email to their own, obtain an email change token, then change the email back to the target email and use the token to construct a valid email verification link.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to register an account and change the email address associated with it.\n*   **Mitigation or fix**:\n    *   Use different secret keys for different cryptographic operations.\n    *   Add a unique salt to different cryptographic operations.",

CWE-303 is a base-level weakness describing incorrect implementation of an authentication algorithm. There are no direct parent-child relationships between these CWEs. CWE-319, also a base-level weakness, represents the risk of transmitting sensitive information in cleartext if encryption is not properly implemented with integrity checks. The selection of CWE-649 is based on the explicit mention of **reliance on obfuscation or encryption of security-relevant inputs without integrity checking** in the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe649[\"CWE-649: Reliance on Obfuscation or Encryption of Security-Relevant Inputs without Integrity Checking\"]\n    cwe303[\"CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe649 primary\n    class cwe303,cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **reliance on obfuscation or encryption of security-relevant inputs without integrity checking** (CWE-649). If the authentication algorithm is incorrectly implemented (CWE-303), it could lead to sensitive information being transmitted in cleartext (CWE-319).\nCWE-649 -> CWE-303 -> CWE-319\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary, which highlights the **reliance on obfuscation or encryption of security-relevant inputs without integrity checking** as the root cause. The selection is further supported by the provided retriever results, where CWE-649 is listed as a relevant CWE. The relationships with other CWEs, like CWE-303 and CWE-319, provide additional context to the potential impact of the vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-649 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the core issue of relying on encryption without integrity checking. The vulnerability description key phrases clearly indicate this weakness, making it the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe
