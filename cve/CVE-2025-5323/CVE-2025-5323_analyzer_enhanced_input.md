## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in fossasia open-event-server 1.19.1. This issue affects the function send_email_change_user_email of the file /fossasia/open-event-server/blob/development/app/api/helpers/mail.py of the component Mail Verification Handler. The manipulation leads to **reliance on obfuscation or encryption of security-relevant inputs without integrity checking**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **reliance on obfuscation or encryption of security-relevant inputs without integrity checking**
- **product:** fossasia open-event-server
- **version:** 1.19.1
- **component:** Mail Verification Handler

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's an analysis of the provided content based on the instructions:

The content from the provided gist.github.com URLs describes a vulnerability related to email verification bypass in the Open Event Server due to an encryption oracle attack.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Open Event Server uses the same secret key and encryption scheme (HMAC-SHA1) for both email change tokens and email verification tokens. This allows attackers to craft verification tokens.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   Encryption Oracle
    *   Secret key reuse
    *   Encryption scheme reuse
    *   Email verification bypass
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can verify arbitrary email addresses, potentially allowing them to take over accounts or gain unauthorized access.
*   **Attack vectors**: An attacker can register an account with a target email, change the email to their own, obtain an email change token, then change the email back to the target email and use the token to construct a valid email verification link.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to register an account and change the email address associated with it.
*   **Mitigation or fix**:
    *   Use different secret keys for different cryptographic operations.
    *   Add a unique salt to different cryptographic operations.
