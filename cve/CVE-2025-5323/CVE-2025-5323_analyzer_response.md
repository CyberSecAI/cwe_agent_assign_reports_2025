# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-5323

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-649 | Reliance on Obfuscation or Encryption of Security-Relevant Inputs without Integrity Checking | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability stems from relying on encryption without ensuring the integrity of the encrypted data. |
| CWE-303 | Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE: The vulnerability description includes the use of HMAC-SHA1 for encryption, which can be used to detect an authentication algorithm implementation. |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE: Sensitive data could be transmitted in cleartext if relying solely on encryption without integrity checks. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-649, a base-level weakness describing reliance on obfuscation or encryption without integrity checking. CWE-303 is a base-level weakness describing incorrect implementation of an authentication algorithm. There are no direct parent-child relationships between these CWEs. CWE-319, also a base-level weakness, represents the risk of transmitting sensitive information in cleartext if encryption is not properly implemented with integrity checks. The selection of CWE-649 is based on the explicit mention of **reliance on obfuscation or encryption of security-relevant inputs without integrity checking** in the vulnerability description.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **reliance on obfuscation or encryption of security-relevant inputs without integrity checking** (CWE-649). If the authentication algorithm is incorrectly implemented (CWE-303), it could lead to sensitive information being transmitted in cleartext (CWE-319).
CWE-649 -> CWE-303 -> CWE-319

## Summary of Analysis
The primary assessment is based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary, which highlights the **reliance on obfuscation or encryption of security-relevant inputs without integrity checking** as the root cause. The selection is further supported by the provided retriever results, where CWE-649 is listed as a relevant CWE. The relationships with other CWEs, like CWE-303 and CWE-319, provide additional context to the potential impact of the vulnerability.

The selection of CWE-649 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the core issue of relying on encryption without integrity checking. The vulnerability description key phrases clearly indicate this weakness, making it the most appropriate CWE for this vulnerability.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
