# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-6612

## Vulnerability Description
**CSP violations** generated links in the console tab of the developer tools, pointing to the violating resource. This caused a DNS prefetch which leaked that a CSP violation happened. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 128 and Thunderbird < 128.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **CSP violations**
- **impact:** DNS prefetch
- **product:** Firefox, Thunderbird
- **version:** < 128

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6612:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way CSP (Content Security Policy) violations are handled in the developer tools console. Specifically, when a CSP violation occurs, the developer console generates a link pointing to the violating resource. This link triggers a DNS prefetch.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information leakage:** The DNS prefetch action leaks the fact that a CSP violation occurred to the DNS server, potentially revealing sensitive information about the user's browsing activity and the resources being accessed.
- **Privacy violation:** The prefetch can reveal information about the user's browsing activity, which the user might not expect to be shared, especially in cases of cross-site requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Low Impact:** The primary impact is a leakage of information about CSP violations. This alone might not lead to direct exploitation such as arbitrary code execution or data theft.
- **Potential reconnaissance:** An attacker could potentially use this information to gain insights into a target website's structure and resources. However, this is limited by the information exposed via the DNS prefetch.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Website visit:** The user must visit a website that generates CSP violations for the vulnerability to be triggered.
- **Developer tools use:** The user must have the developer tools console open for the vulnerability to be observed and the DNS prefetch to be triggered.
- **Cross-site request:** The vulnerability is triggered by a cross-site request that violates the CSP.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Attacker controls the content:** The attacker needs control over the content of a website or a component that is loaded by the browser and able to trigger CSP violations. This control may not be full control, and may only involve crafting specific network requests.
- **No special network position:** The attacker does not need to be a man-in-the-middle or be positioned in a privileged network position. The vulnerability can be triggered by a normal browser request.

**Additional Notes**
- The bug report for the mentioned bug ID 1880374 is not accessible to the general public.
- The vulnerability is related to how a browser (specifically Firefox/Thunderbird) handles CSP violations in its developer tools, thus it's specific to a development environment or when debugging.
