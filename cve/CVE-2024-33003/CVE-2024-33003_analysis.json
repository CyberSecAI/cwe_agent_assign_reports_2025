While CWE-200 is a broader category, the specifics of using GET requests with sensitive query strings make CWE-598 a more precise fit. The chain relationship here involves sensitive data being included in the request, leading to its exposure. The abstraction levels influenced the choice to go with the more specific Variant, CWE-598, over the Class, CWE-200.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe598[\"CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe598 -->|CHILDOF| cwe201\n    cwe201 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe598 primary\n    class cwe201,cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **weakness** of including PII in request URLs. This leads to the exposure of sensitive information.\n  - **Root Cause:** Inclusion of PII in request URL as query or path parameters\n  - **Weakness:** CWE-598 (Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings)\n  - **Impact:** High impact on confidentiality and integrity of the application\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed towards CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor), but further review showed that CWE-598 (Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings) is a more precise mapping. The vulnerability description explicitly states that PII data is included in the request URL as query or path parameters, which aligns perfectly with the characteristics of CWE-598. The retriever results also list CWE-598.\n\nThe decision to use CWE-598 is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description: \"Some OCC API endpoints in SAP Commerce Cloud allows Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data, such as passwords, email addresses, mobile numbers, coupon codes, and voucher codes, to be included in the request URL as query or path parameters.\" This directly indicates the use of GET requests (or similar methods where parameters are part of the URL) with sensitive query strings.\n\nCWE-200 was considered but deemed too general.
