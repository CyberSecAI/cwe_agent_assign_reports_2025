CWE-122 is a specific type of buffer overflow. This suggests a chain relationship where the integer overflow **incorrectly** calculates a size, which subsequently causes a buffer overflow in the heap.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe131[\"CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\"]\n\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe131\n    cwe131 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe122\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe122,cwe131 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow** (CWE-190), which then leads to **heap corruption**, most likely by an **incorrect calculation of the buffer size** (CWE-131) and subsequently a **heap-based buffer overflow** (CWE-122).\n\nCWE-190 (Root Cause) -> CWE-131 (Missing Link) -> CWE-122 (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis correctly identifies the **integer overflow** as the root cause (CWE-190). The subsequent **heap corruption** is best represented as a **heap-based buffer overflow** (CWE-122), as this is the most likely outcome of an **integer overflow** when allocating memory. The evidence supports the selection of CWE-190 as the primary cause.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states: \"**Integer overflow** in Skia in Google Chrome prior to 132.0.6834.83 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit **heap corruption** via a crafted HTML page.\"\n\nThe relationship graph influenced the selection by highlighting the chain of events, specifically the potential for an integer overflow to lead to a buffer overflow. CWE-190 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **integer overflow** condition. CWE-122 is also at the optimal level by describing **heap corruption** as a **heap-based buffer overflow**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
