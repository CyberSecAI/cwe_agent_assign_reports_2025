- **weakness:** **unrestricted upload**
- **vector:** manipulation of File argument
- **product:** feng_ha_ha/megagao ssm-erp and production_ssm
- **version:** 1
- **component:** uploadPicture in PictureServiceImpl.java

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-4768 Content

Based on the provided content, this report details a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the `production_ssm` project (versions available on GitHub and Gitee).

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient file validation in the picture upload functionality. Specifically, the `PictureServiceImpl.java` file does not filter or process the file name, allowing the upload of malicious script files (JSP packages).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows uploading files without proper validation of their type or content.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The file name is directly concatenated with the save path without sanitization.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**

An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server hosting the `production_ssm` application.

**Attack vectors:**

1.  Install and configure the application.
2.  Access the `/pic/upload` route.
3.  Upload a malicious JSP package.
4.  Access the path of the uploaded malicious plugin to execute arbitrary commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

The attacker needs to be able to access the `/pic/upload` endpoint of the application. No authentication is explicitly mentioned as a requirement in the provided content.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The suggested mitigation is to implement a whitelist for allowed file suffixes during the upload process. This would prevent the upload of potentially malicious script files.

**Additional Details (compared to a hypothetical CVE description):**

The provided content offers significantly more detail than a standard CVE description would. It includes:

*   Specific file names and classes involved (`PictureServiceImpl.java`, `PictureController.java`).
*   Detailed steps for reproduction.
*   Screenshots illustrating the vulnerability and exploitation process.
*   Links to the affected repositories on GitHub and Gitee.
*   Specific code locations.
