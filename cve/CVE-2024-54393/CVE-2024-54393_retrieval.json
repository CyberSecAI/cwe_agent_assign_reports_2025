  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-54393', description='Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Sheikh Heera WP Fiddle allows Stored **XSS**.This issue affects WP Fiddle from n/a through 1.0.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'weakness': ['XSS', 'cross-site scripting'], 'impact': '', 'vector': '', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'Sheikh Heera WP Fiddle', 'version': 'n/a through 1.0', 'component': ''}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**Root Cause:** The WP Fiddle WordPress plugin (versions <= 1.0) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks. This allows an attacker to potentially trick a logged-in user into performing actions they did not intend.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**  A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users (such as administrators) to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site, under their current authentication. The specific impact will vary depending on the actions the vulnerable plugin allows.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a Cross-Site Request Forgery, where a malicious actor crafts a request that is sent to the victim's browser, which, if the user is logged into the vulnerable website, will execute the request as if it was a legitimate one.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into accessing a malicious webpage or link that executes the CSRF attack. The attacker does not need to be authenticated, but the victim needs to be authenticated to the targeted website.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n*   The vulnerability is considered low priority with a CVSS score of 7.1, and it is stated to be unlikely to be exploited.\\n*   There is no official fix available for the vulnerability in the plugin.\\n*   The vulnerability falls under OWASP Top 10 A1: Broken Access Control\\n*   The vulnerability was reported by SOPROBRO.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:Sheikh Heera WP Fiddle', 'keyphrase': 'Sheikh Heera WP Fiddle', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 1.0', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 1.0', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(299.69944121402557)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '434', 'name': 'Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:Sheikh Heera WP Fiddle', 'keyphrase': 'Sheikh Heera WP Fiddle', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 1.0', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 1.0', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(228.72458051794996)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '80', 'name': 'Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(192.6484504057272)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '79', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:Sheikh Heera WP Fiddle', 'keyphrase': 'Sheikh Heera WP Fiddle', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 1.0', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 1.0', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(192.36432350476395)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
