Similarly, **Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output (CWE-116)** can also lead to **SQL Injection (CWE-89)** if special characters are not properly encoded or escaped before being used in an SQL query.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n\n    cwe89 <--|CAUSED_BY| cwe20\n    cwe89 <--|CAUSED_BY| cwe116\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe20,cwe116 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper handling of user input**, specifically, **insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This leads to the **SQL Injection (CWE-89)** vulnerability, which allows an attacker to **append additional SQL queries** to extract sensitive information from the database.\n\nThe chain:\n1.  **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)** / **Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output (CWE-116)**\n2.  **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') (CWE-89)**\n3.  Impact: **SQL Injection** leading to sensitive information disclosure\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and key phrases provided. The description explicitly states that the vulnerability is an **SQL Injection** due to **insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient preparation** of the SQL query. This makes **CWE-89** the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nThe retriever results also support this, as **CWE-89** is consistently ranked as one of the top CWEs for the given key phrases.\n\nThe relationship analysis shows that **CWE-20** and **CWE-116** can be contributing factors to **CWE-89**, as **improper input validation** and **improper escaping** can both lead to **SQL Injection**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as **CWE-89** is a base-level CWE that accurately represents the **SQL Injection** vulnerability, while **CWE-20** and **CWE-116** are class-level CWEs that represent the contributing factors of **improper input validation** and **improper output escaping**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*Not used:* CWE-74 is too general. While SQL Injection is a type of injection, CWE-89 is more specific and thus more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not used:* This CWE does not apply.

It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not used:* Similar to CWE-74.

As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Used as Secondary:* This is a contributing factor as the input is not properly escaped.\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not used:* The description does not discuss any kind of blacklisting.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not used:* Sensitive information exposure is a consequence, but the root cause is SQL injection.\n\n## CWE-34",
