    "rootcause": "The function ieee80211_sta_ps_deliver_wakeup() uses spin_lock() to synchronize with ieee80211_tx_h_unicast_ps_buf(), but does not prevent softirq from executing on the same CPU, leading to a deadlock.",
    "weakness": "The usage of spin_lock() in ieee80211_sta_ps_deliver_wakeup() does not prevent softirqs from interrupting the critical section on the same CPU, which leads to a deadlock when the softirq context attempts to acquire the same lock."
