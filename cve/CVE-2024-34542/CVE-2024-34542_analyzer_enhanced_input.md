## Vulnerability Description
Advantech ADAM-5630 **shares user credentials plain text between the device and the user source device** during the login process.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **shares user credentials plain text between the device and the user source device**
- **product:** Advantech ADAM-5630
- **component:** login process

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The content is related to CVE-2024-34542.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of weak encoding for passwords. During the login process, user credentials are sent in plain text between the device and the user's source device.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Weak encoding for password transmission, specifically using plain text.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can potentially intercept and steal user credentials, which could lead to unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent. An attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the device to intercept the credentials.
- The user needs to be tricked into initiating a login while the attacker is listening on the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned on the same network segment as the device.
- The attacker needs to monitor network traffic to capture the plain text credentials.
- User interaction is required (UI:P - user interaction is needed)
