  "description": "Tabby (formerly Terminus) is a highly configurable terminal emulator. Prior to 1.0.216, Tabby terminal emulator contains **overly permissive entitlements** that are unnecessary for its core functionality and plugin system, creating potential security vulnerabilities. The application currently holds powerful permissions including camera, microphone access, and the ability to access personal folders (Downloads, Documents, etc.) through Apple Events, while also maintaining dangerous entitlements that enable code injection. The concerning entitlements are com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables and com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation. Since Tabbys plugins and themes are NodeJS-based without native libraries or frameworks, and no environment variables are used in the codebase, it is recommended to review and remove at least one of the entitlements (com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation or com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables) to prevent DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES injection while maintaining full application functionality. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.216.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content relates to CVE-2024-55950.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe Tabby terminal emulator has overly permissive entitlements that are unnecessary for its functionality. Specifically, the `com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables` and `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlements are present, while not required for the application to function. This allows for code injection via `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARY` or dylib hijacking.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Unnecessary entitlements: `com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables` and `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation`\n- TCC permissions: The application has access to camera, microphone and personal folders (Downloads, Documents, etc.) via Apple Events.\n- Code injection vulnerability due to the combination of unnecessary entitlements and the hardened runtime not providing the necessary protection against code injection.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **TCC Bypass**: Attackers can inject malicious code that inherits Tabby's TCC permissions, allowing access to the camera, microphone, and personal folders without user consent.\n- **Privacy Implications**: Unauthorized access to sensitive hardware and personal directories could lead to surveillance.\n- **Security Compromise**: Execution of malicious code within Tabby's context and bypass of macOS security controls despite the hardened runtime.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARY` injection.\n- Dylib hijacking.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs initial device access through methods like service exploitation or phishing.\n- The attacker needs standard user privileges and is in a post-exploitation scenario.\n- The attacker uses Tabby's overly permissive entitlements to bypass TCC restrictions and access protected resources.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- The vulnerability is triggered by loading a custom dylib via `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` environment variable through a launch agent, and it bypasses TCC.\n- The provided code examples and steps clearly explain how an attacker could exploit the vulnerability.\n- The report includes references to similar vulnerabilities in other applications (CVE-2020-24259 and CVE-2023-26818).\n- The vulnerable versions of Tabby are below 1.0.216, and the patched version is 1.0.216.",

CWE-267 is a base level CWE, representing the specific issue of unsafe actions being associated with a privilege. CWE-250 is also at the base level and represents execution with unnecessary privileges, which is a related but distinct weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe267[\"CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\"]\n    cwe250[\"CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    \n    cwe267 -->|CHILDOF| cwe269\n    cwe250 -->|CHILDOF| cwe269\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe267 primary\n    class cwe250 secondary\n    class cwe269 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **overly permissive entitlements**, which leads to the ability to perform unsafe actions and ultimately enables code injection, TCC bypass, and unauthorized access to sensitive resources.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified that the vulnerability is rooted in **overly permissive entitlements**. The analysis of the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary revealed that the Tabby terminal emulator possesses powerful permissions that are unnecessary for its core functionality and plugin system, creating potential security vulnerabilities. Specifically, the presence of entitlements such as `com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables` and `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation`, combined with access to camera, microphone, and personal folders, allows for code injection and TCC bypass.\n\nThe provided evidence supports the selection of CWE-267 (Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions) because the **overly permissive entitlements** grant the application privileges that enable unsafe actions like code injection. The evidence also supports the selection of CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges), because Tabby is executing with higher privileges than necessary, and these privileges are the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nThe retriever results included candidates like CWE-426 (Untrusted Search Path), CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)), and CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key). These were rejected because they do not directly relate to the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the presence of **overly permissive entitlements**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-267 and CWE-250 is at the optimal level of specificity because they represent the specific weaknesses that led to the vulnerability.
