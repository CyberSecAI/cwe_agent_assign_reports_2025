# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-55950

## Vulnerability Description
Tabby (formerly Terminus) is a highly configurable terminal emulator. Prior to 1.0.216, Tabby terminal emulator contains **overly permissive entitlements** that are unnecessary for its core functionality and plugin system, creating potential security vulnerabilities. The application currently holds powerful permissions including camera, microphone access, and the ability to access personal folders (Downloads, Documents, etc.) through Apple Events, while also maintaining dangerous entitlements that enable code injection. The concerning entitlements are com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables and com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation. Since Tabbys plugins and themes are NodeJS-based without native libraries or frameworks, and no environment variables are used in the codebase, it is recommended to review and remove at least one of the entitlements (com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation or com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables) to prevent DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES injection while maintaining full application functionality. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.216.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **overly permissive entitlements**
- **impact:** code injection
- **product:** Tabby
- **version:** prior to 1.0.216

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to CVE-2024-55950.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Tabby terminal emulator has overly permissive entitlements that are unnecessary for its functionality. Specifically, the `com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables` and `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlements are present, while not required for the application to function. This allows for code injection via `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARY` or dylib hijacking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unnecessary entitlements: `com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables` and `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation`
- TCC permissions: The application has access to camera, microphone and personal folders (Downloads, Documents, etc.) via Apple Events.
- Code injection vulnerability due to the combination of unnecessary entitlements and the hardened runtime not providing the necessary protection against code injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **TCC Bypass**: Attackers can inject malicious code that inherits Tabby's TCC permissions, allowing access to the camera, microphone, and personal folders without user consent.
- **Privacy Implications**: Unauthorized access to sensitive hardware and personal directories could lead to surveillance.
- **Security Compromise**: Execution of malicious code within Tabby's context and bypass of macOS security controls despite the hardened runtime.

**Attack vectors:**
- `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARY` injection.
- Dylib hijacking.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs initial device access through methods like service exploitation or phishing.
- The attacker needs standard user privileges and is in a post-exploitation scenario.
- The attacker uses Tabby's overly permissive entitlements to bypass TCC restrictions and access protected resources.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by loading a custom dylib via `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` environment variable through a launch agent, and it bypasses TCC.
- The provided code examples and steps clearly explain how an attacker could exploit the vulnerability.
- The report includes references to similar vulnerabilities in other applications (CVE-2020-24259 and CVE-2023-26818).
- The vulnerable versions of Tabby are below 1.0.216, and the patched version is 1.0.216.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
