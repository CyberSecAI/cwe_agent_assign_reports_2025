CWE-425, Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'), is a related CWE where authorization is not adequately enforced. CWE-639 is more specific because it highlights the **user-controlled key** aspect, which is mentioned in the vulnerability description. Both are base-level CWEs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing validation on a user-controlled key** (CWE-639), leading to an **insecure direct object reference**. This allows unauthenticated attackers to **view order details**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which highlights the **missing validation on a user-controlled key** allowing unauthorized access to order details.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"The Event Tickets and Registration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 5.18.1 via the tc-order-id parameter due to **missing validation on a user controlled key**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view order details of orders they did not place, which includes ticket prices, user emails and order date.\"\n\nCWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) accurately captures this vulnerability as the `tc-order-id` parameter is a user-controlled key that is not properly validated, leading to unauthorized access. CWE-425 is a broader category, but CWE-639 is more specific to the vulnerability.
