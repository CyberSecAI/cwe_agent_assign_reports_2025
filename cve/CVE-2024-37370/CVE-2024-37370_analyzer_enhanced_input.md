## Vulnerability Description
In MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.21.3, an attacker can modify the plaintext Extra Count field of a confidential GSS krb5 wrap token, causing the unwrapped token to appear truncated to the application.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** truncated unwrapped token
- **vector:** modify plaintext Extra Count field
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** MIT Kerberos 5
- **version:** before 1.21.3
- **component:** krb5 wrap token

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-37370:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the GSSAPI Kerberos v5 mechanism's message token handling, specifically within the `gss_krb5int_unseal_token_v3()` and `gss_krb5int_unseal_v3_iov()` functions. The vulnerability arises from a failure to properly verify the "Extra Count" field in a confidential GSS krb5 wrap token against the encrypted header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Verification:** The code does not properly validate the Extra Count field of CFX wrap tokens against the encrypted header.
- **Plaintext Modification:** An attacker can modify the plaintext Extra Count field, which leads to the token being perceived as truncated by the application after unwrapping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Truncation:** Successful exploitation can cause the unwrapped token to appear truncated to the application consuming it, leading to potential data loss or incorrect processing of the data.
- **Information Disclosure:** The NetApp advisory notes that the vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be able to modify the plaintext Extra Count field within a confidential GSS krb5 wrap token. This implies the attacker has some ability to intercept or manipulate the message in transit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle:** An attacker must be positioned in the communication path between the client and the server, or be able to inject their own crafted token to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Message Modification:** The attacker requires the ability to modify the plaintext within the Kerberos message.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided Github commit also fixes CVE-2024-37371, which involves invalid memory reads due to invalid length fields in message tokens. This vulnerability is handled in the `kg_unseal_iov_token()` function by separately tracking the header IOV length and complete token length when parsing the token's ASN.1 wrapper.

- The NetApp advisory provides a list of affected products and versions and links to patches.

- The MIT Kerberos security advisories page lists this issue alongside other past vulnerabilities.

- The Github commit includes specific code changes to address the vulnerability, involving stricter checks of the Extra Count and token lengths.
