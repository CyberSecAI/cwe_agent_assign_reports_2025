  "description": "PDF-XChange Editor EMF File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of EMF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24314.",

CWE-125 **Out-of-bounds Read** is a specific type of **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer** (CWE-119). While CWE-119 could apply, CWE-125 is more descriptive of the specific **weakness**. Additionally, CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation** can precede CWE-125 as the **lack of proper validation** can lead to an out-of-bounds read. The abstraction levels were also considered with preference given to the Base level CWE-125.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe125\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Input Validation** (CWE-20) leading to an **Out-of-bounds Read** (CWE-125), resulting in **Information Disclosure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary **weakness** is the **Out-Of-Bounds Read**, as explicitly stated in the vulnerability description: \"PDF-XChange Editor EMF File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**\". The description also mentions \"**lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer.\" This indicates that the root cause is **Improper Input Validation**, which allows the **Out-Of-Bounds Read** to occur, leading to **Information Disclosure**. CWE-125 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly describes the type of **weakness**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available. It also overlaps existing CWE entries and might be deprecated in the future.\n\n## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
