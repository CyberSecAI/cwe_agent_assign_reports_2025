## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-4863 Content

Based on the provided content, this relates to CVE-2025-4863. The content details a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a SQL Injection vulnerability in Advaya GEMS ERP Portal. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `userId` parameter in the `/studentLogin/studentLogin.action` endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection (Boolean-Based Blind)
*   SQL Injection (Time-Based Blind)

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Data Exposure: Sensitive data can be read from the database.
*   Data Manipulation: Records can be inserted, updated, or deleted.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The `userId` parameter in the `/studentLogin/studentLogin.action` endpoint is the attack vector.
*   Boolean-based blind SQL injection payloads (e.g., `userId=testCSC2024' AND 4601=4601-- KCOJ&password=testCSC2024`)
*   Time-based blind SQL injection payloads (using `SLEEP()` function).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   Knowledge of SQL injection techniques is required.
*   Network access to the Advaya GEMS ERP Portal.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content mentions a vulnerability report (ADVAYA-GEMS-Vulnerability-Report.pdf) includes remediation steps, but doesn't detail them here.  General mitigation would involve:

*   Input validation and sanitization of the `userId` parameter.
*   Using parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The PoC includes a Python script (`GEMS_POC.py`) to automate time-based SQL injection for database enumeration.
*   The script features multi-threading, character confirmation, and an interactive menu.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Kuppam Johari and reported to the vendor on October 1, 2024.
*   The content references other vulnerabilities found in the same application (CVE-2015-9251, CVE-2020-11022, CVE-2020-7656, CVE-2020-11023, CVE-2019-11358, CVE-2012-6708).
