# Vulnerability Description

    **Memory corruption** while parsing sensor packets in camera driver, user-space variable is used while allocating memory in kernel and parsing which can lead to huge allocation or invalid memory access.

    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis
    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. 
    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.

    ## WEAKNESS: 'heap-buffer-overflow'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 252.58)

A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc()....

### 2. CWE-126: Buffer Over-read (Score: 251.02)

The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer....

### 3. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 241.48)

The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties....

### 4. CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write (Score: 240.14)

The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....

### 5. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 225.04)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...

## WEAKNESS: 'Memory corruption'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write (Score: 240.14)

The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....

### 2. CWE-667: Improper Locking (Score: 236.95)

The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors....

### 3. CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset (Score: 225.20)

The product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer....

### 4. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 225.04)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...

### 5. CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference (Score: 220.48)

The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL....

## COMPONENT: 'camera driver'

Relevant CWEs for this COMPONENT:

### 1. CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write (Score: 240.14)

The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....

### 2. CWE-667: Improper Locking (Score: 236.95)

The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors....

### 3. CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset (Score: 225.20)

The product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer....

### 4. CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference (Score: 220.48)

The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL....

### 5. CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (Score: 71.12)

The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data....

## ROOTCAUSE: 'use-after-free'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-667: Improper Locking (Score: 236.95)

The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors....

### 2. CWE-415: Double Free (Score: 230.49)

The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations....

### 3. CWE-665: Improper Initialization (Score: 225.47)

The product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used....

### 4. CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset (Score: 225.20)

The product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer....

### 5. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 225.05)

The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently....
