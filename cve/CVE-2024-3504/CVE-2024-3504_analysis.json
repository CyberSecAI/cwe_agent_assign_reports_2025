  "description": "An **improper access control** vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary versions up to and including 1.2.2, where an admin can update any organization user to the organization owner. This vulnerability allows the elevated user to delete projects within the organization. The issue is resolved in version 1.2.7.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content relates to a commit in the `lunary` repository on GitHub. The commit message \"fix: set user to owner\" and the code diff strongly suggest a vulnerability fix related to user role manipulation. Let's break down the changes:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from a flaw in the user role update mechanism. Prior to the fix, it appears that any user with the `admin` role could potentially change another user's role to `owner`, which could lead to unauthorized privilege escalation and control over the application.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Lack of proper authorization checks:** Before the fix, the application was not properly restricting who could modify user roles, specifically the `owner` role.\n*   **Potential for privilege escalation:** An attacker could exploit the lack of authorization by promoting themselves or another malicious user to the `owner` role, gaining full control over the application and its resources.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Complete control over the application:** By elevating a user to the `owner` role, an attacker would likely gain complete control over the application, data, and other user accounts.\n*   **Data breaches and manipulation:** The attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data, modify data, or even delete data.\n*   **Service disruption:** The attacker could also disrupt the service and prevent legitimate users from accessing the application.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Authenticated user with admin role:** An authenticated user with the `admin` role is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n*   **API endpoint manipulation:** The attack would likely involve sending a crafted request to the user update API endpoint.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker would need to have an account with the `admin` role within the application.\n*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the API endpoint responsible for updating user roles.\n\n**Code Diff Details:**\n\nThe provided diff shows the following changes in `packages/backend/src/api/v1/users.ts`:\n\n*   A check is added to prevent users from setting the role to `owner` directly via the API:\n    ```typescript\n     if (role === \"owner\") {\n        ctx.throw(403, \"You cannot modify the owner role\")\n     }\n    ```\n*   A check is added to ensure only a user with `owner` or `admin` roles can perform the action:\n   ```typescript\n   if (![\"owner\", \"admin\"].includes(currentUser.role)) {\n    // ... existing logic that throws an error\n   }\n  ```\n\nThese changes ensure that only `owner` or `admin` roles can modify user roles and that users are no longer able to directly modify the `owner` role.\n\n**In Summary**\n\nThe provided commit addresses a critical vulnerability related to user role manipulation. An authenticated attacker with admin privileges could have used the API to modify user roles and potentially elevate themselves to the owner role, gaining full control of the system. The fix implements additional checks to restrict the ability to set the owner role to prevent unauthorized privilege escalation.",
