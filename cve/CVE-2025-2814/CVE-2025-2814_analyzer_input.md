# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-2814

## Vulnerability Description
CryptCBC versions between 1.21 and 3.05 for Perl may use the rand() function as the default source of entropy, which is not cryptographically secure, for cryptographic functions. This issue affects operating systems where /dev/urandom is unavailable. In that case, CryptCBC will fallback to use the insecure rand() function.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **may use rand() function as the default source of entropy**
- **product:** CryptCBC
- **version:** 1.21 to 3.05
- **component:** Perl

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```text
Relevant content from github.com_bd8a3cbe_20250624_141423.html:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is fixed by using `Crypt::URandom` to read random bytes instead of Perl's `rand()` function, which is not secure.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Using the Perl `rand()` function for generating random bytes.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** Using `Crypt::URandom` to read random bytes.

More detail than the official CVE description is provided.
