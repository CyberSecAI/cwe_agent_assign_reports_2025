  "description": "The CMP CLI client in KeyFactor EJBCA before 8.3.1 has **only 6 octets of salt**, and is thus not compliant with the security requirements of RFC 4211, and might make man-in-the-middle attacks easier. CMP includes password-based MAC as one of the options for message integrity and authentication (the other option is certificate-based). RFC 4211 section 4.4 requires that password-based MAC parameters use a salt with a random value of at least 8 octets. This helps to inhibit dictionary attacks. Because the standalone CMP client originally was developed as test code, the salt was instead hardcoded and only 6 octets long.",

CWE-760 is more specific because it identifies the **use of a predictable salt**, while CWE-916 is more general, indicating insufficient computational effort. CWE-325 could be related, as the weakness involves a **missing step** in proper cryptographic implementation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe760[\"CWE-760: Use of a One-Way Hash with a Predictable Salt\"]\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    cwe325[\"CWE-325: Missing Cryptographic Step\"]\n    \n    cwe760 -->|CHILDOF| cwe916\n    cwe325 --o cwe760\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe760 primary\n    class cwe916,cwe325 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with the **root cause**, which is the **use of a short and hardcoded salt (6 octets)**. This leads to the potential for man-in-the-middle attacks and compromises message integrity and authentication. A **missing step** to improve the randomness and length of the salt contributed to the **predictable salt** issue.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description, which highlights the **use of a short, hardcoded salt**, violating RFC 4211. This **rootcause** directly relates to CWE-760, Use of a One-Way Hash with a Predictable Salt, as the **salt's predictability** is the core issue. The retriever results support this choice, listing CWE-760 as a top candidate.\n\nThe hierarchical relationships influence the selection of CWE-760 as the primary CWE because it provides a more specific classification compared to its parent, CWE-916.
