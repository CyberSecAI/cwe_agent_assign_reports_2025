## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net/mlx5e Take state lock during tx timeout reporter mlx5e_safe_reopen_channels() requires the state lock taken. The referenced changed in the Fixes tag removed the lock to fix another issue. This patch adds it back but at a later point (when calling mlx5e_safe_reopen_channels()) to avoid the deadlock referenced in the Fixes tag.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** net/mlx5e

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, this is a patch for a vulnerability in the Mellanox mlx5 Ethernet driver. All the provided content relates to the same vulnerability and patch.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a missing state lock when calling `mlx5e_safe_reopen_channels()` within the transmit timeout reporter function (`mlx5e_tx_reporter_timeout_recover`). A previous fix had removed the lock to resolve a different issue. However, the `mlx5e_safe_reopen_channels()` function requires the state lock to operate correctly.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing state lock when calling `mlx5e_safe_reopen_channels()` during transmit timeout recovery.
- Potential for race conditions when accessing or modifying the mlx5e driver's state information without proper locking

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The original commit that removed the lock intended to fix a possible deadlock scenario. This patch reintroduces the lock but at a later point to avoid the original deadlock. If the lock is not acquired, race conditions or other undefined behavior may occur. The exact impact is not specified in detail but could lead to unpredictable operation, possible crashes, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via the transmit timeout reporter in the mlx5e driver. Any action that could result in a transmit timeout may trigger the vulnerable code path. This could be achieved by network congestion, hardware malfunctions, or other error conditions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to trigger a transmit timeout on a system using the affected Mellanox mlx5e Ethernet driver. This could be a local attacker with network configuration or device access or a remote attacker able to create network conditions that result in the specific device timeout.
