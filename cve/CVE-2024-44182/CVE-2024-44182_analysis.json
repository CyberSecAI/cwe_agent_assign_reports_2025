No other parent or child relationships are applicable based on the description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe212 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper redaction of sensitive information** (CWE-212), which leads to an app being able to access sensitive data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the issue was addressed with improved redaction of sensitive information. This directly aligns with CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer). The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms this. Therefore, CWE-212 is the most appropriate CWE.\n\nThe retriever results suggested several CWEs, but most of them are not directly related to the root cause of the vulnerability. For example, CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), CWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')), CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) and CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) are not relevant. CWE-277 (Insecure Inherited Permissions) is also not relevant as the issue is related to redaction of information, not insecure permissions.\n\nCWE-212 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
