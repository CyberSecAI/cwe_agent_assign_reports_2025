CVE-2024-40461\nFinding Name: Unauthorized access to function \u201cStock Order Entry\u201d\nCWE: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/285.html\nhttps://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/274.html\nhttps://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/280.html\nProduct: Ocuco Innovation https://www.ocuco.com/industry-solutions/labs/innovations\nSoftware: Ocuco Innovation - STOCKORDERENTRY.EXE 2.10.24.9\nDescription:\nThe issue involves a vulnerability in the Windows software Ocuco Innovation, specifically in the STOCKORDERENTRY.EXE version 2.10.24.9. This vulnerability allows users to gain unauthorized administrative access to the software without proper authentication. By intercepting and modifying TCP packets, an attacker can manipulate the software's login process and access the Application Manager function without authorization checks. This bypasses the intended security measures and grants full access to all software functions.\nImplications\n1. Security Risks: The vulnerability exposes Ocuco Innovation to significant security risks, potentially leading to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive data stored within the software.\n2. Regulatory Compliance: Failure to address this vulnerability could result in non-compliance with industry regulations and standards regarding data protection and software security.\n3. Reputation Damage: Exploitation of the vulnerability could damage Ocuco Innovation's reputation among its customers and stakeholders, leading to loss of trust and potential business impact.\n4. Operational Disruption: In the event of a successful attack exploiting this vulnerability, there could be operational disruptions, downtime, and financial losses associated with remediation efforts and recovery.\n5. Legal Consequences: Depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the data affected, there could be legal consequences, including fines and legal actions, if sensitive information is compromised due to the vulnerability.\nRecommendations\n1. Patch the Vulnerability: This is a zero-day vulnerability. It is recommended to restrict network access to this software to authorized users only until a fixed and patched version of the software is released.\n2. Network Segmentation: Implement network segmentation to restrict access to critical systems and services. This can help contain potential attacks and limit the scope of unauthorized access attempts.\n3. Monitor Network Traffic: Regularly monitor network traffic for any suspicious activities, especially around the affected software and systems. Look for anomalies that could indicate exploitation attempts.\n4. User Education: Educate users and administrators about the importance of cybersecurity hygiene, including recognizing phishing attempts and other social engineering tactics that could exploit this vulnerability.\n5. Access Controls: Review and strengthen access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel have administrative access to critical systems and software components.\nProof-of-concept (PoC):\nStep 1: The software \"Stock Order Entry\" or STOCKORDERENTRY.EXE is required to log in with privileges.\nStep 2: Intercept TCP packets. This is the original packet.\nStep 3: Intercept and then modify the TCP packet by manipulating bytes in the packet to whitespace \"20\" in hex characters.\nStep 4: An error occurs when a program tries to access a memory location\n\u2022 Access violation: This type of error occurs when a program tries to access a memory location that it is not allowed to access.\n\u2022 71533740 in module 'VCRUNTIME140.dll': This specifies the location in the module (DLL) where the violation occurred. VCRUNTIME140.dll is a part of the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable package.\n\u2022 Read of address 27C7B578: This indicates the specific memory address that the program tried to access, which caused the violation.\nStep 5: The attacker successfully bypassed access controls to reach the \"Stock Order Entry\u201d software without authorization, enabling them to perform any activities within the software.\n```\n- Root cause of vulnerability: Manipulating TCP packets to bypass authentication.\n- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Unauthorized access, lack of proper authentication, TCP packet manipulation.\n- Impact of exploitation: Unauthorized access to the \"Stock Order Entry\" function, potential manipulation of sensitive data, operational disruption, regulatory non-compliance, reputation damage, legal consequences.\n- Attack vectors: Intercepting and modifying TCP packets.\n- Required attacker capabilities/position: Ability to intercept and modify TCP packets.\n- Mitigation or fix: Restrict network access, implement network segmentation, monitor network traffic, user education, strengthen access controls, patch the vulnerability.",

The secondary CWE is CWE-306, which is a Base-level CWE and focuses on missing authentication for critical functions.

The key aspect of the vulnerability is the unauthorized access achieved by manipulating TCP packets, which allows bypassing intended security measures.\n\nThe primary classification is CWE-863 \"Incorrect Authorization\" because the attacker is able to gain unauthorized administrative access by manipulating TCP packets, effectively bypassing authorization checks. The CVE description states, \"By intercepting and modifying TCP packets, an attacker can manipulate the software's login process and access the Application Manager function without authorization checks.\" This directly indicates a flaw in the authorization process.\n\nA secondary classification is CWE-306 \"Missing Authentication for Critical Function\" because the vulnerability allows users to gain unauthorized administrative access to the software without proper authentication. The root cause is the **manipulation of TCP packets to bypass authentication**.\n\nThe final selection is based on the evidence from the CVE description and the relationships between the CWEs. CWE-863 is chosen because it directly addresses the **incorrect authorization** issue. CWE-306 is included to highlight the **missing authentication** aspect of the vulnerability.
