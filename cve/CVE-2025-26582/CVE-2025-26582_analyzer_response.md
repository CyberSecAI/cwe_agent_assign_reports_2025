# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-26582

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | 0.9 | Compound | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 0.8 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CSRF (CWE-352), which can then lead to stored XSS (CWE-79) if a successful CSRF attack allows an attacker to inject malicious script into the application's data. While CWE-79 is listed as a top result, the root cause is the **missing** or **insufficient** CSRF protection. CWE-79 is related to improper neutralization of input, which is a consequence of the successful CSRF.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **missing** or **insufficient** CSRF protection (CWE-352). An attacker leverages this to perform actions on behalf of a user. In this specific case, the attacker injects malicious scripts, leading to stored XSS (CWE-79). The root cause is the **lack** of CSRF protection which then allows for XSS injection.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment considered both CWE-352 and CWE-79. The final decision prioritizes CWE-352 as the primary cause because the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary both explicitly mention **Cross-Site Request Forgery** as the main issue. The stored XSS is a consequence of a successful CSRF attack that allows an attacker to inject the XSS payload.

The evidence for CWE-352 is:
*   "**Cross-Site Request Forgery** (CSRF) vulnerability in Blackbam TinyMCE Advanced qTranslate fix editor problems allows Stored **XSS**." (Vulnerability Description)
*   "**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)." (CVE Reference Links Content Summary)

The evidence for CWE-79 is:
*   "...allows Stored **XSS**." (Vulnerability Description)

The relationship analysis shows that CWE-79 can follow CWE-352, meaning a CSRF vulnerability can lead to XSS. The abstraction level of CWE-352 is Compound, which is acceptable because it represents a combination of weaknesses that need to occur simultaneously. However, since the description explicitly describes a CSRF vulnerability, it is the most fitting primary CWE. CWE-79 is a base level and is a good fit for the XSS impact.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine
