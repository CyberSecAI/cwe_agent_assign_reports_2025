# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-4373

## Vulnerability Description
A flaw was found in GLib, which is vulnerable to an **integer overflow** in the g_string_insert_unichar() function. When the position at which to insert the character is large, the position will overflow, leading to a buffer underwrite.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **integer overflow**
- **impact:** buffer underwrite
- **product:** GLib
- **component:** g_string_insert_unichar() function
