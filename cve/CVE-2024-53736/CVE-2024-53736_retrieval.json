This means that a malicious actor can potentially force a logged-in user with higher privileges to perform unwanted actions on the website.\\n\\n**Weaknesses:**\\n*   Absence of CSRF protection mechanisms within the plugin.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n*   A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions, though the exact impact varies case by case.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n*   An attacker crafts a malicious request and tricks a logged-in, privileged user into initiating the request. This could be through a malicious link, email or a website under the attacker\\'s control.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and have a logged-in, higher privileged user interact with it.\\n*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as the user they are targeting is already authenticated.\\n*   The attacker does not need any specific privileges on the target website.\\n\\n**Additional details:**\\n\\n*   The vulnerable plugin is `Custom Shortcode Sidebars` version <= 1.2.\\n*   The vulnerability is classified under OWASP Top 10 as \"A1: Broken Access Control\".\\n*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.1.\\n*   The vulnerability has a \"Low\" priority because it is unlikely to be exploited.\\n* There is no official fix available for the vulnerability.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:Jason Grim Custom Shortcode Sidebars', 'keyphrase': 'Jason Grim Custom Shortcode Sidebars', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 1.2', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 1.2', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(281.0845063832672)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '434', 'name': 'Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 1.2', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 1.2', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(207.77289323186142)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
