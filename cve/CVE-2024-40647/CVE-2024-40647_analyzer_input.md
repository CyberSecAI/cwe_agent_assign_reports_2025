# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-40647

## Vulnerability Description
sentry-sdk is the official Python SDK for Sentry.io. A bug in Sentrys Python SDK < 2.8.0 allows the environment variables to be passed to subprocesses despite the `env={}` setting. In Pythons `subprocess` calls, all environment variables are passed to subprocesses by default. However, if you specifically do not want them to be passed to subprocesses, you may use `env` argument in `subprocess` calls. Due to the bug in Sentry SDK, with the Stdlib integration enabled (which is enabled by default), this expectation is not fulfilled, and all environment variables are being passed to subprocesses instead. The issue has been patched in pull request #3251 and is included in sentry-sdk==2.8.0. We strongly recommend upgrading to the latest SDK version. However, if its not possible, and if passing environment variables to child processes poses a security risk for you, you can disable all default integrations.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **bug in Sentry's Python SDK**
- **impact:** pass environment variables to subprocesses
- **product:** sentry-sdk
- **version:** < 2.8.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-40647:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content clearly relates to CVE-2024-40647. It describes a vulnerability in the Sentry Python SDK that unintentionally exposes environment variables to subprocesses and links to the GitHub Security Advisory that includes the CVE ID.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in how the Sentry Python SDK's `StdlibIntegration` handles the `env` argument when calling `subprocess.Popen`. When an empty dictionary `{}` was explicitly passed as the `env` argument to `subprocess.Popen`, the SDK incorrectly interpreted it as a `None` environment. Consequently, instead of passing an empty environment, the SDK passed the entire environment of the parent process to the subprocess.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Unintentional Environment Variable Exposure:** The primary weakness is the unintended leakage of environment variables to child processes. This happens even when the user explicitly sets `env={}` in the `subprocess` call, intending to pass no environment variables.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the potential disclosure of sensitive information stored in environment variables. If an attacker can influence the execution of a subprocess through the vulnerable Sentry SDK, they could gain access to sensitive data present in the environment of the parent process. This could include API keys, passwords, or other confidential information.

**5. Attack vectors:**

- **Subprocess Execution:** The attack vector involves a scenario where the application using the vulnerable Sentry SDK executes subprocesses using the Python `subprocess` module while also using the `StdlibIntegration` of the Sentry SDK. If the application is passing a specific `env` argument, the vulnerability would not be triggered.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Code Execution:** The attacker would need to have some control over the code being executed by the Python application to be able to trigger the spawning of a subprocess using the `subprocess` module with an empty `env` argument while the Sentry SDK's `StdlibIntegration` is enabled.
- **Environment Access:** The attacker benefits most when the parent process' environment contains sensitive information that can be accessed by the spawned child process.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Versions:** Sentry Python SDK versions prior to 2.8.0 are affected.
- **Patched Versions:** The issue has been patched in versions 2.8.0 and 1.45.1.
- **Workarounds:**
    - Replace `env={}` with `env={"EMPTY_ENV": "1"}` or similar in application code.
    - Disable the `StdlibIntegration` in the Sentry SDK initialization.
