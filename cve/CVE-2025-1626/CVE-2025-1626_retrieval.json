It details a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Qi Blocks plugin for WordPress. Here\\'s a breakdown of the extracted information:\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\n\\nThe plugin does not validate and escape some of its Countdown block options before outputting them back in a page/post.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n\\n*   Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\\n*   Insufficient input validation and output encoding.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n\\nAn attacker with Contributor+ role can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browser of users viewing the affected post.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n\\n*   An attacker with Contributor+ access creates a post.\\n*   Adds a Countdown block to the post.\\n*   Injects a malicious payload (e.g., `<img src=x onerror=alert(/XSS/)>`) into the \"Second Singular Label\" field of the Countdown block.\\n*   Saves the post.\\n*   The XSS is triggered when the second value of the counter reaches 00 when (pre)viewing the post.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n\\n*   Authenticated user with Contributor+ role or higher.\\n\\n**Mitigation or fix:**\\n\\n*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.4 of the Qi Blocks plugin.\\n\\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\\n\\n*   **Proof of Concept:** Detailed steps on how to reproduce the vulnerability are provided.\\n*   **CVSS Score:** 5.9 (Medium)\\n*   **References:** Links to the CVE entry ([https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2025-1626](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2025-1626)) and a research report ([https://research.cleantalk.org/CVE-2025-1626/](https://research.cleantalk.org/CVE-2025-1626/)).\\n*   **CWE:** CWE-79\\n*   **OWASP Top 10:** A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\\n*   **Timeline:** Publicly published on 2025-04-28.\\n*   **Researcher:** Krugov Artyom\\n*   **WPVDB ID:** f00d86f1-7ff9-4001-af16-989358d811a8', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:improper validation and escaping', 'keyphrase': 'improper validation and escaping', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:Cross-Site Scripting', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks', 'keyphrase': 'Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'impact:Stored XSS', 'keyphrase': 'Stored XSS', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'attacker:users with contributor role and above', 'keyphrase': 'users with contributor role and above', 'type': 'attacker'}, {'id': 'product:Qi Blocks WordPress plugin', 'keyphrase': 'Qi Blocks WordPress plugin', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:before 1.4', 'keyphrase': 'before 1.4', 'type': 'version'}, {'id': 'component:Countdown block', 'keyphrase': 'Countdown block', 'type': 'component'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(435.12515544281194)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
