**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10352

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `get_content_type` function within the `includes/widgets/content-reveal.php` file of the Magical Addons For Elementor plugin. This function is used to retrieve and display content, including Elementor templates. It does not properly check if the template is published before displaying it.

- **Insufficient Access Control:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any authenticated user with contributor level access or higher.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with contributor access or higher can access and view the content of unpublished, draft, or private Elementor templates.
- This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, such as upcoming page layouts, design elements, or pre-release content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site with at least contributor level privileges.
- The attacker exploits the vulnerable `get_content_type` function by triggering the content reveal widget, specifically when set to display template content.
