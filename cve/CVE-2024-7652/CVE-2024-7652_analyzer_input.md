## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7652:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an error in the ECMA-262 specification concerning Async Generators. Specifically, a refactor in May 2021 introduced a flaw in how promises and `IteratorResult` objects were handled within the async generator machinery. This allowed crafted `IteratorResult` objects to become then-ables, leading to unexpected behavior when these objects were used as part of the generator's internal operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Type Confusion:** The core issue is a type confusion where the async generator machinery incorrectly assumes that `IteratorResult` objects cannot be then-ables. This allows malicious manipulation of the object.
*   **Violation of Internal Invariants**: The crafted then-able `IteratorResult` objects re-enter the async generator machinery, bypassing internal checks and breaking its expected behavior.
*   **Memory Corruption**: The type confusion can lead to memory corruption, which is a security vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The type confusion can result in memory corruption.
*   **Exploitable Crash:** The memory corruption can lead to an exploitable crash, which could be further exploited by an attacker.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** The advisory indicates the possibility that the memory corruption may potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, though this is not stated with certainty.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based (`AV:N`). The vulnerability is triggered via the JavaScript engine when processing manipulated or specially crafted code involving async generators.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** An attacker doesn't need elevated privileges (`PR:N`).
*   **No User Interaction:** Exploitation does not require user interaction (`UI:N`).
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely via malicious content loaded through a network.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of ECMA-262 from 2022 up to 2024 and was fixed in the 2025 version.
*   The issue was found in multiple JavaScript engine implementations, including Mozilla's SpiderMonkey (used in Firefox and Thunderbird) and has also been found in the implementation of other JavaScript engines.
*   The severity is rated as "High" with a CVSS score of 8.6.
*   The provided text also included information for other CVEs that were fixed in the same security advisories and will not be included in this analysis.
