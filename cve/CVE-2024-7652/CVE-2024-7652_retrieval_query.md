## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7652:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an error in the ECMA-262 specification concerning Async Generators. Specifically, a refactor in May 2021 introduced a flaw in how promises and `IteratorResult` objects were handled within the async generator machinery. This allowed crafted `IteratorResult` objects to become then-ables, leading to unexpected behavior when these objects were used as part of the generator's internal operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Type Confusion:** The core issue is a type confusion where the async generator machinery incorrectly assumes that `IteratorResult` objects cannot be then-ables. This allows malicious manipulation of the object.
*   **Violation of Internal Invariants**: The crafted then-able `IteratorResult` objects re-enter the async generator machinery, bypassing internal checks and breaking its expected behavior.
*   **Memory Corruption**: The type confusion can lead to memory corruption, which is a security vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The type confusion can result in memory corruption.
*   **Exploitable Crash:** The memory corruption can lead to an exploitable crash, which could be further exploited by an attacker.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** The advisory indicates the possibility that the memory corruption may potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, though this is not stated with certainty.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based (`AV:N`). The vulnerability is triggered via the JavaScript engine when processing manipulated or specially crafted code involving async generators.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** An attacker doesn't need elevated privileges (`PR:N`).
*   **No User Interaction:** Exploitation does not require user interaction (`UI:N`).
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely via malicious content loaded through a network.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of ECMA-262 from 2022 up to 2024 and was fixed in the 2025 version.
*   The issue was found in multiple JavaScript engine implementations, including Mozilla's SpiderMonkey (used in Firefox and Thunderbird) and has also been found in the implementation of other JavaScript engines.
*   The severity is rated as "High" with a CVSS score of 8.6.
*   The provided text also included information for other CVEs that were fixed in the same security advisories and will not be included in this analysis.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.

### Extended Description


When the product accesses the resource using an incompatible type, this could trigger logical errors because the resource does not have expected properties. In languages without memory safety, such as C and C++, type confusion can lead to out-of-bounds memory access.


While this weakness is frequently associated with unions when parsing data with many different embedded object types in C, it can be present in any application that can interpret the same variable or memory location in multiple ways.


This weakness is not unique to C and C++. For example, errors in PHP applications can be triggered by providing array parameters when scalars are expected, or vice versa. Languages such as Perl, which perform automatic conversion of a variable of one type when it is accessed as if it were another type, can also contain these issues.


### Alternative Terms
Object Type Confusion

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-704
ChildOf -> CWE-704
CanPrecede -> CWE-119

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.
**Reasons:**
- Acceptable-Use


### Additional Notes
**[Applicable Platform]** 

This weakness is possible in any type-unsafe programming language.


**[Research Gap]** 

Type confusion weaknesses have received some attention by applied researchers and major software vendors for C and C++ code. Some publicly-reported vulnerabilities probably have type confusion as a root-cause weakness, but these may be described as "memory corruption" instead.


For other languages, there are very few public reports of type confusion weaknesses. These are probably under-studied. Since many programs rely directly or indirectly on loose typing, a potential "type confusion" behavior might be intentional, possibly requiring more manual analysis.




### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2010-4577:** Type confusion in CSS sequence leads to out-of-bounds read.
- **CVE-2011-0611:** Size inconsistency allows code execution, first discovered when it was actively exploited in-the-wild.

### Mapping Guidance
**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review
**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit
**Reasons:**
- Abstraction



### Observed Examples
- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
- **CVE-2022-3979:** Chain: data visualization program written in PHP uses the "!=" operator instead of the type-strict "!==" operator (CWE-480) when validating hash values, potentially leading to an incorrect type conversion (CWE-704)




## CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses or accesses a resource that has not been initialized.

### Extended Description
When a resource has not been properly initialized, the product may behave unexpectedly. This may lead to a crash or invalid memory access, but the consequences vary depending on the type of resource and how it is used within the product.

### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships
ChildOf -> CWE-665

## CWE-416: Use After Free
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Stable

### Description
The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory "belongs" to the code that operates on the new pointer.

### Extended Description
Not provided

### Alternative Terms
Dangling pointer: a pointer that no longer points to valid memory, often after it has been freed

## CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable
**Abstraction:** Variant
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The code uses a variable that has not been initialized, leading to unpredictable or unintended results.

### Extended Description
In some languages such as C and C++, stack variables are not initialized by default. They generally contain junk data with the contents of stack memory before the function was invoked. An attacker can sometimes control or read these contents. In other languages or conditions, a variable that is not explicitly initialized can be given a default value that has security implications, depending on the logic of the program. The presence of an uninitialized variable can sometimes indicate a typographic error in the code.
