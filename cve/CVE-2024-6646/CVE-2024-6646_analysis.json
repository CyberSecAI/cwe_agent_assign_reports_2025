  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Netgear WN604 up to 20240710. It has been rated as problematic. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /downloadFile.php of the component Web Interface. The manipulation of the argument file with the input config leads to information disclosure. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-271052. NOTE The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability lies in the `downloadFile.php` script of the NETGEAR Wireless N150 Access Point WN604. Specifically, the script processes the `file` parameter insecurely, allowing for the retrieval of sensitive files through path manipulation.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive information, specifically the configuration file, likely containing usernames and passwords used for accessing the device's web interface.\n- **Path Traversal/Manipulation:** The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a specific file path as the value of the `file` parameter in the URL to `downloadFile.php`, without proper sanitization of input.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized Access:** By obtaining the configuration file, an attacker can gain access to the device's administrative interface.\n- **Device Compromise:**  With administrative access, an attacker can potentially modify device settings, network configurations, and possibly install malicious firmware.\n- **Network Exposure:**  Compromised devices can be used as an entry point into the network or used for further attacks.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker makes an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `downloadFile.php` script.\n- **URL Parameter Manipulation:**  The attacker manipulates the `file` parameter in the URL, specifically requesting the `config` file, e.g., `/downloadFile.php?file=config`.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device. This could be LAN access if they are on the same network, or potentially WAN access if the device is exposed to the internet.\n- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:**  The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests and URL parameters.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The provided GitHub issue shows the specific URL manipulation to exploit the vulnerability: `/downloadFile.php?file=config`\n- The GitHub issue also demonstrates how to use the obtained credentials to log in to the backend web interface, further confirming the impact of the vulnerability.\n- Example IP addresses are provided, suggesting the vulnerability was found in the wild.",

This leads to **exposure of sensitive system information** (CWE-497), such as configuration files containing usernames and passwords.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-22 because the root cause of the vulnerability is the ability to read arbitrary files due to path traversal. The exposure of the configuration file is a direct consequence of this.\n\nThe selection of CWE-22 is based on the following evidence:\n- \"manipulation of the argument file with the input config leads to information disclosure\"\n- \"Specifically, the script processes the `file` parameter insecurely, allowing for the retrieval of sensitive files through path manipulation.\"\n- \"The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a specific file path as the value of the `file` parameter in the URL to `downloadFile.php`, without proper sanitization of input.\"\n\nCWE-497 is included as a secondary weakness because the impact of the vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
