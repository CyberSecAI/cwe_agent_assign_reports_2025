## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11648 (Although this CVE ID is not mentioned in the content, the content does relate to a vulnerability and is likely related to the CVE)

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is located in the `admin/add-customer.php` file of the "Beauty Parlour Management System PHP SQLite Project". The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `name` parameter, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which arises from directly incorporating user-supplied input into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain access to the database without authorization.
*   **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers could extract sensitive data from the database.
*   **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
*  **System Control:** Attackers could potentially gain comprehensive system control.
*   **Service Interruption:** The attack could result in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `admin/add-customer.php` file.
*   **Malicious `name` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected through the `name` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `name` parameter is vulnerable.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious SQL:** The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious SQL payloads to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without needing to log in or be authorized.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerability is located in the `admin/add-customer.php` file.
*   The vulnerable parameter is the `name` parameter in the POST request.
*   The SQL injection payload uses a time-based blind SQL injection technique.
*   A sample payload is:
     `name=111' AND (SELECT 6475 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))vdqw) AND 'yIfS'='yIfS&email=12@qq.com&mobilenum=1111111111&gender=Female&details=1111111111&submit=`
*  The SQLmap tool was used to verify the vulnerability.

**Suggested Remediation:**
1.  **Use Prepared Statements and Parameter Binding:**
    *   This is the primary way to prevent SQL injection. Use parameterized queries to ensure user input is treated as data, not as SQL code.
2.  **Input Validation and Filtering:**
    *   Validate and filter user inputs strictly according to the expected format to prevent injection of SQL special characters.
3.  **Minimize Database User Permissions:**
    *   Use database accounts with minimal required permissions for the application. Avoid using root or admin-level accounts for regular operations.
4.  **Regular Security Audits:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits of the code and system to identify and fix any vulnerabilities.
