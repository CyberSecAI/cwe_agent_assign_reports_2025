The Retriever results confirm the relevance of **CWE-20**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code\"]\n    \n    cwe94 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)**. Because of the **improper input validation**, this leads to the ability to inject code, resulting in **Improper Control of Generation of Code (CWE-94)** and subsequent RCE.\n  - **CWE-20**: Root cause - **Improper input validation**\n  - **CWE-94**: Impact - Code Injection leading to RCE\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the **root cause** is **Improper Input Validation**. This directly aligns with **CWE-20**. The provided retriever results also list **CWE-20** as a relevant weakness, supporting its selection. While **CWE-20** is a Class, it accurately represents the **root cause** in this scenario. Since RCE is the impact, **CWE-94** is included as a secondary weakness to show how the **improper input validation** resulted in the code injection and remote code execution. This assessment is primarily based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions **improper input validation**. The relationship graph highlights how input validation errors can lead to code injection vulnerabilities.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nDuring installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
