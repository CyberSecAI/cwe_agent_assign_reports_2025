  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-31125 related content\n\nHere's an analysis of the provided content, focusing on information relevant to CVE-2025-31125, following the given guidelines:\n\n**1. Verification:**\n\nThe content directly references CVE-2025-31125 and describes a vulnerability in Vite. The description aligns with a security issue related to bypassing the `server.fs.deny` feature, allowing access to arbitrary files.\n\n**2. Extraction of Relevant Information:**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**\n    The vulnerability stems from insufficient checks when handling requests with `?inline&import` or `?raw?import` query parameters. These parameters, when combined with file requests, bypass the intended file access restrictions enforced by `server.fs.deny`.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    *   Bypass of file access controls (`server.fs.deny`).\n    *   Improper input validation of query parameters.\n    *   Exposure of arbitrary file content.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:**\n    An attacker can retrieve the contents of arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure. The impact is limited to applications explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network (using `--host` or `server.host` config option).\n*   **Attack vectors:**\n    *   Crafting URLs with specific query parameters (`?inline&import` or `?raw?import`) to request files.\n    *   Example URL: `http://localhost:5173/@fs/C:/windows/win.ini?import&?inline=1.wasm?init`\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n    *   Network access to the Vite dev server.\n    *   Ability to craft and send malicious HTTP requests.\n    *   No authentication or special privileges are required.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:**\n    The vulnerability is patched in versions:\n    *   `>=6.2.4`\n    *   `>=6.1.3, <6.2.0`\n    *   `>=6.0.13, <6.1.0`\n    *   `>=5.4.16, <6.0.0`\n    *   `>=4.5.11, <5.0.0`\n    The commit `5967313` includes a fix to the `transformMiddleware` function, adding checks for `urlRE`, `rawRE`, and `inlineRE` to prevent bypassing the file system access controls.\n\n**3. Additional Details:**\n\n*   The content provides more detail than the official CVE description (which is currently a placeholder). It includes specific examples of attack vectors, the root cause, and the mitigation steps.\n*   The CVSS score is provided: 3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, indicating a moderate severity.\n*   The vulnerability was reported by @Iuhsssss.\n*   The commit message indicates the fix is related to a check in the transform middleware (`#19761`).\n\n**Response:**\n\nThe provided content is directly related to CVE-2025-31125 and contains detailed information about the vulnerability, its impact, and mitigation. The extracted information is presented above.",

CWE-22 is a base-level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction. The vulnerability involves using `?inline&import` or `?raw?import` to bypass `server.fs.deny`, allowing access to arbitrary files, thus traversing outside the intended restricted directory. CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) and CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery) are also considered, but CWE-22 is more specific to the **root cause**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    \n    cwe22 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe668\n    cwe22 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe918\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe668,cwe918 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Limitation of a Pathname** (CWE-22) due to insufficient checks on the `?inline&import` or `?raw?import` parameters. This allows an attacker to access files outside the intended restricted directory. This leads to **Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere** (CWE-668) since unauthorized files are being accessed. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CWE-918) can occur if the application retrieves the contents of a URL from an upstream component without sufficient validation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The key evidence is the ability to bypass the file access restrictions enforced by `server.fs.deny` using specific query parameters. This aligns strongly with CWE-22, as it involves traversing outside the intended restricted directory.\n\nThe retriever results suggested CWE-668 and CWE-918, which are relevant to the impact of the vulnerability (information disclosure). However, CWE-22 is more specific to the underlying weakness, which is the **improper limitation of a pathname**.\n\nThe relationship graph influenced the decision by highlighting how CWE-22 can lead to CWE-668 or CWE-918, but CWE-22 is the primary weakness.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-22 directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability (improper path limitation), while CWE-668 and CWE-918 describe potential impacts. The evidence supports this classification because the vulnerability allows an attacker to access files outside the intended restricted directory, which is a clear example of path traversal.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
