CWE-125 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), which is a broader class of memory safety issues. The retriever results also suggest CWE-125 as a relevant candidate. The selection of CWE-125 is preferred because it is a Base level CWE and more specific than its parent class, CWE-119.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively simple:\n1.  Root Cause: **Out-of-bounds read** due to a coding error or lack of proper input validation.\n2.  Impact: Local privileged attackers can read out-of-bounds memory, potentially leading to information disclosure or other exploitable conditions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on a clear vulnerability description indicating an **out-of-bounds read**. The selection of CWE-125 is strongly supported by the evidence and the retriever results. While CWE-119 is a parent class, CWE-125 provides a more precise characterization of the vulnerability.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states \"**Out-of-bounds read** in enrollment with cdsp frame secfr trustlet prior to SMR Apr-2025 Release 1 allows local privileged attackers to read out-of-bounds memory.\" This clearly indicates that the software reads data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer, which aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-125.\n\nThe selection of CWE-125 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly describes the nature of the weakness, without being overly broad or abstract.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary.
