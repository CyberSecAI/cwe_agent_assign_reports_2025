# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-50030

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/xe/ct prevent **UAF** in send_recv() Ensure we serialize with completion side to prevent **UAF** with fence going out of scope on the stack, since we have no clue if it will fire after the timeout before we can erase from the xa. Also we have some dependent loads and stores for which we need the correct ordering, and we lack the needed barriers. Fix this by grabbing the ct->lock after the wait, which is also held by the completion side. v2 (Badal) - Also print done after acquiring the lock and seeing timeout. (cherry picked from commit 52789ce35c55ccd30c4b67b9cc5b2af55e0122ea)

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a race condition in the `send_recv()` function within the Intel Xe graphics driver (`drivers/gpu/drm/xe/xe_guc_ct.c`). Specifically, a fence object, allocated on the stack, could potentially go out of scope before the completion side of the operation has finished. The function was not properly synchronized with the completion side. This could lead to a use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability. Additionally, there were missing memory barriers that could lead to incorrect ordering of memory operations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Use-after-free (UAF):** The primary vulnerability is a UAF. If the fence object's completion happens after the `send_recv()` function has returned and the object is no longer valid, then the completion side could be accessing freed memory.
*   **Race condition:** The lack of proper synchronization between the main code flow and completion side creates a race condition.
*  **Missing memory barriers**: There were missing memory barriers that could lead to incorrect ordering of memory operations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:
*   **Memory corruption:** Accessing freed memory can corrupt the memory state.
*   **System crash:** Memory corruption could lead to a system crash.
*   **Potential arbitrary code execution:** While not explicitly stated, in some scenarios, UAF vulnerabilities can be leveraged for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves triggering the `send_recv()` function in a way that causes the fence object to be accessed after it has gone out of scope. This would require interacting with the Intel Xe graphics driver.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to trigger the `send_recv()` function within the Intel Xe graphics driver. This likely requires user-level access with the ability to make calls into the graphics driver via ioctl interface or other APIs.

**Mitigation:**
The fix involves acquiring the `ct->lock` mutex after waiting for the event and before erasing the fence from the xa. This ensures that the fence object is not accessed on the completion side after it has been freed in `send_recv`.
The fix also adds memory barriers to ensure the correct order of memory operations.
