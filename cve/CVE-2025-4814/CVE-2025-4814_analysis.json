  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-4814 Content\n\nThe provided content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it does not directly reference CVE-2025-4814. It details a SQL injection vulnerability in \"campcodes Sales and Inventory System V1.0\" specifically in the `/pages/supplier_add.php` file.  It provides more detail than a typical CVE description.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the 'name' parameter in `/pages/supplier_add.php`. Malicious SQL queries can be injected because the input is used directly in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering\n*   System control\n*   Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is exploitable via the 'name' parameter in a POST request to `/pages/supplier_add.php`.\n*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.\n*   **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.\n*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the least necessary privileges.\n*   **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.\n\n**Payload Example:**\n\n```\nParameter: MULTIPART name ((custom) POST)\n    Type: boolean-based blind\n    Title: MySQL RLIKE boolean-based blind - WHERE, HAVING, ORDER BY or GROUP BY clause\n    Payload: ------WebKitFormBoundaryJgXBK6LwDG5xjJa5\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"name\"\n\n123' RLIKE (SELECT (CASE WHEN (6375=6375) THEN 123 ELSE 0x28 END)) AND 'cBtu'='cBtu\n------WebKitFormBoundaryJgXBK6LwDG5xjJa5\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"address\"\n\n123\n------WebKitFormBoundaryJgXBK6LwDG5xjJa5\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"contact\"\n\n123\n```\n\n**Software Link:**\n\n*   <https://www.campcodes.com/downloads/sales-and-inventory-system-with-credit-management-using-php-source-code/?wpdmdl=5804&ind=0>",

There are no parent-child, chain, or peer relationships that influence this decision. The Base level is appropriate given the information available.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of input, leading directly to **SQL Injection**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the manipulation of the 'Name' argument leads to **SQL injection** in the /pages/supplier_add.php file of Campcodes Sales and Inventory System 1.0. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that the root cause is insufficient user input validation of the 'name' parameter. The mitigation strategies described, such as using prepared statements and input validation, directly address **SQL injection** vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Retriever Results also strongly suggest CWE-89 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')] as the most relevant CWE, with a score of 1.0 based on alternate terms and high scores from sparse analysis.\n\nCWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] and CWE-434 [Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type] were considered because they appeared in the Retriever Results, but they were not selected because the vulnerability is specifically related to **SQL Injection**, not XSS or file upload issues.\n\nCWE-89 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')] is the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
