## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-4814 Content

The provided content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it does not directly reference CVE-2025-4814. It details a SQL injection vulnerability in "campcodes Sales and Inventory System V1.0" specifically in the `/pages/supplier_add.php` file.  It provides more detail than a typical CVE description.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the 'name' parameter in `/pages/supplier_add.php`. Malicious SQL queries can be injected because the input is used directly in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   System control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable via the 'name' parameter in a POST request to `/pages/supplier_add.php`.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.
*   **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.
*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the least necessary privileges.
*   **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.

**Payload Example:**

```
Parameter: MULTIPART name ((custom) POST)
    Type: boolean-based blind
    Title: MySQL RLIKE boolean-based blind - WHERE, HAVING, ORDER BY or GROUP BY clause
