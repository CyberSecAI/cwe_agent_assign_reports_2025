  "reference_content": "The provided content is related to CVE-2024-6258.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability lies in the `rfcomm_handle_data` function within the `subsys/bluetooth/host/rfcomm.c` file. It occurs because the code does not properly check the remaining length of the `net_buf` after the initial size check.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Missing Length Check:** The `rfcomm_handle_data` function lacks sufficient length checks on the `net_buf` (`buf`).\n- **Undefined Behavior:** The lack of proper length check before using `net_buf_pull_u8(buf)` leads to undefined behavior.\n- **Potential Buffer Over-read/Underflow**: When the buffer length is exactly `sizeof(*hdr) + 1`, the subsequent `net_buf_pull_u8(buf)` will attempt to read past the end of the buffer.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Crash:** The immediate impact of the vulnerability is a crash due to accessing an invalid memory address.\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeated exploitation can lead to denial of service attacks, rendering the affected system unusable.\n- **Instability:** The overall instability of the system could be impacted by this vulnerability.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted Bluetooth RFCOMM frame that causes the `buf` length to be equal to `sizeof(*hdr) + 1`.\n- The attacker needs to send a malicious RFCOMM frame to the affected device.\n- The attack vector is considered adjacent.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- An attacker needs to have a low level of privileges, i.e. be able to send Bluetooth commands to the target.\n- The attack complexity is low.\n- The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of the vulnerable device.",

This is directly supported by the vulnerability description stating \"**Missing length checks of net_buf**\". CWE-130 can lead to CWE-805 (Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value) and subsequently to CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read). The relationship highlights how an initial flaw in handling length parameters propagates to cause a read beyond buffer boundaries.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe130[\"CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\"]\n    cwe805[\"CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    \n    cwe130 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe805\n    cwe805 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe125\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe130 primary\n    class cwe125 secondary\n    class cwe805 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing length checks** (CWE-130). This leads to a scenario where the buffer is accessed with an incorrect length value (CWE-805), ultimately resulting in an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) when `net_buf_pull_u8(buf)` is called with insufficient buffer length.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability lies in the **missing length checks** within the `rfcomm_handle_data` function, as explicitly stated in the vulnerability description and CVE reference. This aligns directly with CWE-130 (Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency). The subsequent out-of-bounds read is a consequence of this primary weakness.\n\nThe evidence supports the classification of CWE-130 as the primary root cause because the vulnerability description states \"**Missing length checks of net_buf**\".\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary also supports this: \"**Missing Length Check:** The `rfcomm_handle_data` function lacks sufficient length checks on the `net_buf` (`buf`).\"\nCWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read is a secondary effect of the primary rootcause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 750.71\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
