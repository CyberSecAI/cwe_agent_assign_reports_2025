NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-11736.\n\n- CVE-2021-21272: ORAS is open source software which enables a way to push OCI Artifacts to OCI Conformant registries. ORAS is both a CLI for initial testing and a Go Module. In ORAS from version 0.4.0 and before version 0.9.0, there is a \"zip-slip\" vulnerability. The directory support feature allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links and hard links. A well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who runs `oras pull`. Users of the affected versions are impacted if they are `oras` CLI users who runs `oras pull`, or if they are Go programs, which invoke `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`. The problem has been fixed in version 0.9.0. For `oras` CLI users, there is no workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider. For `oras` package users, the workaround is to not use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`, and use other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider.\n\n- CVE-2021-28650: autoar-extractor.c in GNOME gnome-autoar before 0.3.1, as used by GNOME Shell, Nautilus, and other software, allows Directory Traversal during extraction because it lacks a check of whether a file's parent is a symlink in certain complex situations. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-36241.\n\n- CVE-2021-32518: A vulnerability in share_link in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote attackers to create a symbolic link then access arbitrary files. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32803: The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.4.15, and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via insufficient symlink protection. `node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-32825: bblfshd is an open source self-hosted server for source code parsing. In bblfshd before commit 4265465b9b6fb5663c30ee43806126012066aad4 there is a \"zipslip\" vulnerability. The unsafe handling of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may enable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations outside the designated target folder. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive file. Additionally, if the attacker has read access to the unpacked files, he may be able to read arbitrary system files the parent process has permissions to read. For more details including a PoC see the referenced GHSL-2020-258.\n\n- CVE-2021-36286: Dell SupportAssist Client Consumer versions 3.9.13.0 and any versions prior to 3.9.13.0 contain an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability that can be exploited by using the Windows feature of NTFS called Symbolic links. Symbolic links can be created by any(non-privileged) user under some object directories, but by themselves are not sufficient to successfully escalate privileges. However, combining them with a different object, such as the NTFS junction point allows for the exploitation. Support assist clean files functionality do not distinguish junction points from the physical folder and proceeds to clean the target of the junction that allows nonprivileged users to create junction points and delete arbitrary files on the system which can be accessed only by the admin.\n\n- CVE-2021-38511: An issue was discovered in the tar crate before 0.4.36 for Rust. When symlinks are present in a TAR archive, extraction can create arbitrary directories via .. traversal.\n\n- CVE-2021-29136: Open Container Initiative umoci before 0.4.7 allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary host paths via a crafted image that causes symlink traversal when \"umoci unpack\" or \"umoci raw unpack\" is used.\n\n- CVE-2020-27833: A Zip Slip vulnerability was found in the oc binary in openshift-clients where an arbitrary file write is achieved by using a specially crafted raw container image (.tar file) which contains symbolic links. The vulnerability is limited to the command `oc image extract`. If a symbolic link is first created pointing within the tarball, this allows further symbolic links to bypass the existing path check. This flaw allows the tarball to create links outside the tarball's parent directory, allowing for executables or configuration files to be overwritten, resulting in arbitrary code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. Versions up to and including openshift-clients-4.7.0-202104250659.p0.git.95881af are affected.\n\n- CVE-2020-27697: Trend Micro Security 2020 (Consumer) contains a vulnerability in the installer package that could be exploited by placing a malicious DLL in a non-protected location with high privileges (symlink attack) which can lead to obtaining administrative privileges during the installation of the product.\n\n- CVE-2020-4717: A vulnerability exists in IBM SPSS Modeler Subscription Installer that allows a user with create symbolic link permission to write arbitrary file in another protected path during product installation. IBM X-Force ID: 187727.\n\n- CVE-2021-23239: The sudoedit personality of Sudo before 1.9.5 may allow a local unprivileged user to perform arbitrary directory-existence tests by winning a sudo_edit.c race condition in replacing a user-controlled directory by a symlink to an arbitrary path.\n\n- CVE-2021-32508: Absolute Path Traversal vulnerability in FileStreaming in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote authenticated attackers access arbitrary files by injecting the Symbolic Link following the Url path parameter. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32509: Absolute Path Traversal vulnerability in FileviewDoc in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote authenticated attackers access arbitrary files by injecting the Symbolic Link following the Url path parameter.

It affects multi-user setups in which \u2019guix-daemon\u2019 runs locally. The attack consists in having an unprivileged user spawn a build process, for instance with `guix build`, that makes its build directory world-writable. The user then creates a hardlink to a root-owned file such as /etc/shadow in that build directory. If the user passed the --keep-failed option and the build eventually fails, the daemon changes ownership of the whole build tree, including the hardlink, to the user. At that point, the user has write access to the target file. Versions after and including v0.11.0-3298-g2608e40988, and versions prior to v1.2.0-75109-g94f0312546 are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2020-28007: Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Execution with Unnecessary Privileges. Because Exim operates as root in the log directory (owned by a non-root user), a symlink or hard link attack allows overwriting critical root-owned files anywhere on the filesystem.\n\n- CVE-2021-22488: There is an Unauthorized file access vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability by modifying soft links may tamper with the files restored from backups.\n\n- CVE-2021-23872: Privilege Escalation vulnerability in the File Lock component of McAfee Total Protection (MTP) prior to 16.0.32 allows a local user to gain elevated privileges by manipulating a symbolic link in the IOCTL interface.\n\n- CVE-2021-23873: Privilege Escalation vulnerability in McAfee Total Protection (MTP) prior to 16.0.30 allows a local user to gain elevated privileges and perform arbitrary file deletion as the SYSTEM user potentially causing Denial of Service via manipulating Junction link, after enumerating certain files, at a specific time.\n\n- CVE-2021-34408: The Zoom Client for Meetings for Windows in all versions before version 5.3.2 writes log files to a user writable directory as a privileged user during the installation or update of the client.

This vulnerability may potentially allow any local user to access system functionality and configuration information that should only be available to a privileged user. Affects versions 8.0.0.0 through 8.1.3.1 of AVPU.\n\n- CVE-2021-21290: Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. In Netty before version 4.1.59.Final there is a vulnerability on Unix-like systems involving an insecure temp file. When netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such, writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the file/directory permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems. The method \"File.createTempFile\" on unix-like systems creates a random file, but, by default will create this file with the permissions \"-rw-r--r--\". Thus, if sensitive information is written to this file, other local users can read this information. This is the case in netty's \"AbstractDiskHttpData\" is vulnerable. This has been fixed in version 4.1.59.Final. As a workaround, one may specify your own \"java.io.tmpdir\" when you start the JVM or use \"DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...)\" to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.\n\n- CVE-2022-45935: Usage of temporary files with insecure permissions by the Apache James server allows an attacker with local access to access private user data in transit. Vulnerable components includes the SMTP stack and IMAP APPEND command. This issue affects Apache James server version 3.7.2 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-4817: A vulnerability was found in centic9 jgit-cookbook. It has been declared as problematic.

We recommend upgrading past commit https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project/pull/969\n\n- CVE-2022-24823: Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework. The package `io.netty:netty-codec-http` prior to version 4.1.77.Final contains an insufficient fix for CVE-2021-21290. When Netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. This only impacts applications running on Java version 6 and lower. Additionally, this vulnerability impacts code running on Unix-like systems, and very old versions of Mac OSX and Windows as they all share the system temporary directory between all users. Version 4.1.77.Final contains a patch for this vulnerability. As a workaround, specify one's own `java.io.tmpdir` when starting the JVM or use DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...) to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24411: Dell PowerScale OneFS 8.2.2 and above contain an elevation of privilege vulnerability.

Applications can create a hard link from one directory to another directory, called a junction point. They can also create a mapping from a directory to a drive letter, called a mount point. If a file is used by a privileged program, but it can be replaced with a hard link to a sensitive file (e.g., AUTOEXEC.BAT), an attacker could excalate privileges. When the process opens the file, the attacker can assume the privileges of that process, tricking the privileged process to read, modify, or delete the sensitive file, preventing the program from accurately processing data. Note that one can also point to registries and semaphores.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-26426: Privileged service allows attackers to delete unauthorized files using a directory junction, leading to arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM.\n\n- CVE-2020-0863: By creating a mount point and hard links, an attacker can abuse a service to allow users arbitrary file read permissions.\n\n- CVE-2019-1161: Chain: race condition (CWE-362) in anti-malware product allows deletion of files by creating a junction (CWE-1386) and using hard links during the time window in which a temporary file is created and deleted.\n\n- CVE-2014-0568: Escape from sandbox for document reader by using a mountpoint [REF-1264]\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-21919: Windows User Profile Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2022-36336: A link following vulnerability in the scanning function of Trend Micro Apex One and Worry-Free Business Security agents could allow a local attacker to escalate privileges on affected installations. The resolution for this issue has been deployed automatically via ActiveUpdate to customers in an updated Spyware pattern. Customers who are up-to-date on detection patterns are not required to take any additional steps to mitigate this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-0799: Insufficient policy enforcement in Installer in Google Chrome on Windows prior to 99.0.4844.51 allowed a remote attacker to perform local privilege escalation via a crafted offline installer file.\n\n- CVE-2022-34008: Comodo Antivirus 12.2.2.8012 has a quarantine flaw that allows privilege escalation. To escalate privilege, a low-privileged attacker can use an NTFS directory junction to restore a malicious DLL from quarantine into the System32 folder.\n\n- CVE-2022-21895: Windows User Profile Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-59 (ChildOf)",

These features can include memory segmentation, virtual memory, privilege rings, trusted execution environments, and virtual machines, among others. For example, virtual memory provides each process with its own address space, which prevents processes from accessing each other's private data. Many of these features can be used to form hardware-enforced security boundaries between software components.\n\n\nMany commodity processors also share microarchitectural resources that cache (temporarily store) data, which may be confidential. These resources may be shared across processor contexts, including across SMT threads, privilege rings, or others.\n\n\nWhen transient operations allow access to ISA-protected data in a shared microarchitectural resource, this might violate users' expectations of the ISA feature that is bypassed. For example, if transient operations can access a victim's private data in a shared microarchitectural resource, then the operations' microarchitectural side effects may correspond to the accessed data. If an attacker can trigger these transient operations and observe their side effects through a covert channel [REF-1400], then the attacker may be able to infer the victim's private data. Private data could include sensitive program data, OS/VMM data, page table data (such as memory addresses), system configuration data (see Demonstrative Example 3), or any other data that the attacker does not have the required privileges to access.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2017-5715: A fault may allow transient user-mode operations to access kernel data cached in the L1D, potentially exposing the data over a covert channel.\n\n- CVE-2018-3615: A fault may allow transient non-enclave operations to access SGX enclave data cached in the L1D, potentially exposing the data over a covert channel.\n\n- CVE-2019-1135: A TSX Asynchronous Abort may allow transient operations to access architecturally restricted data, potentially exposing the data over a covert channel.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-1420 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-1420 (ChildOf)",

Applications can create a hard link from one directory to another directory, called a junction point. They can also create a mapping from a directory to a drive letter, called a mount point. If a file is used by a privileged program, but it can be replaced with a hard link to a sensitive file (e.g., AUTOEXEC.BAT), an attacker could excalate privileges. When the process opens the file, the attacker can assume the privileges of that process, tricking the privileged process to read, modify, or delete the sensitive file, preventing the program from accurately processing data. Note that one can also point to registries and semaphores.\n",

This often exists in Linux-based code assuming the controlled nature of the root directory (/) or its subdirectories (/etc, etc), or a code that recursively accesses the parent directory. In Windows, the drive root and some of its subdirectories have weak permissions by default, which makes them uncontrolled.\n\n\nIn some Unix-based systems, a PATH might be created that contains an empty element, e.g. by splicing an empty variable into the PATH. This empty element can be interpreted as equivalent to the current working directory, which might be an untrusted search element.\n\n\nIn software package management frameworks (e.g., npm, RubyGems, or PyPi), the framework may identify dependencies on third-party libraries or other packages, then consult a repository that contains the desired package. The framework may search a public repository before a private repository. This could be exploited by attackers by placing a malicious package in the public repository that has the same name as a package from the private repository. The search path might not be directly under control of the developer relying on the framework, but this search order effectively contains an untrusted element.\n",

These features can include memory segmentation, virtual memory, privilege rings, trusted execution environments, and virtual machines, among others. For example, virtual memory provides each process with its own address space, which prevents processes from accessing each other's private data. Many of these features can be used to form hardware-enforced security boundaries between software components.\n\n\nMany commodity processors also share microarchitectural resources that cache (temporarily store) data, which may be confidential. These resources may be shared across processor contexts, including across SMT threads, privilege rings, or others.\n\n\nWhen transient operations allow access to ISA-protected data in a shared microarchitectural resource, this might violate users' expectations of the ISA feature that is bypassed. For example, if transient operations can access a victim's private data in a shared microarchitectural resource, then the operations' microarchitectural side effects may correspond to the accessed data. If an attacker can trigger these transient operations and observe their side effects through a covert channel [REF-1400], then the attacker may be able to infer the victim's private data. Private data could include sensitive program data, OS/VMM data, page table data (such as memory addresses), system configuration data (see Demonstrative Example 3), or any other data that the attacker does not have the required privileges to access.\n",

Applications can create a hard link from one directory to another directory, called a junction point. They can also create a mapping from a directory to a drive letter, called a mount point. If a file is used by a privileged program, but it can be replaced with a hard link to a sensitive file (e.g., AUTOEXEC.BAT), an attacker could excalate privileges. When the process opens the file, the attacker can assume the privileges of that process, tricking the privileged process to read, modify, or delete the sensitive file, preventing the program from accurately processing data. Note that one can also point to registries and semaphores.\n",

This often exists in Linux-based code assuming the controlled nature of the root directory (/) or its subdirectories (/etc, etc), or a code that recursively accesses the parent directory. In Windows, the drive root and some of its subdirectories have weak permissions by default, which makes them uncontrolled.\n\n\nIn some Unix-based systems, a PATH might be created that contains an empty element, e.g. by splicing an empty variable into the PATH. This empty element can be interpreted as equivalent to the current working directory, which might be an untrusted search element.\n\n\nIn software package management frameworks (e.g., npm, RubyGems, or PyPi), the framework may identify dependencies on third-party libraries or other packages, then consult a repository that contains the desired package. The framework may search a public repository before a private repository. This could be exploited by attackers by placing a malicious package in the public repository that has the same name as a package from the private repository. The search path might not be directly under control of the developer relying on the framework, but this search order effectively contains an untrusted element.\n",

For example, virtual memory provides each process with its own address space, which prevents processes from accessing each other's private data. Many of these features can be used to form hardware-enforced security boundaries between software components.\n\n\nMany commodity processors also share microarchitectural resources that cache (temporarily store) data, which may be confidential. These resources may be shared across processor contexts, including across SMT threads, privilege rings, or others.\n\n\nWhen transient operations allow access to ISA-protected data in a shared microarchitectural resource, this might violate users' expectations of the ISA feature that is bypassed. For example, if transient operations can access a victim's private data in a shared microarchitectural resource, then the operations' microarchitectural side effects may correspond to the accessed data. If an attacker can trigger these transient operations and observe their side effects through a covert channel [REF-1400], then the attacker may be able to infer the victim's private data. Private data could include sensitive program data, OS/VMM data, page table data (such as memory addresses), system configuration data (see Demonstrative Example 3), or any other data that the attacker does not have the required privileges to access.\n",

NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-11736.\n\n- CVE-2021-21272: ORAS is open source software which enables a way to push OCI Artifacts to OCI Conformant registries. ORAS is both a CLI for initial testing and a Go Module. In ORAS from version 0.4.0 and before version 0.9.0, there is a \"zip-slip\" vulnerability. The directory support feature allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links and hard links. A well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who runs `oras pull`. Users of the affected versions are impacted if they are `oras` CLI users who runs `oras pull`, or if they are Go programs, which invoke `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`. The problem has been fixed in version 0.9.0. For `oras` CLI users, there is no workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider. For `oras` package users, the workaround is to not use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`, and use other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider.\n\n- CVE-2021-28650: autoar-extractor.c in GNOME gnome-autoar before 0.3.1, as used by GNOME Shell, Nautilus, and other software, allows Directory Traversal during extraction because it lacks a check of whether a file's parent is a symlink in certain complex situations. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-36241.\n\n- CVE-2021-32518: A vulnerability in share_link in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote attackers to create a symbolic link then access arbitrary files. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32803: The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.4.15, and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via insufficient symlink protection. `node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-32825: bblfshd is an open source self-hosted server for source code parsing. In bblfshd before commit 4265465b9b6fb5663c30ee43806126012066aad4 there is a \"zipslip\" vulnerability. The unsafe handling of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may enable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations outside the designated target folder. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive file. Additionally, if the attacker has read access to the unpacked files, he may be able to read arbitrary system files the parent process has permissions to read. For more details including a PoC see the referenced GHSL-2020-258.\n\n- CVE-2021-36286: Dell SupportAssist Client Consumer versions 3.9.13.0 and any versions prior to 3.9.13.0 contain an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability that can be exploited by using the Windows feature of NTFS called Symbolic links. Symbolic links can be created by any(non-privileged) user under some object directories, but by themselves are not sufficient to successfully escalate privileges. However, combining them with a different object, such as the NTFS junction point allows for the exploitation. Support assist clean files functionality do not distinguish junction points from the physical folder and proceeds to clean the target of the junction that allows nonprivileged users to create junction points and delete arbitrary files on the system which can be accessed only by the admin.\n\n- CVE-2021-38511: An issue was discovered in the tar crate before 0.4.36 for Rust. When symlinks are present in a TAR archive, extraction can create arbitrary directories via .. traversal.\n\n- CVE-2021-29136: Open Container Initiative umoci before 0.4.7 allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary host paths via a crafted image that causes symlink traversal when \"umoci unpack\" or \"umoci raw unpack\" is used.\n\n- CVE-2020-27833: A Zip Slip vulnerability was found in the oc binary in openshift-clients where an arbitrary file write is achieved by using a specially crafted raw container image (.tar file) which contains symbolic links. The vulnerability is limited to the command `oc image extract`. If a symbolic link is first created pointing within the tarball, this allows further symbolic links to bypass the existing path check. This flaw allows the tarball to create links outside the tarball's parent directory, allowing for executables or configuration files to be overwritten, resulting in arbitrary code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. Versions up to and including openshift-clients-4.7.0-202104250659.p0.git.95881af are affected.\n\n- CVE-2020-27697: Trend Micro Security 2020 (Consumer) contains a vulnerability in the installer package that could be exploited by placing a malicious DLL in a non-protected location with high privileges (symlink attack) which can lead to obtaining administrative privileges during the installation of the product.\n\n- CVE-2020-4717: A vulnerability exists in IBM SPSS Modeler Subscription Installer that allows a user with create symbolic link permission to write arbitrary file in another protected path during product installation. IBM X-Force ID: 187727.\n\n- CVE-2021-23239: The sudoedit personality of Sudo before 1.9.5 may allow a local unprivileged user to perform arbitrary directory-existence tests by winning a sudo_edit.c race condition in replacing a user-controlled directory by a symlink to an arbitrary path.\n\n- CVE-2021-32508: Absolute Path Traversal vulnerability in FileStreaming in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote authenticated attackers access arbitrary files by injecting the Symbolic Link following the Url path parameter. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32509: Absolute Path Traversal vulnerability in FileviewDoc in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote authenticated attackers access arbitrary files by injecting the Symbolic Link following the Url path parameter. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-24084: Windows Mobile Device Management Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-1642: Windows AppX Deployment Extensions Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-1685: Windows AppX Deployment Extensions Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-1695: Windows Print Spooler Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-1697: Windows InstallService Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-1729: Windows Update Stack Setup Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26425: Windows Event Tracing Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26426: Windows User Account Profile Picture Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26862: Windows Installer Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26866: Windows Update Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26873: Windows User Profile Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26887: <p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows when Folder redirection has been enabled via Group Policy. When folder redirection file server is co-located with Terminal server, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability would be able to begin redirecting another user's personal data to a created folder.</p> <p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker can create a new folder under the Folder Redirection root path and create a junction on a newly created User folder.

It affects multi-user setups in which \u2019guix-daemon\u2019 runs locally. The attack consists in having an unprivileged user spawn a build process, for instance with `guix build`, that makes its build directory world-writable. The user then creates a hardlink to a root-owned file such as /etc/shadow in that build directory. If the user passed the --keep-failed option and the build eventually fails, the daemon changes ownership of the whole build tree, including the hardlink, to the user. At that point, the user has write access to the target file. Versions after and including v0.11.0-3298-g2608e40988, and versions prior to v1.2.0-75109-g94f0312546 are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2020-28007: Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Execution with Unnecessary Privileges. Because Exim operates as root in the log directory (owned by a non-root user), a symlink or hard link attack allows overwriting critical root-owned files anywhere on the filesystem.\n\n- CVE-2021-22488: There is an Unauthorized file access vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability by modifying soft links may tamper with the files restored from backups.\n\n- CVE-2021-23872: Privilege Escalation vulnerability in the File Lock component of McAfee Total Protection (MTP) prior to 16.0.32 allows a local user to gain elevated privileges by manipulating a symbolic link in the IOCTL interface.\n\n- CVE-2021-23873: Privilege Escalation vulnerability in McAfee Total Protection (MTP) prior to 16.0.30 allows a local user to gain elevated privileges and perform arbitrary file deletion as the SYSTEM user potentially causing Denial of Service via manipulating Junction link, after enumerating certain files, at a specific time.\n\n- CVE-2021-34408: The Zoom Client for Meetings for Windows in all versions before version 5.3.2 writes log files to a user writable directory as a privileged user during the installation or update of the client. This could allow for potential privilege escalation if a link was created between the user writable directory used and a non-user writable directory.\n\n- CVE-2021-36744: Trend Micro Security (Consumer) 2021 and 2020 are vulnerable to a directory junction vulnerability which could allow an attacker to exploit the system to escalate privileges and create a denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2021-37969: Inappropriate implementation in Google Updater in Google Chrome on Windows prior to 94.0.4606.54 allowed a remote attacker to perform local privilege escalation via a crafted file.\n\n- CVE-2021-44038: An issue was discovered in Quagga through 1.2.4.

This vulnerability may potentially allow any local user to access system functionality and configuration information that should only be available to a privileged user. Affects versions 8.0.0.0 through 8.1.3.1 of AVPU.\n\n- CVE-2021-21290: Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. In Netty before version 4.1.59.Final there is a vulnerability on Unix-like systems involving an insecure temp file. When netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such, writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the file/directory permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems. The method \"File.createTempFile\" on unix-like systems creates a random file, but, by default will create this file with the permissions \"-rw-r--r--\". Thus, if sensitive information is written to this file, other local users can read this information. This is the case in netty's \"AbstractDiskHttpData\" is vulnerable. This has been fixed in version 4.1.59.Final. As a workaround, one may specify your own \"java.io.tmpdir\" when you start the JVM or use \"DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...)\" to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.\n\n- CVE-2022-45935: Usage of temporary files with insecure permissions by the Apache James server allows an attacker with local access to access private user data in transit. Vulnerable components includes the SMTP stack and IMAP APPEND command. This issue affects Apache James server version 3.7.2 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-4817: A vulnerability was found in centic9 jgit-cookbook. It has been declared as problematic. This vulnerability affects unknown code. The manipulation leads to insecure temporary file. The attack can be initiated remotely. The name of the patch is b8cb29b43dc704708d598c60ac1881db7cf8e9c3. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-216988.\n\n- CVE-2021-22572: On unix-like systems, the system temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. The root cause is File.createTempFile creates files in the the system temporary directory with world readable permissions. Any sensitive information written to theses files is visible to all other local users on unix-like systems. We recommend upgrading past commit https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project/pull/969\n\n- CVE-2022-24823: Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework. The package `io.netty:netty-codec-http` prior to version 4.1.77.Final contains an insufficient fix for CVE-2021-21290. When Netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. This only impacts applications running on Java version 6 and lower. Additionally, this vulnerability impacts code running on Unix-like systems, and very old versions of Mac OSX and Windows as they all share the system temporary directory between all users. Version 4.1.77.Final contains a patch for this vulnerability. As a workaround, specify one's own `java.io.tmpdir` when starting the JVM or use DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...) to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24411: Dell PowerScale OneFS 8.2.2 and above contain an elevation of privilege vulnerability.

Applications can create a hard link from one directory to another directory, called a junction point. They can also create a mapping from a directory to a drive letter, called a mount point. If a file is used by a privileged program, but it can be replaced with a hard link to a sensitive file (e.g., AUTOEXEC.BAT), an attacker could excalate privileges. When the process opens the file, the attacker can assume the privileges of that process, tricking the privileged process to read, modify, or delete the sensitive file, preventing the program from accurately processing data. Note that one can also point to registries and semaphores.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-26426: Privileged service allows attackers to delete unauthorized files using a directory junction, leading to arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM.\n\n- CVE-2020-0863: By creating a mount point and hard links, an attacker can abuse a service to allow users arbitrary file read permissions.\n\n- CVE-2019-1161: Chain: race condition (CWE-362) in anti-malware product allows deletion of files by creating a junction (CWE-1386) and using hard links during the time window in which a temporary file is created and deleted.\n\n- CVE-2014-0568: Escape from sandbox for document reader by using a mountpoint [REF-1264]\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-21919: Windows User Profile Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2022-36336: A link following vulnerability in the scanning function of Trend Micro Apex One and Worry-Free Business Security agents could allow a local attacker to escalate privileges on affected installations.

These features can include memory segmentation, virtual memory, privilege rings, trusted execution environments, and virtual machines, among others. For example, virtual memory provides each process with its own address space, which prevents processes from accessing each other's private data. Many of these features can be used to form hardware-enforced security boundaries between software components.\n\n\nMany commodity processors also share microarchitectural resources that cache (temporarily store) data, which may be confidential. These resources may be shared across processor contexts, including across SMT threads, privilege rings, or others.\n\n\nWhen transient operations allow access to ISA-protected data in a shared microarchitectural resource, this might violate users' expectations of the ISA feature that is bypassed. For example, if transient operations can access a victim's private data in a shared microarchitectural resource, then the operations' microarchitectural side effects may correspond to the accessed data. If an attacker can trigger these transient operations and observe their side effects through a covert channel [REF-1400], then the attacker may be able to infer the victim's private data. Private data could include sensitive program data, OS/VMM data, page table data (such as memory addresses), system configuration data (see Demonstrative Example 3), or any other data that the attacker does not have the required privileges to access.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2017-5715: A fault may allow transient user-mode operations to access kernel data cached in the L1D, potentially exposing the data over a covert channel.\n\n- CVE-2018-3615: A fault may allow transient non-enclave operations to access SGX enclave data cached in the L1D, potentially exposing the data over a covert channel.\n\n- CVE-2019-1135: A TSX Asynchronous Abort may allow transient operations to access architecturally restricted data, potentially exposing the data over a covert channel.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-1420 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-1420 (ChildOf)",

An overflow in a global variable (sBuffer) leads to a Write-What-Where outcome. Writing beyond sBuffer will clobber most global variables until reaching a pointer such as DES_info or image_info. By controlling that pointer, one achieves an arbitrary write when its fields are assigned. The data written is from a potentially untrusted NITF file in the form of an integer. The attacker can gain control of the instruction pointer.\n\n- CVE-2021-27043: An Arbitrary Address Write issue in the Autodesk DWG application can allow a malicious user to leverage the application to write in unexpected paths.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have a valid account on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the affected software incorrectly runs the SFTP user service at the privilege level of the account that was running when the ConfD built-in Secure Shell (SSH) server for CLI was enabled. If the ConfD built-in SSH server was not enabled, the device is not affected by this vulnerability. An attacker with low-level privileges could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and issuing a series of commands at the SFTP interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to the level of the account under which ConfD is running, which is commonly root. Note: Any user who can authenticate to the built-in SSH server may exploit this vulnerability. By default, all ConfD users have this access if the server is enabled. Software updates that address this vulnerability have been released.\n\n- CVE-2021-31168: Windows Container Manager Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-31169: Windows Container Manager Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-40124: A vulnerability in the Network Access Manager (NAM) module of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to escalate privileges on an affected device.

It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-706\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Theoretical]** \n\nLink following vulnerabilities are Multi-factor Vulnerabilities (MFV). They are the combination of multiple elements: file or directory permissions, filename predictability, race conditions, and in some cases, a design limitation in which there is no mechanism for performing atomic file creation operations.\n\n\nSome potential factors are race conditions, permissions, and predictability.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1386:** Some versions of Perl follow symbolic links when running with the -e option, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.\n- **CVE-2000-1178:** Text editor follows symbolic links when creating a rescue copy during an abnormal exit, which allows local users to overwrite the files of other users.\n- **CVE-2004-0217:** Antivirus update allows local users to create or append to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a logfile.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nOpening temporary files without appropriate measures or controls can leave the file, its contents and any function that it impacts vulnerable to attack.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-377\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-24823:** A network application framework uses the Java function createTempFile(), which will create a file that is readable by other local users of the system\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1386: Insecure Operation on Windows Junction / Mount Point\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product opens a file or directory, but it does not properly prevent the name from being associated with a junction or mount point to a destination that is outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nDepending on the intended action being performed, this could allow an attacker to cause the product to read, write, delete, or otherwise operate on unauthorized files.\n\n\nIn Windows, NTFS5 allows for file system objects called reparse points. Applications can create a hard link from one directory to another directory, called a junction point. They can also create a mapping from a directory to a drive letter, called a mount point. If a file is used by a privileged program, but it can be replaced with a hard link to a sensitive file (e.g., AUTOEXEC.BAT), an attacker could excalate privileges. When the process opens the file, the attacker can assume the privileges of that process, tricking the privileged process to read, modify, or delete the sensitive file, preventing the program from accurately processing data. Note that one can also point to registries and semaphores.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-59\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** Symbolic links, hard links, junctions, and mount points can be confusing terminology, as there are differences in how they operate between UNIX-based systems and Windows, and there are interactions between them.\n\n**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-26426:** Privileged service allows attackers to delete unauthorized files using a directory junction, leading to arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM.\n- **CVE-2020-0863:** By creating a mount point and hard links, an attacker can abuse a service to allow users arbitrary file read permissions.\n- **CVE-2019-1161:** Chain: race condition (CWE-362) in anti-malware product allows deletion of files by creating a junction (CWE-1386) and using hard links during the time window in which a temporary file is created and deleted.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1421: Exposure of Sensitive Information in Shared Microarchitectural Structures during Transient Execution\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\n\n\t\t\tA processor event may allow transient operations to access\n\t\t\tarchitecturally restricted data (for example, in another address\n\t\t\tspace) in a shared microarchitectural structure (for example, a CPU\n\t\t\tcache), potentially exposing the data over a covert channel.\n\t\t  \n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany commodity processors have Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) features that protect software components from one another. These features can include memory segmentation, virtual memory, privilege rings, trusted execution environments, and virtual machines, among others. For example, virtual memory provides each process with its own address space, which prevents processes from accessing each other's private data. Many of these features can be used to form hardware-enforced security boundaries between software components.\n\n\nMany commodity processors also share microarchitectural resources that cache (temporarily store) data, which may be confidential. These resources may be shared across processor contexts, including across SMT threads, privilege rings, or others.\n\n\nWhen transient operations allow access to ISA-protected data in a shared microarchitectural resource, this might violate users' expectations of the ISA feature that is bypassed. For example, if transient operations can access a victim's private data in a shared microarchitectural resource, then the operations' microarchitectural side effects may correspond to the accessed data. If an attacker can trigger these transient operations and observe their side effects through a covert channel [REF-1400], then the attacker may be able to infer the victim's private data. Private data could include sensitive program data, OS/VMM data, page table data (such as memory addresses), system configuration data (see Demonstrative Example 3), or any other data that the attacker does not have the required privileges to access.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1420\nChildOf -> CWE-1420\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities\n**Comments:** If a weakness can potentially be exploited to infer data that is accessible inside or outside the current processor context, then the weakness could map to CWE-1421 and to another CWE such as CWE-1420.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2017-5715:** A fault may allow transient user-mode operations to access kernel data cached in the L1D, potentially exposing the data over a covert channel.\n- **CVE-2018-3615:** A fault may allow transient non-enclave operations to access SGX enclave data cached in the L1D, potentially exposing the data over a covert channel.\n- **CVE-2019-1135:** A TSX Asynchronous Abort may allow transient operations to access architecturally restricted data, potentially exposing the data over a covert channel.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-454: External Initialization of Trusted Variables or Data Stores\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product initializes critical internal variables or data stores using inputs that can be modified by untrusted actors.\n\n### Extended Description\nA product system should be reluctant to trust variables that have been initialized outside of its trust boundary, especially if they are initialized by users. The variables may have been initialized incorrectly. If an attacker can initialize the variable, then they can influence what the vulnerable system will do.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1419\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-456\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Overlaps Missing variable initialization, especially in PHP.\n\n**[Applicable Platform]** \n\nThis is often found in PHP due to register_globals and the common practice of storing library/include files under the web document root so that they are available using a direct request.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-43468:** WordPress module sets internal variables based on external inputs, allowing false reporting of the number of views\n- **CVE-2000-0959:** Does not clear dangerous environment variables, enabling symlink attack.\n- **CVE-2001-0033:** Specify alternate configuration directory in environment variable, enabling untrusted path.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1274: Improper Access Control for Volatile Memory Containing Boot Code\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product conducts a secure-boot process that transfers bootloader code from Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) into Volatile Memory (VM), but it does not have sufficient access control or other protections for the Volatile Memory.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAdversaries could bypass the secure-boot process and execute their own untrusted, malicious boot code.\n\n\nAs a part of a secure-boot process, the read-only-memory (ROM) code for a System-on-Chip (SoC) or other system fetches bootloader code from Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) and stores the code in Volatile Memory (VM), such as dynamic, random-access memory (DRAM) or static, random-access memory (SRAM). The NVM is usually external to the SoC, while the VM is internal to the SoC. As the code is transferred from NVM to VM, it is authenticated by the SoC's ROM code.\n\n\nIf the volatile-memory-region protections or access controls are insufficient to prevent modifications from an adversary or untrusted agent, the secure boot may be bypassed or replaced with the execution of an adversary's code.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2019-2267:** Locked memory regions may be modified through other interfaces in a secure-boot-loader image due to improper access control.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-363: Race Condition Enabling Link Following\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product checks the status of a file or directory before accessing it, which produces a race condition in which the file can be replaced with a link before the access is performed, causing the product to access the wrong file.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhile developers might expect that there is a very narrow time window between the time of check and time of use, there is still a race condition. An attacker could cause the product to slow down (e.g. with memory consumption), causing the time window to become larger. Alternately, in some situations, the attacker could win the race by performing a large number of attacks.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-367\nCanPrecede -> CWE-59\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is already covered by the \"Link Following\" weakness (CWE-59). It is included here because so many people associate race conditions with link problems; however, not all link following issues involve race conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-127: Buffer Under-read\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations prior to the targeted buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis typically occurs when the pointer or its index is decremented to a position before the buffer, when pointer arithmetic results in a position before the beginning of the valid memory location, or when a negative index is used. This may result in exposure of sensitive information or possibly a crash.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-125\nChildOf -> CWE-786\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** Under-studied.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-40985:** HTML conversion package has a buffer under-read, allowing a crash\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-426: Untrusted Search Path\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product searches for critical resources using an externally-supplied search path that can point to resources that are not under the product's direct control.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis might allow attackers to execute their own programs, access unauthorized data files, or modify configuration in unexpected ways. If the product uses a search path to locate critical resources such as programs, then an attacker could modify that search path to point to a malicious program, which the targeted product would then execute. The problem extends to any type of critical resource that the product trusts.\n\n\nSome of the most common variants of untrusted search path are:\n\n\n  - In various UNIX and Linux-based systems, the PATH environment variable may be consulted to locate executable programs, and LD_PRELOAD may be used to locate a separate library.\n\n  - In various Microsoft-based systems, the PATH environment variable is consulted to locate a DLL, if the DLL is not found in other paths that appear earlier in the search order.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nUntrusted Path\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-642\nChildOf -> CWE-668\nChildOf -> CWE-673\nPeerOf -> CWE-427\nPeerOf -> CWE-428\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1120:** Application relies on its PATH environment variable to find and execute program.\n- **CVE-2008-1810:** Database application relies on its PATH environment variable to find and execute program.\n- **CVE-2007-2027:** Chain: untrusted search path enabling resultant format string by loading malicious internationalization messages.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nAny condition where the attacker has the ability to write an arbitrary value to an arbitrary location, often as the result of a buffer overflow.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-787\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-11736.\n\n- CVE-2021-21272: ORAS is open source software which enables a way to push OCI Artifacts to OCI Conformant registries. ORAS is both a CLI for initial testing and a Go Module. In ORAS from version 0.4.0 and before version 0.9.0, there is a \"zip-slip\" vulnerability. The directory support feature allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links and hard links. A well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who runs `oras pull`. Users of the affected versions are impacted if they are `oras` CLI users who runs `oras pull`, or if they are Go programs, which invoke `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`. The problem has been fixed in version 0.9.0. For `oras` CLI users, there is no workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider. For `oras` package users, the workaround is to not use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`, and use other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider.\n\n- CVE-2021-28650: autoar-extractor.c in GNOME gnome-autoar before 0.3.1, as used by GNOME Shell, Nautilus, and other software, allows Directory Traversal during extraction because it lacks a check of whether a file's parent is a symlink in certain complex situations. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-36241.\n\n- CVE-2021-32518: A vulnerability in share_link in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote attackers to create a symbolic link then access arbitrary files. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32803: The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.4.15, and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via insufficient symlink protection. `node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-32825: bblfshd is an open source self-hosted server for source code parsing. In bblfshd before commit 4265465b9b6fb5663c30ee43806126012066aad4 there is a \"zipslip\" vulnerability. The unsafe handling of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may enable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations outside the designated target folder. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive file. Additionally, if the attacker has read access to the unpacked files, he may be able to read arbitrary system files the parent process has permissions to read. For more details including a PoC see the referenced GHSL-2020-258.\n\n- CVE-2021-36286: Dell SupportAssist Client Consumer versions 3.9.13.0 and any versions prior to 3.9.13.0 contain an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability that can be exploited by using the Windows feature of NTFS called Symbolic links. Symbolic links can be created by any(non-privileged) user under some object directories, but by themselves are not sufficient to successfully escalate privileges. However, combining them with a different object, such as the NTFS junction point allows for the exploitation. Support assist clean files functionality do not distinguish junction points from the physical folder and proceeds to clean the target of the junction that allows nonprivileged users to create junction points and delete arbitrary files on the system which can be accessed only by the admin.\n\n- CVE-2021-38511: An issue was discovered in the tar crate before 0.4.36 for Rust. When symlinks are present in a TAR archive, extraction can create arbitrary directories via .. traversal.\n\n- CVE-2021-29136: Open Container Initiative umoci before 0.4.7 allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary host paths via a crafted image that causes symlink traversal when \"umoci unpack\" or \"umoci raw unpack\" is used.\n\n- CVE-2020-27833: A Zip Slip vulnerability was found in the oc binary in openshift-clients where an arbitrary file write is achieved by using a specially crafted raw container image (.tar file) which contains symbolic links. The vulnerability is limited to the command `oc image extract`. If a symbolic link is first created pointing within the tarball, this allows further symbolic links to bypass the existing path check. This flaw allows the tarball to create links outside the tarball's parent directory, allowing for executables or configuration files to be overwritten, resulting in arbitrary code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. Versions up to and including openshift-clients-4.7.0-202104250659.p0.git.95881af are affected.\n\n- CVE-2020-27697: Trend Micro Security 2020 (Consumer) contains a vulnerability in the installer package that could be exploited by placing a malicious DLL in a non-protected location with high privileges (symlink attack) which can lead to obtaining administrative privileges during the installation of the product.\n\n- CVE-2020-4717: A vulnerability exists in IBM SPSS Modeler Subscription Installer that allows a user with create symbolic link permission to write arbitrary file in another protected path during product installation. IBM X-Force ID: 187727.\n\n- CVE-2021-23239: The sudoedit personality of Sudo before 1.9.5 may allow a local unprivileged user to perform arbitrary directory-existence tests by winning a sudo_edit.c race condition in replacing a user-controlled directory by a symlink to an arbitrary path.\n\n- CVE-2021-32508: Absolute Path Traversal vulnerability in FileStreaming in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote authenticated attackers access arbitrary files by injecting the Symbolic Link following the Url path parameter. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32509: Absolute Path Traversal vulnerability in FileviewDoc in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote authenticated attackers access arbitrary files by injecting the Symbolic Link following the Url path parameter. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-24084: Windows Mobile Device Management Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-1642: Windows AppX Deployment Extensions Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-1685: Windows AppX Deployment Extensions Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-1695: Windows Print Spooler Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-1697: Windows InstallService Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-1729: Windows Update Stack Setup Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26425: Windows Event Tracing Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26426: Windows User Account Profile Picture Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26862: Windows Installer Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26866: Windows Update Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26873: Windows User Profile Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26887: <p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows when Folder redirection has been enabled via Group Policy. When folder redirection file server is co-located with Terminal server, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability would be able to begin redirecting another user's personal data to a created folder.</p> <p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker can create a new folder under the Folder Redirection root path and create a junction on a newly created User folder. When the new user logs in, Folder Redirection would start redirecting to the folder and copying personal data.</p> <p>This elevation of privilege vulnerability can only be addressed by reconfiguring Folder Redirection with Offline files and restricting permissions, and NOT via a security update for affected Windows Servers.

It affects multi-user setups in which \u2019guix-daemon\u2019 runs locally. The attack consists in having an unprivileged user spawn a build process, for instance with `guix build`, that makes its build directory world-writable. The user then creates a hardlink to a root-owned file such as /etc/shadow in that build directory. If the user passed the --keep-failed option and the build eventually fails, the daemon changes ownership of the whole build tree, including the hardlink, to the user. At that point, the user has write access to the target file.

This vulnerability may potentially allow any local user to access system functionality and configuration information that should only be available to a privileged user. Affects versions 8.0.0.0 through 8.1.3.1 of AVPU.\n\n- CVE-2021-21290: Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. In Netty before version 4.1.59.Final there is a vulnerability on Unix-like systems involving an insecure temp file. When netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such, writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the file/directory permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems. The method \"File.createTempFile\" on unix-like systems creates a random file, but, by default will create this file with the permissions \"-rw-r--r--\". Thus, if sensitive information is written to this file, other local users can read this information. This is the case in netty's \"AbstractDiskHttpData\" is vulnerable. This has been fixed in version 4.1.59.Final. As a workaround, one may specify your own \"java.io.tmpdir\" when you start the JVM or use \"DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...)\" to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.\n\n- CVE-2022-45935: Usage of temporary files with insecure permissions by the Apache James server allows an attacker with local access to access private user data in transit. Vulnerable components includes the SMTP stack and IMAP APPEND command.

It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-216988.\n\n- CVE-2021-22572: On unix-like systems, the system temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. The root cause is File.createTempFile creates files in the the system temporary directory with world readable permissions. Any sensitive information written to theses files is visible to all other local users on unix-like systems. We recommend upgrading past commit https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project/pull/969\n\n- CVE-2022-24823: Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework. The package `io.netty:netty-codec-http` prior to version 4.1.77.Final contains an insufficient fix for CVE-2021-21290. When Netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. This only impacts applications running on Java version 6 and lower. Additionally, this vulnerability impacts code running on Unix-like systems, and very old versions of Mac OSX and Windows as they all share the system temporary directory between all users. Version 4.1.77.Final contains a patch for this vulnerability. As a workaround, specify one's own `java.io.tmpdir` when starting the JVM or use DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...) to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24411: Dell PowerScale OneFS 8.2.2 and above contain an elevation of privilege vulnerability. A local attacker with ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_SSH and/or ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_CONSOLE could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to elevation of privilege.

These features can include memory segmentation, virtual memory, privilege rings, trusted execution environments, and virtual machines, among others. For example, virtual memory provides each process with its own address space, which prevents processes from accessing each other's private data. Many of these features can be used to form hardware-enforced security boundaries between software components.\n\n\nMany commodity processors also share microarchitectural resources that cache (temporarily store) data, which may be confidential. These resources may be shared across processor contexts, including across SMT threads, privilege rings, or others.\n\n\nWhen transient operations allow access to ISA-protected data in a shared microarchitectural resource, this might violate users' expectations of the ISA feature that is bypassed. For example, if transient operations can access a victim's private data in a shared microarchitectural resource, then the operations' microarchitectural side effects may correspond to the accessed data. If an attacker can trigger these transient operations and observe their side effects through a covert channel [REF-1400], then the attacker may be able to infer the victim's private data. Private data could include sensitive program data, OS/VMM data, page table data (such as memory addresses), system configuration data (see Demonstrative Example 3), or any other data that the attacker does not have the required privileges to access.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2017-5715: A fault may allow transient user-mode operations to access kernel data cached in the L1D, potentially exposing the data over a covert channel.\n\n- CVE-2018-3615: A fault may allow transient non-enclave operations to access SGX enclave data cached in the L1D, potentially exposing the data over a covert channel.\n\n- CVE-2019-1135: A TSX Asynchronous Abort may allow transient operations to access architecturally restricted data, potentially exposing the data over a covert channel.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-1420 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-1420 (ChildOf)",

The problem extends to any type of critical resource that the product trusts.\n\n\nSome of the most common variants of untrusted search path are:\n\n\n  - In various UNIX and Linux-based systems, the PATH environment variable may be consulted to locate executable programs, and LD_PRELOAD may be used to locate a separate library.\n\n  - In various Microsoft-based systems, the PATH environment variable is consulted to locate a DLL, if the DLL is not found in other paths that appear earlier in the search order.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-1999-1120: Application relies on its PATH environment variable to find and execute program.\n\n- CVE-2008-1810: Database application relies on its PATH environment variable to find and execute program.\n\n- CVE-2007-2027: Chain: untrusted search path enabling resultant format string by loading malicious internationalization messages.\n\n- CVE-2008-3485: Untrusted search path using malicious .EXE in Windows environment.\n\n- CVE-2008-2613: setuid program allows compromise using path that finds and loads a malicious library.\n\n- CVE-2008-1319: Server allows client to specify the search path, which can be modified to point to a program that the client has uploaded.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-41387: seatd-launch in seatd 0.6.x before 0.6.2 allows privilege escalation because it uses execlp and may be installed setuid root.\n\n- CVE-2021-28249: CA eHealth Performance Manager through 6.3.2.12 is affected by Privilege Escalation via a Dynamically Linked Shared Object Library. To exploit the vulnerability, the ehealth user must create a malicious library in the writable RPATH, to be dynamically linked when the FtpCollector executable is run. The code in the library will be executed as the root user. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer\n\n- CVE-2022-22047: Windows Client Server Run-time Subsystem (CSRSS) Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-3305: Beijing Feishu Technology Co., Ltd Feishu v3.40.3 was discovered to contain an untrusted search path vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-36403: Untrusted search path vulnerability in the installer of Device Software Manager prior to Ver.2.20.3.0 allows an attacker to gain privileges via a Trojan horse DLL in an unspecified directory.\n\n- CVE-2021-36666: An issue was discovered in Druva 6.9.0 for MacOS, allows attackers to gain escalated local privileges via the inSyncDecommission.\n\n- CVE-2022-38060: A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the sudo functionality of OpenStack Kolla git master 05194e7618. A misconfiguration in /etc/sudoers within a container can lead to increased privileges.\n\n- CVE-2022-25366: Cryptomator through 1.6.5 allows DYLIB injection because, although it has the flag 0x1000 for Hardened Runtime, it has the com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation and com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables entitlements. An attacker can exploit this by creating a malicious .dylib file that can be executed via the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable.\n\n- CVE-2022-39245: Mist is the command-line interface for the makedeb Package Repository. Prior to version 0.9.5, a user-provided `sudo` binary via the `PATH` variable can allow a local user to run arbitrary commands on the user's system with root permissions. Versions 0.9.5 and later contain a patch. No known workarounds exist.\n\n- CVE-2021-21817: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Zebra IP Routing Manager functionality of D-LINK DIR-3040 1.13B03. A specially crafted network request can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. An attacker can send a sequence of requests to trigger this vulnerability.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-642 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-668 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-673 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-427 (PeerOf)\n\n- CWE-428 (PeerOf)",

An overflow in a global variable (sBuffer) leads to a Write-What-Where outcome. Writing beyond sBuffer will clobber most global variables until reaching a pointer such as DES_info or image_info. By controlling that pointer, one achieves an arbitrary write when its fields are assigned. The data written is from a potentially untrusted NITF file in the form of an integer. The attacker can gain control of the instruction pointer.\n\n- CVE-2021-27043: An Arbitrary Address Write issue in the Autodesk DWG application can allow a malicious user to leverage the application to write in unexpected paths. In order to exploit this the attacker would need the victim to enable full page heap in the application.\n\n- CVE-2020-0986: An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows kernel fails to properly handle objects in memory, aka 'Windows Kernel Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability'.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have a valid account on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the affected software incorrectly runs the SFTP user service at the privilege level of the account that was running when the ConfD built-in Secure Shell (SSH) server for CLI was enabled. If the ConfD built-in SSH server was not enabled, the device is not affected by this vulnerability. An attacker with low-level privileges could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and issuing a series of commands at the SFTP interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to the level of the account under which ConfD is running, which is commonly root. Note: Any user who can authenticate to the built-in SSH server may exploit this vulnerability. By default, all ConfD users have this access if the server is enabled. Software updates that address this vulnerability have been released.\n\n- CVE-2021-31168: Windows Container Manager Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-31169: Windows Container Manager Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-40124: A vulnerability in the Network Access Manager (NAM) module of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to escalate privileges on an affected device.

Applications can create a hard link from one directory to another directory, called a junction point. They can also create a mapping from a directory to a drive letter, called a mount point. If a file is used by a privileged program, but it can be replaced with a hard link to a sensitive file (e.g., AUTOEXEC.BAT), an attacker could excalate privileges. When the process opens the file, the attacker can assume the privileges of that process, tricking the privileged process to read, modify, or delete the sensitive file, preventing the program from accurately processing data. Note that one can also point to registries and semaphores.\n",

This often exists in Linux-based code assuming the controlled nature of the root directory (/) or its subdirectories (/etc, etc), or a code that recursively accesses the parent directory. In Windows, the drive root and some of its subdirectories have weak permissions by default, which makes them uncontrolled.\n\n\nIn some Unix-based systems, a PATH might be created that contains an empty element, e.g. by splicing an empty variable into the PATH. This empty element can be interpreted as equivalent to the current working directory, which might be an untrusted search element.\n\n\nIn software package management frameworks (e.g., npm, RubyGems, or PyPi), the framework may identify dependencies on third-party libraries or other packages, then consult a repository that contains the desired package. The framework may search a public repository before a private repository. This could be exploited by attackers by placing a malicious package in the public repository that has the same name as a package from the private repository. The search path might not be directly under control of the developer relying on the framework, but this search order effectively contains an untrusted element.\n",

These features can include memory segmentation, virtual memory, privilege rings, trusted execution environments, and virtual machines, among others. For example, virtual memory provides each process with its own address space, which prevents processes from accessing each other's private data. Many of these features can be used to form hardware-enforced security boundaries between software components.\n\n\nMany commodity processors also share microarchitectural resources that cache (temporarily store) data, which may be confidential. These resources may be shared across processor contexts, including across SMT threads, privilege rings, or others.\n\n\nWhen transient operations allow access to ISA-protected data in a shared microarchitectural resource, this might violate users' expectations of the ISA feature that is bypassed. For example, if transient operations can access a victim's private data in a shared microarchitectural resource, then the operations' microarchitectural side effects may correspond to the accessed data. If an attacker can trigger these transient operations and observe their side effects through a covert channel [REF-1400], then the attacker may be able to infer the victim's private data. Private data could include sensitive program data, OS/VMM data, page table data (such as memory addresses), system configuration data (see Demonstrative Example 3), or any other data that the attacker does not have the required privileges to access.\n",
