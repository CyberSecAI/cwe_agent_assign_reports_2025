There is no clear parent or child relationship.\nThis lack of relationship context reduces confidence, as the absence of related CWEs makes the mapping less certain.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1274[\"CWE-1274: Improper Access Control for Volatile Memory Containing Boot Code\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe1274 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is not fully elucidated due to the limited information. However, based on the description, the chain starts with **improper access control** of volatile memory containing boot code, which can lead to **elevation of privilege** in the Windows VBS Enclave.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identifies CWE-1274 as the primary candidate, aligning with the description of \"Virtualization-Based Security (VBS) Enclave Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability,\" due to the \"Improper Access Control for Volatile Memory Containing Boot Code\" aspect.\n\nThe decision is based on the vulnerability description and the top retriever result, CWE-1274. However, the lack of detailed root cause information and the limited scope of the provided evidence lowers the overall confidence in the assessment.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity based on the available information. Although more detailed information might reveal a more specific root cause, the current evidence supports CWE-1274 as the most appropriate classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
