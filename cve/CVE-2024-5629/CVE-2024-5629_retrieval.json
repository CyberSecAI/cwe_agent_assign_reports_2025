  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-5629', description='An **out-of-bounds read** in the bson module of PyMongo 4.6.2 or earlier allows **deserialization** of malformed BSON provided by a Server to raise an exception which may contain arbitrary application memory.', key_phrases={'rootcause': '', 'weakness': ['deserialization', 'out-of-bounds read'], 'impact': 'arbitrary application memory access', 'vector': 'deserialization of malformed BSON', 'attacker': 'Server', 'product': 'PyMongo', 'version': '4.6.2 or earlier', 'component': 'bson module'}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-5629:\\n\\n**Root Cause:**\\n- An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `bson` module of PyMongo. This occurs during the deserialization of malformed BSON data.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\\n- **Out-of-bounds read:** The vulnerability is specifically an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125). When the PyMongo library attempts to deserialize malformed BSON data, it reads memory outside of the intended buffer.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n- **Information Disclosure:**  The out-of-bounds read can expose arbitrary application memory within the exception message. This information could potentially be sensitive, depending on the contents of the application's memory.\\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** While not explicitly stated as a primary impact, the exception raised during the out-of-bounds read could potentially lead to a denial of service by crashing the application. The CVSS score also suggests a low impact on availability.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- **Network:** The malformed BSON is received from a server. This indicates that an attacker can send malicious BSON data over a network connection to a vulnerable PyMongo client.\\n- **Malicious Server:** An attacker who can control or compromise a server that communicates with a PyMongo client can exploit this vulnerability.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to send crafted BSON data to a PyMongo client.\\n- **Server-Side Control/Compromise:**  The attacker must be able to act as a malicious server or compromise a legitimate server in order to send the malformed BSON.\\n- **Knowledge of BSON:**  The attacker would likely need some understanding of the BSON format in order to create malicious payloads that trigger the out-of-bounds read.\\n\\n**Additional Details:**\\n- **Affected Versions:**  PyMongo versions prior to and including 4.6.2 are vulnerable.\\n- **Fixed Versions:**  The issue is fixed in versions 4.6.3 and 4.7.\\n- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 4.7, with the following vector: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:L`.  This translates to:\\n    -   **AV:N (Network):** The attack vector is through the network.\\n    -   **AC:H (High):** The attack requires specialized conditions or is not easily performed.\\n    -   **PR:N (None):** No privileges are required to perform the attack.\\n    -   **UI:R (Required):** User interaction is required (In this case, the user/application needs to process the malicious BSON).\\n    -  **S:C (Changed):** A successful attack would impact a different resource than the vulnerable component.\\n    -   **C:L (Low):**  Confidentiality impact is low.\\n    -   **I:N (None):** There is no integrity impact.\\n    -   **A:L (Low):** The availability impact is low.\\n- The vulnerability was found externally.\\n- The Debian LTS advisories indicate that the vulnerability also affects versions 3.7.1 and 3.11.0 and have been fixed in `3.7.1-1.1+deb10u1` and `3.11.0-1+deb11u1` respectively.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '119', 'name': 'Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': \"The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary.
