## Vulnerability Description
In Cleo Harmony before 5.8.0.24, VLTrader before 5.8.0.24, and LexiCom before 5.8.0.24, an unauthenticated user can import and execute arbitrary Bash or PowerShell commands on the host system by leveraging the **default settings of the Autorun directory**.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **default settings of the Autorun directory**
- **impact:** import and execute arbitrary Bash or PowerShell commands
- **attacker:** unauthenticated user
- **product:** Cleo Harmony and VLTrader and LexiCom
- **version:** before 5.8.0.24

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
This document provides a detailed analysis of CVE-2024-55956, an actively exploited vulnerability in Cleo's LexiCom, VLTrader, and Harmony software.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is an arbitrary file-write vulnerability that allows a threat actor to write files to arbitrary locations on the file system. This is achieved by exploiting a flaw in the software's import functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:** The core weakness is the ability to write files to any location on the server's file system due to improper input validation of the file import process.
- **Insufficient Patching:** Although Cleo released a patch for CVE-2024-50623, this patch does not address the arbitrary file write vulnerability, leaving systems vulnerable.
- **Abuse of Autorun Feature:** Attackers exploit the autorun feature of Cleo software to achieve code execution by writing malicious files into the autorun directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can achieve remote code execution by exploiting the arbitrary file-write vulnerability and leveraging the autorun functionality.
- **Post-Exploitation Activity:** After gaining initial access, attackers engage in post-exploitation activities including:
    - Downloading and executing malicious JAR files for persistence.
    - Performing domain reconnaissance using tools like nltest.exe.
    - Enumerating and potentially compromising other systems on the network.
- **Data Breach:** The access gained could lead to sensitive data exposure and exfiltration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Exploitation:** Attackers exploit internet-exposed Cleo servers. The vulnerability can be triggered by sending specially crafted data to the vulnerable application.
- **Arbitrary File Write:** The vulnerability is triggered using the file import functionality, writing malicious files to the file system, specifically autorun directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable Cleo server.
- **Exploitation Skills:** The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious data to trigger the arbitrary file-write vulnerability.
- **Post-Exploitation Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge to perform post-exploitation activities and maintain persistence on the compromised system, which includes the knowledge of where to write files (autorun directory) and how to leverage the autorun functionality.

**Additional Details:**
- The analysis shows the attack chain, starting with writing a .txt file (`healthchecktemplate.txt`) in the autorun directory, importing a zip file which contains a main.xml file which defines additional actions, including the execution of a PowerShell command. The powershell command downloads JAR files from remote servers for persistence on the host.
- The threat actors are observed deleting the JAR files after execution to remain stealthy.
- The document provides specific IP addresses observed being used for callbacks by the threat actors.
- It includes mitigation steps such as disabling the autorun feature via configuration.
- It details detection methods implemented by Huntress to identify and neutralize this threat.
- It provides Sigma rules and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) for detection.
- Huntress successfully recreated the proof of concept and confirmed with Cleo that the previously released patch does not mitigate the vulnerability.
- The document provides a CyberChef recipe to decode the Powershell commands.
