  "description": "Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.2.3 on the `stable` branch and version 3.3.0.beta3 on the `tests-passed` branch, Oneboxing against a carefully crafted malicious URL can reduce the availability of a Discourse instance. The problem has been patched in version 3.2.3 on the `stable` branch and version 3.3.0.beta3 on the `tests-passed` branch. There are no known workarounds available for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content is related to CVE-2024-35227.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the use of `Object#send` in the `Onebox::Engine::StandardEmbed` class within the Discourse application. The `send` method allows calling any method on an object, including private or protected ones, which can be exploited when processing untrusted data.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Unrestricted method invocation: The use of `Object#send` allows an attacker to potentially call arbitrary methods on the `normalizer` object, which can lead to unexpected behavior or denial of service.\n- Code injection: While not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, the use of `send` can be a risk factor for code injection if the method names are derived from attacker-controlled input.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Denial of Service: By crafting a malicious URL that triggers the `Onebox` functionality, an attacker can cause a denial of service by overloading the server or causing it to perform an excessive number of operations.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Network: The attack can be performed remotely by sending a malicious URL to a Discourse instance.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- No privileges required: The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.\n- No user interaction: The attack does not require any user interaction. The attacker only needs to send a crafted URL to the Discourse instance.",

CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption, a class CWE. This parent-child relationship suggests that the allocation issue directly leads to resource consumption problems, making CWE-770 a more specific and accurate classification. We also considered CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop') and CWE-613 Insufficient Session Expiration as candidate causes.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe613[\"CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\"]\n    cwe835[\"CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n    class cwe613,cwe835 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a malicious URL, which triggers the Onebox functionality in Discourse. This leads to the **uncontrolled allocation of resources (CWE-770)**, eventually resulting in a denial-of-service due to **uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the provided text, particularly the root cause identified in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The vulnerability stems from the use of `Object#send` in the `Onebox::Engine::StandardEmbed` class within the Discourse application. The `send` method allows calling any method on an object, including private or protected ones, which can be exploited when processing untrusted data.\"\n\nThe evidence supports the selection of CWE-770 as the primary weakness, because the **unrestricted method invocation** can cause the application to allocate excessive resources without limits or throttling. The impact, a denial of service, aligns with the typical consequences of CWE-400, making it a suitable secondary classification to describe the outcome of the vulnerability.\n\nThe retriever results suggested several CWEs related to sensitive information exposure. However, these did not align well with the described denial-of-service vulnerability.\n\nThe final decision prioritizes CWE-770 for describing the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **uncontrolled resource allocation**. CWE-400 serves as a secondary classification, illustrating the impact of the vulnerability. These selections are made at the base and class level respectively, providing a balance between specificity and broader context.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
