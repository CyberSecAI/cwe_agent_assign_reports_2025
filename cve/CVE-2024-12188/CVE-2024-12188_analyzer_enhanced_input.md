## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability located in the `/brains/stu.php` file of the "Library Management System BCA 4th Semester Minor Project using SQL and PHP" project.
- The vulnerability occurs because the application directly uses the `useri` parameter from user input in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code through the `useri` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application fails to sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to manipulate SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized database access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive data leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Data tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.
- **Comprehensive system control:** Attackers could potentially gain control over the system.
- **Service interruption:** Attackers could cause a denial-of-service by disrupting the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to `/brains/stu.php`.
- **`useri` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected through the `useri` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can exploit the vulnerability remotely by sending a crafted POST request.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided content includes proof-of-concept (PoC) payloads for both error-based and time-based blind SQL injection.
- The content also provides a command example using sqlmap, a tool for automated SQL injection testing and exploitation.
- Suggested repairs include using prepared statements and parameter binding, input validation and filtering, minimizing database user permissions and regular security audits.
