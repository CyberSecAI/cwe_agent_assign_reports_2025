  "query": "jsPDF is a library to generate PDFs in JavaScript. Prior to 3.0.1, user control of the first argument of the addImage method results in CPU utilization and denial of service. If given the possibility to pass unsanitised image urls to the addImage method, a user can provide a harmful data-url that results in high CPU utilization and denial of service. Other affected methods are html and addSvgAsImage. The vulnerability was fixed in jsPDF 3.0.1.",
