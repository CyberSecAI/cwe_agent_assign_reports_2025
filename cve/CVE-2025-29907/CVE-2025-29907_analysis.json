The vulnerability occurs when the product uses a regular expression with an inefficient complexity, leading to excessive CPU cycles. |\n| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. The uncontrolled resource consumption leading to a denial of service. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-1333, which is a child of CWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity). CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) can be a consequence of CWE-1333, where inefficient regex leads to high CPU usage. The selection of CWE-1333 is more specific and at the Base level of abstraction, aligning with the vulnerability's root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1333[\"CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\"]\n    cwe407[\"CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe1333 -->|CHILDOF| cwe407\n    cwe1333 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1333 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n    class cwe407 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **user control of the first argument of the addImage method**, which leads to the use of an inefficient regular expression (CWE-1333). The inefficient regex causes high CPU utilization, resulting in uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) and ultimately a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the **user control** aspect and its impact. The CVE description and summary highlight that **user control of the first argument of the addImage method** allows for a harmful data-url to be passed, leading to high CPU utilization and denial of service. The retriever results pointed to CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity) as a strong candidate, which aligns with the root cause of high CPU utilization.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1333 as the primary CWE is based on the evidence that a harmful data-url triggers an inefficient regular expression, consuming excessive CPU cycles. CWE-400 is a secondary effect of this inefficiency. The relationships between these CWEs, particularly the parent-child relationship between CWE-1333 and CWE-407 and the potential chain leading to CWE-400, support this classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
