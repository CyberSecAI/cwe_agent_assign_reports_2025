## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved crypto aead,cipher - **zeroize key buffer after use** I.G 9.7.B for FIPS 140-3 specifies that variables temporarily holding cryptographic information should be zeroized once they are no longer needed. Accomplish this by using kfree_sensitive for buffers that previously held the private key.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **zeroize key buffer after use**
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** crypto aead,cipher

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the failure to properly zeroize key buffers after their use in the Linux kernel's crypto subsystem. Specifically, when setting keys for AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) and cipher algorithms, a temporary buffer is used to hold the key data. This buffer was being freed with `kfree` without clearing the key data first.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Information Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is a potential information leak. The key material remains in memory even after the key is no longer needed. This could allow an attacker with access to system memory to retrieve the cryptographic keys.
- **Violation of FIPS 140-3 I.G 9.7.B:** The fix addresses a requirement of FIPS 140-3, which mandates that variables holding cryptographic information should be zeroized when no longer needed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Compromised Encryption:** If an attacker gains access to the leaked key material, they can compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the data protected by that key. This means they could decrypt encrypted data, forge signatures, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Memory Access:** An attacker needs the ability to access the system's memory. This could be achieved via:
    - **Physical Access:** Direct access to the system's physical memory.
    - **Kernel Exploit:** Exploiting a different vulnerability to gain kernel-level read access to memory.
    - **Side-Channel Attacks:** In some scenarios, side-channel attacks (e.g., cold boot attacks) could potentially be used to access the memory contents after the `kfree` call, before the memory is overwritten.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Kernel-Level or Physical Access:** The attacker needs either the ability to read kernel memory, which requires either a kernel exploit or physical access to the system.
- **Timeliness:** The attacker needs to access memory soon after the key is used, before the memory location might be overwritten by other data.

**Fix:**
The fix replaces the `memset(alignbuffer, 0, keylen); kfree(buffer);` with `kfree_sensitive(buffer);` or `kzfree(buffer);`.

* `kfree_sensitive` ensures that the memory is zeroed before being freed.
* `kzfree` combines zeroing and freeing.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in the `crypto/aead.c` and `crypto/cipher.c` files.
- The fix has been backported to multiple stable kernel branches.
- Different patches used `kfree_sensitive` and `kzfree` as fix, seemingly different kernel version used different function.
