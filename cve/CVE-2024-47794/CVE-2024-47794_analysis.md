# Analysis for CVE-2024-47794

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-835 | Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability description explicitly states an **infinite loop** caused by a combination of tail calls and freplace. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of the vulnerability description to the definition of CWE-835. While other CWEs like CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion) were considered, the description explicitly indicates a looping condition rather than a recursive function call.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain consists of the following:
1.  The **root cause** is the combination of tail calls and freplace, leading to an **infinite loop** due to the tail_call_cnt resetting each time entry_freplace is executed.
2.  The **impact** of this **infinite loop** is a kernel panic.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the explicit description of an **infinite loop** within the provided text. The evidence clearly points to CWE-835 as the most appropriate classification.

The vulnerability description states: "There is a potential **infinite loop** issue that can occur when using a combination of tail calls and freplace... This results in an **infinite loop** entry_tc -> subprog_tc -> entry_freplace --tailcall-> entry_tc."

The provided evidence directly supports the selection of CWE-835. The description clearly defines the problem as an **infinite loop**.

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpf Prevent tailcall **infinite loop** caused by freplace There is a potential **infinite loop** issue that can occur when using a combination of tail calls and freplace. In an upcoming selftest, the attach target for entry_freplace of tailcall_freplace.c is subprog_tc of tc_bpf2bpf.c, while the tail call in entry_freplace leads to entry_tc. This results in an **infinite loop** entry_tc -> subprog_tc -> entry_freplace --tailcall-> entry_tc. The problem arises because the tail_call_cnt in entry_freplace resets to zero each time entry_freplace is executed, causing the tail call mechanism to never terminate, eventually leading to a kernel panic. To fix this issue, the solution is twofold 1. Prevent updating a program extended by an freplace program to a prog_array map. 2. Prevent extending a program that is already part of a prog_array map with an freplace program. This ensures that * If a program or its subprogram has been extended by an freplace program, it can no longer be updated to a prog_array map. * If a program has been added to a prog_array map, neither it nor its subprograms can be extended by an freplace program. Moreover, an extension program should not be tailcalled. As such, return -EINVAL if the program has a type of BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT when adding it to a prog_array map. Additionally, fix a minor code style issue by replacing eight spaces with a tab for proper formatting.
