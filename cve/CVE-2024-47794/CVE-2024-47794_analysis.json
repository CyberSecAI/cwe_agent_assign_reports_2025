  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpf Prevent tailcall **infinite loop** caused by freplace There is a potential **infinite loop** issue that can occur when using a combination of tail calls and freplace. In an upcoming selftest, the attach target for entry_freplace of tailcall_freplace.c is subprog_tc of tc_bpf2bpf.c, while the tail call in entry_freplace leads to entry_tc. This results in an **infinite loop** entry_tc -> subprog_tc -> entry_freplace --tailcall-> entry_tc. The problem arises because the tail_call_cnt in entry_freplace resets to zero each time entry_freplace is executed, causing the tail call mechanism to never terminate, eventually leading to a kernel panic. To fix this issue, the solution is twofold 1. Prevent updating a program extended by an freplace program to a prog_array map. 2. Prevent extending a program that is already part of a prog_array map with an freplace program. This ensures that * If a program or its subprogram has been extended by an freplace program, it can no longer be updated to a prog_array map. * If a program has been added to a prog_array map, neither it nor its subprograms can be extended by an freplace program. Moreover, an extension program should not be tailcalled. As such, return -EINVAL if the program has a type of BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT when adding it to a prog_array map. Additionally, fix a minor code style issue by replacing eight spaces with a tab for proper formatting.",
