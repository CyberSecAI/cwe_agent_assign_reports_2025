  "description": "The Page Restriction WordPress (WP) Protect WP Pages/Post plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Sensitive Information Exposure** in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.6 via the WordPress core search feature. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data from posts that have been restricted to higher-level roles such as administrator.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11297\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the WordPress core search functionality not being properly restricted by the \"Page and Post Restriction\" plugin. Despite content being restricted to specific user roles, the WordPress search feature can expose the content to unauthenticated users.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Inadequate Access Control:** The plugin fails to fully restrict access to content, specifically when accessed through the WordPress search feature.\n- **Sensitive Information Exposure:**  Restricted content (e.g., posts meant only for administrators) becomes accessible to unauthorized users.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** Unauthenticated attackers can extract sensitive data from posts that should have restricted access based on user roles. This could include confidential information intended for specific user roles.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **WordPress Core Search:** The primary attack vector involves exploiting the WordPress core search functionality. An attacker can use the search feature to retrieve content that should be restricted.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any specific privileges to exploit this vulnerability.\n- **Knowledge of Target Site:** The attacker needs to know the target WordPress website and utilize the search functionality to find restricted content.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n- The vulnerability affects all versions of the \"Page and Post Restriction\" plugin up to and including 1.3.6.\n- There is currently no known patch available.\n- The plugin developers have been notified about the vulnerability.",

While more specific base-level CWEs might exist under it, the provided information doesn't specify the exact mechanism of the missing authorization, making the class-level CWE the most appropriate. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information) is a consequence of the missing authorization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe200 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check, allowing unauthorized access, which then leads to the **exposure of sensitive information**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability based on the provided evidence. The vulnerability description clearly states that the plugin fails to restrict access to content through the WordPress search feature, leading to **sensitive information exposure**. This points towards an authorization issue.\n\nThe retriever results highlighted CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), CWE-425 (Direct Request), and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) as potential candidates. However, based on the vulnerability description and CVE summary, the core issue is that no authorization check is performed at all when accessing content via the search feature, rather than an incorrect authorization check. This solidifies the choice of CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) as the primary weakness. CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a consequence of the missing authorization. The evidence supports this: \"The plugin fails to fully restrict access to content, specifically when accessed through the WordPress search feature,\" and \"Restricted content (e.g., posts meant only for administrators) becomes accessible to unauthorized users.\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. While more granular CWEs might exist under CWE-862, the current evidence doesn't provide enough detail to pinpoint the exact authorization mechanism that is missing. Therefore, the class-level CWE is the most appropriate choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is not related to CSRF because the vulnerability is not about verifying the origin of a request.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* Although related to authorization, CWE-425 is more general.
