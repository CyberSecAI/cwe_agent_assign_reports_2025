The specific impact will vary depending on the actions available within the plugin and the user's privileges.\\n- **Attack vectors:** A successful CSRF attack can be launched if a logged-in user with higher privileges visits a malicious website.\\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a website containing malicious code that exploits the CSRF vulnerability.
