CWE-200 is a broader class that describes the exposure of sensitive information, and while relevant, it's less specific than CWE-538. The relationship is that CWE-538 can lead to CWE-200, but the root cause is the insertion of the data into the file. I did not find any other hierarchical relationships that impacted the decision.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe538[\"CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe538 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe538 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **faulty business logic** that leads to the inclusion of authenticated session data in the exported hub data source (CWE-538), which then results in the exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized actors (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several candidate CWEs, but CWE-538 best matches the vulnerability description because it specifically describes the insertion of sensitive information into an externally accessible file. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the **faulty business logic** causes the user's authenticated session to be included in the export. This aligns perfectly with CWE-538. While CWE-200 is a valid secondary consideration due to the ultimate exposure of sensitive information, it is a more general classification. The graph relationship analysis shows that CWE-538 can precede CWE-200, indicating that CWE-538 is the more direct cause of the vulnerability. I am overriding the retriever results favoring CWE-538 over CWE-532 as logs are not explicitly mentioned.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
