# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-23150

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ext4 fix **off-by-one error in do_split** Syzkaller detected a **use-after-free** issue in ext4_insert_dentry that was caused by out-of-bounds access due to incorrect splitting in do_split.
