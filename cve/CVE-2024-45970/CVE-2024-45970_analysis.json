This relates to the more general CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), of which both CWE-121 and CWE-120 are children. CWE-120 involves copying a buffer without checking its size, often leading to an out-of-bounds write, which can be a consequence of CWE-121.

The root cause is the **stack-based buffer overflow** (CWE-121), with the other CWEs contributing to the conditions that make the overflow possible.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis focuses on the provided vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions \"**multiple buffer overflows**\" and a \"**stack-based buffer overflow**\" triggered via the \"MMS FileDirResponse message\". This points directly to **CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow**. The description also mentions the overflows are caused by a malicious server, suggesting an external influence on the data being processed.\n\nThe retriever results strongly support **CWE-121** as the primary weakness, with high scores across multiple keyphrases (\"stack-based buffer overflow\", \"multiple buffer overflows\", \"MMS FileDirResponse message\", \"malicious server\", \"MZ Automation LibIEC61850\", \"before commit ac925fae8e281ac6defcd630e9dd756264e9c5bc\", \"MMS Client\").\n\nWhile **CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')** is also relevant, the explicit mention of \"stack-based\" makes **CWE-121** more specific and appropriate. **CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency** is considered as a contributing factor, as incorrect handling of length parameters could lead to the buffer overflow.\n\nThe final selection prioritizes the most specific CWE (**CWE-121**) while acknowledging related CWEs that describe the conditions or mechanisms involved in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- **CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow** is a direct match for the described vulnerability.\n- **CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')** is a related weakness that could contribute to the overflow, but it is less specific than CWE-121.\n- **CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency** could also contribute to the overflow by not properly validating the size of input, but is a step removed from the direct overflow.\n```",
