This leads to remote code execution, effectively giving the attacker control over the target system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states that the root cause is \"**deserialization of untrusted data**.\" This aligns directly with CWE-502, which describes the **weakness** as occurring when a product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring its validity.

In this case, mediDOK before 2.5.18.43 is vulnerable because it allows remote attackers to achieve remote code execution via **deserialization of untrusted data**. The **lack of proper validation** during deserialization allows the attacker to inject malicious code, leading to the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the target system.\n**Security Implications:**\nThe security implication is remote code execution. An attacker can gain complete control over the affected system.\n**Relationships:**\nCWE-502 is a base-level CWE.\n**Mapping Guidance:**\nThe official MITRE mapping guidance allows for the use of CWE-502 at the Base level of abstraction.

Such an alteration could lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\n\nInjection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities.\n",
