## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in binary-husky/gpt_academic version 310122f allows for a **Regular Expression Denial of Service** (ReDoS) attack. The application uses a regular expression to parse user input, which can take polynomial time to match certain crafted inputs. This allows an attacker to send a small malicious payload to the server, causing it to become unresponsive and unable to handle any requests from other users.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **Regular Expression Denial of Service**
- **impact:** Denial of Service
- **vector:** crafted inputs
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** binary-husky/gpt_academic
- **version:** version 310122f
