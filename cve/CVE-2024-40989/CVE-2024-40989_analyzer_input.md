# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-40989

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved KVM arm64 Disassociate vcpus from redistributor region on teardown When tearing down a redistributor region, make sure we dont have any **dangling pointer** to that region stored in a vcpu.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **dangling pointer**
- **impact:** Disassociate vcpus from redistributor region on teardown
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** KVM arm64

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is a dangling pointer within the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) implementation for ARM64 architecture. Specifically, when a redistributor region (related to the Virtual Generic Interrupt Controller, VGIC) is torn down, the code was not properly disassociating virtual CPUs (vcpus) from that region. This left vcpus with pointers to memory that could be freed, leading to use-after-free scenarios.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Dangling Pointers:** The primary weakness is the presence of dangling pointers. When a redistributor region is freed, vcpus might still hold pointers to the memory region, which are no longer valid.
- **Use-After-Free:** Consequently, accessing the freed redistributor region through these dangling pointers can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** Exploiting the vulnerability could result in memory corruption, as the hypervisor would attempt to use the freed memory.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Memory corruption can lead to system instability or a kernel crash, causing a denial of service.
- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the exact context and what data is being corrupted, a carefully crafted exploit could potentially lead to privilege escalation, though this is less certain and would require further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is within the KVM hypervisor's handling of virtual interrupt controllers on ARM64 architectures.
- An attacker would need to have the ability to create or manipulate virtual machines using KVM on an affected system.
- The attack would likely involve triggering the tear-down of a redistributor region after a vcpu has been associated with it, and then using the stale vcpu reference, which is a use-after-free

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create and control virtual machines using KVM on an affected ARM64 system.
- The attacker would need some level of understanding of KVM internals, particularly the VGIC implementation, to reliably trigger the vulnerability.

**Summary of the fix:**

The fix addresses the issue by:
- Modifying the `vgic_v3_free_redist_region` function to take a `kvm` parameter so it can iterate through all vcpus associated with the given KVM instance.
- Looping through each vcpu associated with the kvm to nullify the `rdreg` pointer if it refers to the region being freed before freeing the region.

The provided patches show the changes to `arch/arm64/kvm/vgic/vgic-init.c`, `arch/arm64/kvm/vgic/vgic-mmio-v3.c`, and `arch/arm64/kvm/vgic/vgic.h` to implement this fix.
