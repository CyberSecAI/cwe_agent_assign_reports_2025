  "description": "External Secrets Operator is a Kubernetes operator that integrates external secret management systems. The external-secrets has a deployment called default-external-secrets-cert-controller, which is bound with a same-name ClusterRole. This **ClusterRole has get/list verbs of secrets resources**. It also has path/update verb of validatingwebhookconfigurations resources. This can be used to abuse the SA token of the deployment to retrieve or get ALL secrets in the whole cluster, capture and log all data from requests attempting to update Secrets, or make a webhook deny all Pod create and update requests. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.10.2.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45041:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from overly permissive permissions granted to the `default-external-secrets-cert-controller` deployment in the `external-secrets` project. Specifically, the associated `ClusterRole` allows:\n\n1.  \"get/list\" access to all secrets resources across the cluster.\n2.  \"patch/update\" access to `validatingwebhookconfigurations` resources.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n*   **Excessive Permissions:** The core issue is the principle of least privilege violation, where the `cert-controller` has more permissions than necessary.\n*   **Secret Exposure:** The ability to \"get/list\" all secrets exposes sensitive information, potentially including cluster-admin credentials.\n*   **Webhook Manipulation:** The ability to \"patch/update\" `validatingwebhookconfigurations` allows for malicious manipulation of webhook behavior.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Cluster-Level Privilege Escalation:** By obtaining cluster-admin secrets, an attacker can gain full control of the Kubernetes cluster.\n*   **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker can intercept and log the contents of secrets through malicious webhooks updates, gaining access to sensitive data.\n*  **Denial of Service (DoS):** By modifying webhooks, an attacker can block the creation or update of pods, leading to a denial of service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Compromised Worker Node:** An attacker needs access to a worker node where the vulnerable `default-external-secrets-cert-controller` is running. This access enables them to leverage the pod's service account (SA) token.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Worker Node Access:** The attacker must gain access to a worker node within the Kubernetes cluster where the vulnerable pod is deployed.\n*   **Kubernetes Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have knowledge about Kubernetes RBAC, secrets, and webhooks to leverage these weaknesses.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n*   The provided content indicates a fix was implemented in version `v0.10.2`.\n*   The commit `428a452fd2ad45935312f2c2c0d40bc37ce6e67c` introduced `resourceNames` to limit the scope of webhook permissions, which is likely part of the fix for this vulnerability. The advisory also contains a link to the related commit which introduced the fix.\n\nThis information provides a much more detailed explanation than a basic CVE description.",

The key evidence is the **ClusterRole has get/list verbs of secrets resources**.\n\nCWE-267 (Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions) was chosen as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause: a privilege (the ClusterRole) is defined with actions that allow unintended and unsafe operations (retrieving all secrets). This aligns with the description: \"A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\"\n\nCWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) was considered but deemed too general. While the secrets are exposed to the wrong control sphere, CWE-267 captures the root cause more accurately. The mapping guidance for CWE-668 discourages its use as a catch-all.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was also considered, but the issue isn't an authorization check failing; it's the authorization policy itself being overly permissive.\n\nCWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) doesn't fit because the issue isn't a lack of authentication, but rather improperly defined authorization.\n\nThe selection of CWE-267 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it accurately represents the root cause of the vulnerability (unsafe privilege definition) and avoids being overly broad.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
