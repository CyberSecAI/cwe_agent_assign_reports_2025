  "description": "IrfanView RLE File Parsing Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of RLE files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a **memory corruption** condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24445.",

User interaction (opening a file or visiting a webpage) is required for exploitation.",

This is related to CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), as an out-of-bounds write violates memory buffer boundaries. The improper input validation can precede an out-of-bounds write (CWE-1284 -> CWE-787). Out-of-bounds write may lead to out-of-bounds read. The abstraction levels influenced the decision to choose CWE-787 as it is at the base level, and accurately describes the **memory corruption** caused by **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe125 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe787\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe125,cwe1284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-1284), which leads to a **memory corruption** condition by an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). This can potentially lead to an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125), ultimately enabling Remote Code Execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is due to a **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, leading to memory corruption via an out-of-bounds write.\n\nEvidence from the vulnerability description:\n*   \"The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a **memory corruption** condition.\"\n*   \"An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\"\n\nThe retriever results and similar CVE descriptions strongly suggest CWE-787 as the primary weakness.
