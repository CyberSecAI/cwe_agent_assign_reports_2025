# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-11519

## Vulnerability Description
IrfanView RLE File Parsing Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of RLE files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a **memory corruption** condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24445.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing RLE files within IrfanView, leading to a memory corruption condition.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory corruption due to insufficient input validation when parsing RLE files.
* **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the IrfanView process.
* **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a user opening a malicious RLE file or visiting a malicious webpage that triggers the vulnerability through a malicious RLE file.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to deliver a malicious RLE file to the victim, or entice a user to visit a malicious webpage that serves the malicious RLE file. User interaction (opening a file or visiting a webpage) is required for exploitation.
