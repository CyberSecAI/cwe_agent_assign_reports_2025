This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-200. The vulnerability allows a low-privileged attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. The retriever results also list CWE-200, though not as the top result. Given the direct match to the stated weakness, CWE-200 is chosen as the primary CWE.\n\nCWE-269 ([Improper Privilege Management](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/269.html)) is considered as a secondary CWE because the impact of the **information exposure** is privilege escalation. However, CWE-269 is discouraged for use as a primary CWE unless the root cause is directly related to privilege management issues. In this case, the root cause is **information exposure**, making CWE-200 a more appropriate primary classification.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-200 at the Class level, which accurately captures the nature of the **information exposure** vulnerability.",
