This leads to **path traversal**, which finally results in arbitrary file write outside the desired directory.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Improperly verifying symbolic link destinations**\n  - **Weakness:** CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n  - **Impact:** Arbitrary file write outside the desired directory\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a path traversal vulnerability in rsync when using the `--safe-links` option. The rsync client **fails to properly verify if a symbolic link destination sent from the server contains another symbolic link within it**, leading to arbitrary file writes outside the desired directory.\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-22, which accurately represents the **path traversal vulnerability** due to **improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory**. The vulnerability allows writing files outside the intended directory due to improper path validation. This aligns with the vulnerability description and the definition of CWE-22.\n\nCWE-59 is considered a secondary CWE because the **improper link resolution** is a contributing factor to the **path traversal**. The vulnerability involves symbolic links and their improper resolution, which allows attackers to traverse the file system.\n\nThe selection of CWE-22 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is appropriate for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities as recommended by MITRE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere.
