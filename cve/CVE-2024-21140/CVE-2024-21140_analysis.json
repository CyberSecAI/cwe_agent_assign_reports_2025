  "description": "Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM for JDK, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component Hotspot). Supported versions that are affected are Oracle Java SE 8u411, 8u411-perf, 11.0.23, 17.0.11, 21.0.3, 22.0.1 Oracle GraalVM for JDK 17.0.11, 21.0.3, 22.0.1 Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition 20.3.14 and 21.3.10. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM for JDK, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM for JDK, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM for JDK, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data. Note This vulnerability can be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the APIs. This vulnerability also applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security.

The specific nature of the flaw is not detailed, but it is related to how Hotspot handles certain operations.\n*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** This is a vulnerability related to the Java Hotspot component\n*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to achieve unauthorized access or modification of sensitive data, resulting in a medium risk rating. The confidentiality and integrity of data is impacted with low availability impact.\n*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not need any privileges to exploit this vulnerability but needs network access to a vulnerable system.\n\n**Summary of Information from NetApp Advisory:**\n*   NetApp confirms that multiple of their products utilize the vulnerable Java SE libraries.\n*   Specifically mentions Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere (version 9.14 only) and other products such as Data Infrastructure Insights Storage Workload Security Agent, NetApp BlueXP, OnCommand Insight, and OnCommand Workflow Automation as being affected.\n*   Lists the CVSS v3.1 score for CVE-2024-21140 as 4.8 (Medium) with the vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N.\n*   NetApp provides a list of affected and not-affected products, as well as remediation steps, software versions and fixes.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n*   Both documents do not go into specifics of the vulnerability. The Oracle document provides a high level overview while the NetApp document describes the affected versions and gives a high level description.\n*   The NetApp advisory provides some insight into the real-world impact of this vulnerability, showing it has impacted a number of products that integrate the vulnerable java libraries.",
