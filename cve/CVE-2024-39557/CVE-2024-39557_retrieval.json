  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-39557', description='An **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** vulnerability in the Layer 2 Address Learning Daemon (l2ald) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a **memory leak**, eventually exhausting all system memory, leading to a system crash and Denial of Service (DoS). Certain MAC table updates cause a small amount of memory to leak. Once memory utilization reaches its limit, the issue will result in a system crash and restart.

Certain MAC table updates cause a small amount of memory to leak. Once memory utilization reaches its limit, the issue will result in a system crash and restart.
