## Vulnerability Description
The WordPress Button Plugin MaxButtons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **information exposure** in all versions up to, and including, 9.7.8. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to obtain the full path to instances, which they may be able to use in combination with other vulnerabilities or to simplify reconnaissance work. On its own, this information is of very limited use.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **information exposure**
- **impact:** obtain full path to instances
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **product:** WordPress Button Plugin MaxButtons
- **version:** all versions up to and including 9.7.8

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6499:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the presence of a file, `convert.php`, within the MaxButtons plugin for WordPress that, when accessed directly, outputs the full server path. This occurs because the script is directly accessible and outputs data containing the server path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Full Path Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the full server path. This is due to the `convert.php` script not being properly protected and directly outputting data that includes the path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Exposure:** An attacker can obtain the full server path to the WordPress installation.
*   **Limited Direct Use:** The exposed path alone has very limited direct impact. However, this information can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to simplify attacks, especially in the reconnaissance phase.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Request:** An unauthenticated attacker can directly request the vulnerable `convert.php` file via HTTP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No authentication needed:** The attacker does not need any authentication.
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to make an HTTP request to the web server hosting the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Additional details:**

* The vulnerable file is located at `/assets/libraries/font-awesome-5/convert.php` within the MaxButtons plugin.
* The vulnerability was present in versions up to and including 9.7.8.
* The issue was fixed in version 9.8.0, where the file now has a check to prevent direct access.
