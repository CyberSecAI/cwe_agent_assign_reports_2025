This vulnerability exists because remote controller credentials are recorded in an internal log that is stored in the tech support file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing a tech support file that is generated from an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view remote controller admin credentials in clear text. Note Best practice is to store debug logs and tech support files safely and to share them only with trusted parties because they may contain sensitive information. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-321 CWE-306 CWE-284 CWE-778 CWE-256 CWE-522 CWE-497 CWE-532",
