This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.', key_phrases={'rootcause': ['insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query', 'insufficient escaping on user-supplied parameter'], 'weakness': 'SQL injection', 'impact': ['extract sensitive information from the database', 'extract sensitive information from database'], 'vector': '', 'attacker': 'unauthenticated attackers', 'product': 'Passwords Manager plugin for WordPress', 'version': 'all versions up to and including 1.4.8', 'component': 'several AJAX functions'}, reference_content='CVE-2024-12613: PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval\\n\\nThe provided content relates to a change in the `passwords-manager` WordPress plugin, specifically in the file `pms-passwords-ajax-action.php`. The changes include sanitization improvements and nonce verification to address potential security vulnerabilities.\\n\\nHere\\'s a breakdown of the relevant information:\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\n\\nThe code previously lacked sufficient sanitization of user inputs and proper nonce verification, potentially leading to vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and unauthorized data manipulation.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n\\n*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The original code had instances where user-provided data (e.g., `cat_name`, `search[\"value\"]`, `order[0][\\'dir\\']`) was not adequately sanitized before being used in database queries or outputted to the page.\\n*   **Missing/Inadequate Nonce Verification:**  The code lacked or had incomplete nonce verification for certain actions, making it susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n\\n*   **XSS:**  Without proper sanitization, malicious users could inject JavaScript code into the application, potentially stealing user cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or modifying the content of the page.\\n*   **CSRF:**  Without nonce verification, an attacker could trick a logged-in user into performing unintended actions on the website.\\n*   **Data Manipulation:** Lack of proper validation could allow attackers to modify or delete sensitive password data.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n\\n*   **Crafted HTTP Requests:** Attackers could send malicious HTTP requests with crafted payloads to exploit the lack of input sanitization.\\n*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Attackers could create malicious websites or emails that trick users into submitting requests to the vulnerable application.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n\\n*   **Unauthenticated/Low Privilege:** Some vulnerabilities (like XSS) could be exploited by unauthenticated users. Others (like data manipulation) might require a logged-in user with certain privileges.\\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress installation.\\n\\n**Mitigation or fix:**\\n\\nThe changeset implements the following mitigations:\\n\\n*   **Input Sanitization:**  The code now uses functions like `sanitize_text_field()`, `sanitize_email()`, `esc_url_raw()`, `absint()`, and `esc_html()` to sanitize user inputs before using them in database queries or outputting them to the page.\\n*   **Nonce Verification:** The code now includes nonce verification using `wp_verify_nonce()` to protect against CSRF attacks.\\n*   **Prepared Statements:** The code uses `$wpdb->prepare()` for database queries, which helps prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.\\n*   **Escaping Output:** The code uses escaping functions like `esc_attr()` and `esc_html()` to prevent XSS vulnerabilities when outputting data to the page.\\n\\nThe content provides more detail than the official CVE description would likely contain, as it shows the specific code changes made to address the vulnerabilities.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
