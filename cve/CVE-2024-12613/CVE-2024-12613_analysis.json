  "reference_content": "CVE-2024-12613: PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval\n\nThe provided content relates to a change in the `passwords-manager` WordPress plugin, specifically in the file `pms-passwords-ajax-action.php`. The changes include sanitization improvements and nonce verification to address potential security vulnerabilities.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe code previously lacked sufficient sanitization of user inputs and proper nonce verification, potentially leading to vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and unauthorized data manipulation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The original code had instances where user-provided data (e.g., `cat_name`, `search[\"value\"]`, `order[0]['dir']`) was not adequately sanitized before being used in database queries or outputted to the page.\n*   **Missing/Inadequate Nonce Verification:**  The code lacked or had incomplete nonce verification for certain actions, making it susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **XSS:**  Without proper sanitization, malicious users could inject JavaScript code into the application, potentially stealing user cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or modifying the content of the page.\n*   **CSRF:**  Without nonce verification, an attacker could trick a logged-in user into performing unintended actions on the website.\n*   **Data Manipulation:** Lack of proper validation could allow attackers to modify or delete sensitive password data.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Crafted HTTP Requests:** Attackers could send malicious HTTP requests with crafted payloads to exploit the lack of input sanitization.\n*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Attackers could create malicious websites or emails that trick users into submitting requests to the vulnerable application.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **Unauthenticated/Low Privilege:** Some vulnerabilities (like XSS) could be exploited by unauthenticated users. Others (like data manipulation) might require a logged-in user with certain privileges.\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress installation.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe changeset implements the following mitigations:\n\n*   **Input Sanitization:**  The code now uses functions like `sanitize_text_field()`, `sanitize_email()`, `esc_url_raw()`, `absint()`, and `esc_html()` to sanitize user inputs before using them in database queries or outputting them to the page.\n*   **Nonce Verification:** The code now includes nonce verification using `wp_verify_nonce()` to protect against CSRF attacks.\n*   **Prepared Statements:** The code uses `$wpdb->prepare()` for database queries, which helps prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n*   **Escaping Output:** The code uses escaping functions like `esc_attr()` and `esc_html()` to prevent XSS vulnerabilities when outputting data to the page.\n\nThe content provides more detail than the official CVE description would likely contain, as it shows the specific code changes made to address the vulnerabilities.",

CWE-89 is a base CWE and a child of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) and CWE-943 (Improper Neutralization Across a Trust Boundary). CWE-116 could be considered a contributing factor, as it describes a general lack of proper encoding or escaping, but CWE-89 is a more specific and accurate representation of the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe943[\"CWE-943: Improper Neutralization Across a Trust Boundary\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe943\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe116 secondary\n    class cwe74,cwe943 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query** in the Passwords Manager plugin. This leads to CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')), which allows unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands. The final impact is the ability to extract sensitive information from the database.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')), as the vulnerability description clearly indicates that the root cause is the **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query** which leads to SQL injection. The description states, \"This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.\" This aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-89.\n\nCWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output) was considered as a secondary weakness, as **insufficient escaping** can be seen as a form of improper encoding or escaping. However, since the injection specifically targets SQL commands, CWE-89 is the more precise and appropriate classification.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **root cause** of the SQL injection vulnerability. Other CWEs, such as CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')), are more general and less descriptive of the specific vulnerability.\n\nThe evidence provided in the vulnerability description, including the **root cause** \"insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query\" and the resulting \"SQL injection\" vulnerability, strongly supports the classification of CWE-89 as the primary weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* There is no mention of authentication algorithms in the description.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* There is no indication of missing authorization checks on URLs or files in the description.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* The vulnerability description does not mention the use of assumed-immutable web parameters.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*Not Used:* While CWE-74 is a parent of CWE-89, CWE-89 is a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Used:* This is too general.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Used:* Although the vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers, the **root cause** is not weak authentication.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Used:* There is no mention of weak credentials in the description.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* The vulnerability is about SQL injection, not cleartext transmission of data.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0",
