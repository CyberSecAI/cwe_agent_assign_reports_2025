  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-2831 Content\n\nBased on the provided content, this relates to a SQL injection vulnerability.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe code uses string concatenation to build the SQL query, incorporating user-supplied input (`where.get(\"condition\")` and `where.get(\"conditionValue\")`) directly into the query without proper sanitization or parameterization. While `PreparedStatement` is used, it's not utilized correctly to prevent SQL injection. The parameters are not bound as placeholders, leading to the vulnerability.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n*   Improper input validation\n*   Incorrect use of `PreparedStatement`\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAn attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `condition` and `conditionValue` parameters, potentially allowing them to:\n\n*   Bypass authentication\n*   Read sensitive data from the database\n*   Modify or delete data\n*   Execute arbitrary commands on the database server (depending on database permissions)\n\nThe provided content demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection payload (`SELECT 5645 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))xoUI`) that causes a 5-second delay, confirming the vulnerability.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nThe vulnerability is exploitable through the following URLs:\n\n*   `https://library.mingyuefusu.top/admin/bookList?page=1&limit=10&condition=name%20AND%20(SELECT%205645%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))xoUI)&conditionValue=Java`\n*   `https://library.mingyuefusu.top/admin//borrowList?limit=1&page=1&condition=1%20AND%20(SELECT%205645%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))xoUI)&conditionValue=1`\n*   `https://library.mingyuefusu.top/reader/book?limit=1&page=1&condition=1%20AND%20(SELECT%205645%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))xoUI)&conditionValue=1`\n*   `https://library.mingyuefusu.top/reader/borrow?limit=1&page=1&condition=1%20AND%20(SELECT%205645%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))xoUI)&conditionValue=1`\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable URLs.\n*   No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Use parameterized queries (Prepared Statements) correctly:**  Instead of concatenating strings, use placeholders in the SQL query and bind the user-supplied values to these placeholders using the `PreparedStatement`'s `setXXX()` methods (e.g., `pstmt.setString(1, where.get(\"condition\"))`).\n*   **Input validation:** Validate and sanitize all user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.\n*   **Least privilege:** Ensure the database user used by the application has only the necessary permissions.\n\n**More detail than official CVE description:**\n\nYes, the content provides a detailed analysis of the vulnerability, including the vulnerable code snippet, specific attack vectors, and a demonstration of exploitation using a time-based blind SQL injection payload. This level of detail is not typically found in a standard CVE description.",
