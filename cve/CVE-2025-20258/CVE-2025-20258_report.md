# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-20258

## Description

A vulnerability in the self-service portal of Cisco Duo could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary commands into emails that are sent by the service. This vulnerability is due to **insufficient input validation**. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary commands into a portion of an email that is sent by the service. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send emails that contain malicious content to unsuspecting users.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** insufficient input validation
- **Product:** Cisco Duo self-service portal
- **Impact:** inject arbitrary commands, send emails with malicious content
- **Attacker:** unauthenticated remote attacker

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-93 | Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection') | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-113 | Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting') | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-93 Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')**. This is due to the **insufficient input validation** allowing the injection of arbitrary commands into emails, which leverages CRLF sequences to manipulate email headers. **CWE-113 Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting')** is a related variant, but less applicable as this involves email injection, not necessarily HTTP headers directly. **CWE-20 Improper Input Validation** is a high-level class and less specific than CWE-93 which describes how the input validation is improper, by not neutralizing CRLF sequences.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-20 Improper Input Validation**, leading to **CWE-93 Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')**. The attacker exploits this by injecting arbitrary commands into emails, resulting in the ability to send malicious content to unsuspecting users.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary assessment is based on the vulnerability description indicating **insufficient input validation** that allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into emails. This aligns strongly with **CWE-93 Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')**, as CRLF injection is a common technique for manipulating email headers and content when input validation is lacking. The evidence provided directly supports this classification. **CWE-113 Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting')** was considered but is less relevant since the vulnerability involves email injection rather than specifically HTTP header manipulation. **CWE-20 Improper Input Validation** is too generic, while CWE-93 specifies the exact nature of the input validation issue. The chain of weaknesses clearly shows the progression from insufficient input validation to CRLF injection, enabling the attacker to send malicious emails.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.



## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base

**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
