Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-30275: Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1126: A vulnerability in the storage of proxy server credentials of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view credentials for a configured proxy server. The vulnerability is due to clear-text storage and weak permissions of related configuration files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the CLI of the affected software and viewing the contents of the affected files. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view the credentials that are used to access the proxy server.\n\n- CVE-2021-41023: A unprotected storage of credentials in Fortinet FortiSIEM Windows Agent version 4.1.4 and below allows an authenticated user to disclosure agent password due to plaintext credential storage in log files\n\n- CVE-2021-1589: A vulnerability in the disaster recovery feature of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to user credentials. This vulnerability exists because access to API endpoints is not properly restricted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a request to an API endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to administrative credentials that could be used in further attacks.\n\n- CVE-2021-41297: ECOA BAS controller is vulnerable to weak access control mechanism allowing authenticated user to remotely escalate privileges by disclosing credentials of administrative accounts in plain-text.\n\n- CVE-2021-21590: Dell EMC Unity, Unity XT, and UnityVSA versions prior to 5.1.0.0.5.394 contain a plain-text password storage vulnerability. A local malicious user with high privileges may use the exposed password to gain access with the privileges of the compromised user.\n\n- CVE-2021-21591: Dell EMC Unity, Unity XT, and UnityVSA versions prior to 5.1.0.0.5.394 contain a plain-text password storage vulnerability.

When the `reset a forgotten password` feature of XWiki was used, the password was then stored in plain text in database. This only concerns XWiki 13.1RC1 and newer versions. Note that it only concerns the reset password feature available from the \"Forgot your password\" link in the login view: the features allowing a user to change their password, or for an admin to change a user password are not impacted. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous in combination with other vulnerabilities allowing to perform data leak of personal data from users, such as GHSA-599v-w48h-rjrm. Note that this vulnerability only concerns the users of the main wiki: in case of farms, the users registered on subwiki are not impacted thanks to a bug we discovered when investigating this. The problem has been patched in version 14.6RC1, 14.4.3 and 13.10.8. The patch involves a migration of the impacted users as well as the history of the page, to ensure no password remains in plain text in the database. This migration also involves to inform the users about the possible disclosure of their passwords: by default, two emails are automatically sent to the impacted users. A first email to inform about the possibility that their password have been leaked, and a second email using the reset password feature to ask them to set a new password. It's also possible for administrators to set some properties for the migration: it's possible to decide if the user password should be reset (default) or if the passwords should be kept but only hashed. Note that in the first option, the users won't be able to login anymore until they set a new password if they were impacted. Note that in both options, mails will be sent to users to inform them and encourage them to change their passwords.\n\n- CVE-2022-4312:  A cleartext storage of sensitive information vulnerability exists in PcVue versions 8.10 through 15.2.3.

Restricting frontend login to specific users, organized in different storage folders (partitions), can be bypassed. A potential attacker might use this ambiguity in usernames to get access to a different account - however, credentials must be known to the adversary. This issue is patched in versions 8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23600: fleet is an open source device management, built on osquery. Versions prior to 4.9.1 expose a limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with missing audience verification. This impacts deployments using SAML SSO in two specific cases: 1. A malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) could reuse the SAML response to log into Fleet as a user -- only if the user has an account with the same email in Fleet, _and_ the user signs into the malicious SP via SAML SSO from the same Identity Provider (IdP) configured with Fleet. 2. A user with an account in Fleet could reuse a SAML response intended for another SP to log into Fleet. This is only a concern if the user is blocked from Fleet in the IdP, but continues to have an account in Fleet. If the user is blocked from the IdP entirely, this cannot be exploited. Fleet 4.9.1 resolves this issue. Users unable to upgrade should: Reduce the length of sessions on your IdP to reduce the window for malicious re-use, Limit the amount of SAML Service Providers/Applications used by user accounts with access to Fleet, and When removing access to Fleet in the IdP, delete the Fleet user from Fleet as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24259: An incorrect check in the component cdr.php of Voipmonitor GUI before v24.96 allows unauthenticated attackers to escalate privileges via a crafted request.\n\n- CVE-2022-24883: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Prior to version 2.7.0, server side authentication against a `SAM` file might be successful for invalid credentials if the server has configured an invalid `SAM` file path. FreeRDP based clients are not affected. RDP server implementations using FreeRDP to authenticate against a `SAM` file are affected. Version 2.7.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, use custom authentication via `HashCallback` and/or ensure the `SAM` database path configured is valid and the application has file handles left.\n\n- CVE-2022-24885: Nextcloud Android app is the Android client for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to version 3.19.1, users can bypass a lock on the Nextcloud app on an Android device by repeatedly reopening the app. Version 3.19.1 contains a fix for the problem. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24976: Atheme IRC Services before 7.2.12, when used in conjunction with InspIRCd, allows authentication bypass by ending an IRC handshake at a certain point during a challenge-response login sequence.\n\n- CVE-2022-2533: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 12.10 before 15.1.6, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.4, all versions starting from 15.3 before 15.3.2.

There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36412: In Zoho ManageEngine SupportCenter Plus before 11023, V3 API requests are vulnerable to authentication bypass. (An API request may, in effect, be executed with the credentials of a user who authenticated in the past.)\n\n- CVE-2022-39238: Arvados is an open source platform for managing and analyzing biomedical big data. In versions prior to 2.4.3, when using Portable Authentication Modules (PAM) for user authentication, if a user presented valid credentials but the account is disabled or otherwise not allowed to access the host (such as an expired password), it would still be accepted for access to Arvados. Other authentication methods (LDAP, OpenID Connect) supported by Arvados are not affected by this flaw. This issue is patched in version 2.4.3. Workaround for this issue is to migrate to a different authentication method supported by Arvados, such as LDAP.\n\n- CVE-2022-39263: `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available.

Versions prior to 2.7.13 in `stable`, 2.8.0.beta11 in `beta`, and 2.8.0.beta11 in `tests-passed` allow some users to log in to a community before they should be able to do so. A user invited via email to a forum with `must_approve_users` enabled is going to be automatically logged in, bypassing the check that does not allow unapproved users to sign in. They will be able to do everything an approved user can do. If they logout, they cannot log back in. This issue is patched in the `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11. One may disable invites as a workaround. Administrators can increase `min_trust_level_to_allow_invite` to reduce the attack surface to more trusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-2303: An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1.

Due to a bug in ASF code `POST /Api/ASF` ASF API endpoint responsible for updating global ASF config incorrectly removed `IPCPassword` from the resulting config when the caller did not specify it explicitly. Due to the above, it was possible for the user to accidentally remove `IPCPassword` security measure from his IPC interface when updating global ASF config, which exists as part of global config update functionality in ASF-ui. Removal of `IPCPassword` possesses a security risk, as unauthorized users may in result access the IPC interface after such modification. The issue is patched in ASF V5.1.2.4 and future versions. We recommend to manually verify that `IPCPassword` is specified after update, and if not, set it accordingly. In default settings, ASF is configured to allow IPC access from `localhost` only and should not affect majority of users.\n\n- CVE-2021-3282: HashiCorp Vault Enterprise 1.6.0 & 1.6.1 allowed the `remove-peer` raft operator command to be executed against DR secondaries without authentication. Fixed in 1.6.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-34675: Basix NEX-Forms through 7.8.7 allows authentication bypass for stored PDF reports.\n\n- CVE-2021-34676: Basix NEX-Forms through 7.8.7 allows authentication bypass for Excel report generation.\n\n- CVE-2021-35941: Western Digital WD My Book Live (2.x and later) and WD My Book Live Duo (all versions) have an administrator API that can perform a system factory restore without authentication, as exploited in the wild in June 2021, a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-18472.\n\n- CVE-2021-37415: Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus before 11302 is vulnerable to authentication bypass that allows a few REST-API URLs without authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-37420: Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus before 6112 is vulnerable to mail spoofing.\n\n- CVE-2021-37624: FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. Prior to version 1.10.7, FreeSWITCH does not authenticate SIP MESSAGE requests, leading to spam and message spoofing. By default, SIP requests of the type MESSAGE (RFC 3428) are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. MESSAGE requests are relayed to SIP user agents registered with the FreeSWITCH server without requiring any authentication. Although this behaviour can be changed by setting the `auth-messages` parameter to `true`, it is not the default setting. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to send SIP MESSAGE messages to any SIP user agent that is registered with the server without requiring authentication. Additionally, since no authentication is required, chat messages can be spoofed to appear to come from trusted entities. Therefore, abuse can lead to spam and enable social engineering, phishing and similar attacks. This issue is patched in version 1.10.7. Maintainers recommend that this SIP message type is authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to be explicitly set the `auth-messages` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-38412: Properly formatted POST requests to multiple resources on the HTTP and HTTPS web servers of the Digi PortServer TS 16 Rack device do not require authentication or authentication tokens. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to enable the SNMP service and manipulate the community strings to achieve further control in.\n\n- CVE-2021-41157: FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. By default, SIP requests of the type SUBSCRIBE are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to subscribe to user agent event notifications without the need to authenticate. This abuse poses privacy concerns and might lead to social engineering or similar attacks. For example, attackers may be able to monitor the status of target SIP extensions. Although this issue was fixed in version v1.10.6, installations upgraded to the fixed version of FreeSWITCH from an older version, may still be vulnerable if the configuration is not updated accordingly. Software upgrades do not update the configuration by default. SIP SUBSCRIBE messages should be authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to explicitly set the `auth-subscriptions` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2020-25566: In SapphireIMS 5.0, it is possible to take over an account by sending a request to the Save_Password form as shown in POC. Notice that we do not require a JSESSIONID in this request and can reset any user\u2019s password by changing the username to that user and password to base64(desired password).\n\n- CVE-2021-30167: The manage users profile services of the network camera device allows an authenticated.

Remote attackers can use the vulnerability to view and modify arbitrary content of books without permission.\n\n- CVE-2020-17517: The S3 buckets and keys in a secure Apache Ozone Cluster must be inaccessible to anonymous access by default. The current security vulnerability allows access to keys and buckets through a curl command or an unauthenticated HTTP request. This enables unauthorized access to buckets and keys thereby exposing data to anonymous clients or users. This affected Apache Ozone prior to the 1.1.0 release.\n\n- CVE-2020-4669: IBM Planning Analytics Local 2.0 connects to a MongoDB server. MongoDB, a document-oriented database system, is listening on the remote port, and it is configured to allow connections without password authentication. A remote attacker can gain unauthorized access to the database. IBM X-Force ID: 184600.\n\n- CVE-2021-33924: Confluent Ansible (cp-ansible) version 5.5.0, 5.5.1, 5.5.2 and 6.0.0 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control via its auxiliary component that allows remote attackers to access sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-35936: If remote logging is not used, the worker (in the case of CeleryExecutor) or the scheduler (in the case of LocalExecutor) runs a Flask logging server and is listening on a specific port and also binds on 0.0.0.0 by default.

The first is on Baremetal, OpenStack, Ovirt, Vsphere and KubeVirt deployments which do not have a separate internal API endpoint and allow access from outside the cluster to port 22623 from the standard OpenShift API Virtual IP address. The second is on cloud deployments when using unsupported network plugins, which do not create iptables rules that prevent to port 22623. In this scenario, the ignition config is exposed to all pods within the cluster and cannot be accessed externally.\n\n- CVE-2021-26637: There is no account authentication and permission check logic in the firmware and existing apps of SiHAS's SGW-300, ACM-300, GCM-300, so unauthorized users can remotely control the device.\n\n- CVE-2022-44013: An issue was discovered in Simmeth Lieferantenmanager before 5.6.

A malicious user can modify the contents of a `confirmation_token` input during the two-factor authentication process to reference a cache value not associated with the login attempt. In rare cases this can allow a malicious actor to authenticate as a random user in the Panel. The malicious user must target an account with two-factor authentication enabled, and then must provide a correct two-factor authentication token before being authenticated as that user. Due to a validation flaw in the logic handling user authentication during the two-factor authentication process a malicious user can trick the system into loading credentials for an arbitrary user by modifying the token sent to the server. This authentication flaw is present in the `LoginCheckpointController@__invoke` method which handles two-factor authentication for a user. This controller looks for a request input parameter called `confirmation_token` which is expected to be a 64 character random alpha-numeric string that references a value within the Panel's cache containing a `user_id` value. This value is then used to fetch the user that attempted to login, and lookup their two-factor authentication token. Due to the design of this system, any element in the cache that contains only digits could be referenced by a malicious user, and whatever value is stored at that position would be used as the `user_id`. There are a few different areas of the Panel that store values into the cache that are integers, and a user who determines what those cache keys are could pass one of those keys which would cause this code pathway to reference an arbitrary user. At its heart this is a high-risk login bypass vulnerability. However, there are a few additional conditions that must be met in order for this to be successfully executed, notably: 1.) The account referenced by the malicious cache key must have two-factor authentication enabled. An account without two-factor authentication would cause an exception to be triggered by the authentication logic, thusly exiting this authentication flow. 2.) Even if the malicious user is able to reference a valid cache key that references a valid user account with two-factor authentication, they must provide a valid two-factor authentication token. However, due to the design of this endpoint once a valid user account is found with two-factor authentication enabled there is no rate-limiting present, thusly allowing an attacker to brute force combinations until successful. This leads to a third condition that must be met: 3.) For the duration of this attack sequence the cache key being referenced must continue to exist with a valid `user_id` value. Depending on the specific key being used for this attack, this value may disappear quickly, or be changed by other random user interactions on the Panel, outside the control of the attacker. In order to mitigate this vulnerability the underlying authentication logic was changed to use an encrypted session store that the user is therefore unable to control the value of. This completely removed the use of a user-controlled value being used. In addition, the code was audited to ensure this type of vulnerability is not present elsewhere.\n\n- CVE-2021-42338: 4MOSAn GCB Doctor\u2019s login page has improper validation of Cookie, which allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass authentication by code injection in cookie, and arbitrarily manipulate the system or interrupt services by upload and execution of arbitrary files.\n\n- CVE-2021-1541: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an attacker to do the following: Hijack a user session Execute arbitrary commands as a root user on the underlying operating system Conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack Conduct an HTML injection attack For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-41317: XSS Hunter Express before 2021-09-17 does not properly enforce authentication requirements for paths.\n\n- CVE-2021-29012: DMA Softlab Radius Manager 4.4.0 assigns the same session cookie to every admin session.

In Envoy version 1.17.0 an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list when Envoy's JWT Authentication filter is configured with the `allow_missing` requirement under `requires_any` due to a mistake in implementation. Envoy's JWT Authentication filter can be configured with the `allow_missing` requirement that will be satisfied if JWT is missing (JwtMissed error) and fail if JWT is presented or invalid. Due to a mistake in implementation, a JwtUnknownIssuer error was mistakenly converted to JwtMissed when `requires_any` was configured. So if `allow_missing` was configured under `requires_any`, an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list. Integrity may be impacted depending on configuration if the JWT token is used to protect against writes or modifications. This regression was introduced on 2020/11/12 in PR 13839 which fixed handling `allow_missing` under RequiresAny in a JwtRequirement (see issue 13458). The AnyVerifier aggregates the children verifiers' results into a final status where JwtMissing is the default error. However, a JwtUnknownIssuer was mistakenly treated the same as a JwtMissing error and the resulting final aggregation was the default JwtMissing. As a result, `allow_missing` would allow a JWT token with an unknown issuer status. This is fixed in version 1.17.1 by PR 15194. The fix works by preferring JwtUnknownIssuer over a JwtMissing error, fixing the accidental conversion and bypass with `allow_missing`. A user could detect whether a bypass occurred if they have Envoy logs enabled with debug verbosity. Users can enable component level debug logs for JWT. The JWT filter logs will indicate that there is a request with a JWT token and a failure that the JWT token is missing.\n\n- CVE-2021-21513: Dell EMC OpenManage Server Administrator (OMSA) version 9.5 Microsoft Windows installations with Distributed Web Server (DWS) enabled configuration contains an authentication bypass vulnerability.

This is a follow up to GHSA-887w-pv2r-x8pm/CVE-2021-41276, the initial fix was incomplete. Tuleap does not sanitize properly the search filter built from the ldap_id attribute of a user during the daily synchronization. A malicious user could force accounts to be suspended or take over another account by forcing the update of the ldap_uid attribute. Note that the malicious user either need to have site administrator capability on the Tuleap instance or be an LDAP operator with the capability to create/modify account. The Tuleap instance needs to have the LDAP plugin activated and enabled for this issue to be exploitable. The following versions contain the fix: Tuleap Community Edition 13.2.99.83, Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.1-6, and Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.2-4.\n\n- CVE-2021-39031: IBM WebSphere Application Server - Liberty 17.0.0.3 through 22.0.0.1 could allow a remote authenticated attacker to conduct an LDAP injection.

IBM X-Force ID: 213875.\n\n- CVE-2022-22360: IBM Sterling Partner Engagement Manager 6.1.2, 6.2, and Cloud/SasS 22.2 could allow a remote authenticated attacker to conduct an LDAP injection. By using a specially crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability and could result in in granting permission to unauthorized resources. IBM X-Force ID: 220782.\n\n- CVE-2022-45910: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an LDAP query ('LDAP Injection') vulnerability in ActiveDirectory and Sharepoint ActiveDirectory authority connectors of Apache ManifoldCF allows an attacker to manipulate the LDAP search queries (DoS, additional queries, filter manipulation) during user lookup, if the username or the domain string are passed to the UserACLs servlet without validation. This issue affects Apache ManifoldCF version 2.23 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-24832: GoCD is an open source a continuous delivery server. The bundled gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin included with the GoCD Server fails to correctly escape special characters when using the username to construct LDAP queries. While this does not directly allow arbitrary LDAP data exfiltration, it can allow an existing LDAP-authenticated GoCD user with malicious intent to construct and execute malicious queries, allowing them to deduce facts about other users or entries within the LDAP database (e.g alternate fields, usernames, hashed passwords etc) through brute force mechanisms. This only affects users who have a working LDAP authorization configuration enabled on their GoCD server, and only is exploitable by users authenticating using such an LDAP configuration. This issue has been fixed in GoCD 22.1.0, which is bundled with gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin v2.2.0-144.\n\n- CVE-2022-22975: An issue was discovered in the Pinniped Supervisor with either LADPIdentityProvider or ActiveDirectoryIdentityProvider resources. An attack would involve the malicious user changing the common name (CN) of their user entry on the LDAP or AD server to include special characters, which could be used to perform LDAP query injection on the Supervisor's LDAP query which determines their Kubernetes group membership.\n\n- CVE-2022-31088: LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups, DHCP settings) stored in an LDAP directory. In versions prior to 8.0 the user name field at login could be used to enumerate LDAP data. This is only the case for LDAP search configuration. This issue has been fixed in version 8.0.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-943 (ChildOf)",

It mishandles software updates such that local third-party apps can provide a spoofed software update file that contains an arbitrary shell script and arbitrary ARM binary, where both will be executed as the root user with an SELinux domain named osi. To exploit this vulnerability, a local third-party app needs to have write access to external storage to write the spoofed update at the expected path. The vulnerable system binary (i.e., /system/bin/osi_bin) does not perform any authentication of the update file beyond ensuring that it is encrypted with an AES key (that is hard-coded in the vulnerable system binary). Processes executing with the osi SELinux domain can programmatically perform the following actions: install apps, grant runtime permissions to apps (including permissions with protection levels of dangerous and development), access extensive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) using the programmatically grant permissions, uninstall apps, set the default launcher app to a malicious launcher app that spoofs other apps, set a network proxy to intercept network traffic, unload kernel modules, set the default keyboard to a keyboard that has keylogging functionality, examine notification contents, send text messages, and more. The spoofed update can optionally contain an arbitrary ARM binary that will be locally stored in internal storage and executed at system startup to achieve persistent code execution as the root user with the osi SELinux domain. This ARM binary will continue to execute at startup even if the app that provided the spoofed update is uninstalled.\n\n- CVE-2020-7352: The GalaxyClientService component of GOG Galaxy runs with elevated SYSTEM privileges in a Windows environment. Due to the software shipping with embedded, static RSA private key, an attacker with this key material and local user permissions can effectively send any operating system command to the service for execution in this elevated context.

The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker. Some kinds of sensitive information include:\n\n\n  - private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details\n\n  - system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages\n\n  - business secrets and intellectual property\n\n  - network status and configuration\n\n  - the product's own code or internal state\n\n  - metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers\n\n  - indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider\n\nInformation might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected. These parties include:\n\n  - the product's own users\n\n  - people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users\n\n  - the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates\n\n  - the developer\n\nInformation exposures can occur in different ways:\n\n  - the code  **explicitly inserts**  sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been \"scrubbed\" or \"sanitized\"\n\n  - a different weakness or mistake  **indirectly inserts**  the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.\n\n  - the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are  **unintentionally made accessible**  to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.\n\nIt is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read. CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store, transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-31162: Rust library leaks Oauth client details in application debug logs\n\n- CVE-2021-25476: Digital Rights Management (DRM) capability for mobile platform leaks pointer information, simplifying ASLR bypass\n\n- CVE-2001-1483: Enumeration of valid usernames based on inconsistent responses\n\n- CVE-2001-1528: Account number enumeration via inconsistent responses.\n\n- CVE-2004-2150: User enumeration via discrepancies in error messages.\n\n- CVE-2005-1205: Telnet protocol allows servers to obtain sensitive environment information from clients.\n\n- CVE-2002-1725: Script calls phpinfo(), revealing system configuration to web user\n\n- CVE-2002-0515: Product sets a different TTL when a port is being filtered than when it is not being filtered, which allows remote attackers to identify filtered ports by comparing TTLs.\n\n- CVE-2004-0778: Version control system allows remote attackers to determine the existence of arbitrary files and directories via the -X command for an alternate history file, which causes different error messages to be returned.\n\n- CVE-2000-1117: Virtual machine allows malicious web site operators to determine the existence of files on the client by measuring delays in the execution of the getSystemResource method.\n\n- CVE-2003-0190: Product immediately sends an error message when a user does not exist, which allows remote attackers to determine valid usernames via a timing attack.\n\n- CVE-2008-2049: POP3 server reveals a password in an error message after multiple APOP commands are sent.

In affected versions users who use [`HttpAuthMiddleware`](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth) (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for Splash authentication will have any non-Splash request expose your credentials to the request target. This includes `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`. Upgrade to scrapy-splash 0.8.0 and use the new `SPLASH_USER` and `SPLASH_PASS` settings instead to set your Splash authentication credentials safely. If you cannot upgrade, set your Splash request credentials on a per-request basis, [using the `splash_headers` request parameter](https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash/tree/0.8.x#http-basic-auth), instead of defining them globally using the [`HttpAuthMiddleware`](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth). Alternatively, make sure all your requests go through Splash. That includes disabling the [robots.txt middleware](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#topics-dlmw-robots).\n\n- CVE-2021-32720: Sylius is an Open Source eCommerce platform on top of Symfony. In versions of Sylius prior to 1.9.5 and 1.10.0-RC.1, part of the details (order ID, order number, items total, and token value) of all placed orders were exposed to unauthorized users. If exploited properly, a few additional information like the number of items in the cart and the date of the shipping may be fetched as well. This data seems to not be crucial nor is personal data, however, could be used for sociotechnical attacks or may expose a few details about shop condition to the third parties. The data possible to aggregate are the number of processed orders or their value in the moment of time. The problem has been patched at Sylius 1.9.5 and 1.10.0-RC.1. There are a few workarounds for the vulnerability. The first possible solution is to hide the problematic endpoints behind the firewall from not logged in users. This would put only the order list under the firewall and allow only authorized users to access it. Once a user is authorized, it will have access to theirs orders only. The second possible solution is to decorate the `\\\\Sylius\\\\Bundle\\\\ApiBundle\\\\Doctrine\\\\QueryCollectionExtension\\\\OrdersByLoggedInUserExtension` and throw `Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Security\\\\Core\\\\Exception\\\\AccessDeniedException` if the class is executed for unauthorized user.\n\n- CVE-2021-39192: Ghost is a Node.js content management system.

To see the response packets, the attacker has to sniff the traffic between the victim machine and the forged IP address. In order to accomplish the required sniffing, attackers typically attempt to locate themselves on the same subnet as the victim machine. Attackers may be able to circumvent this requirement by using source routing, but source routing is disabled across much of the Internet today. In summary, IP address verification can be a useful part of an authentication scheme, but it should not be the single factor required for authentication.",

Attackers can forge the source IP address of the packets they send, but response packets will return to the forged IP address. To see the response packets, the attacker has to sniff the traffic between the victim machine and the forged IP address. In order to accomplish the required sniffing, attackers typically attempt to locate themselves on the same subnet as the victim machine. Attackers may be able to circumvent this requirement by using source routing, but source routing is disabled across much of the Internet today. In summary, IP address verification can be a useful part of an authentication scheme, but it should not be the single factor required for authentication.",

Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-30275: Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1126: A vulnerability in the storage of proxy server credentials of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view credentials for a configured proxy server. The vulnerability is due to clear-text storage and weak permissions of related configuration files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the CLI of the affected software and viewing the contents of the affected files. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view the credentials that are used to access the proxy server.\n\n- CVE-2021-41023: A unprotected storage of credentials in Fortinet FortiSIEM Windows Agent version 4.1.4 and below allows an authenticated user to disclosure agent password due to plaintext credential storage in log files\n\n- CVE-2021-1589: A vulnerability in the disaster recovery feature of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to user credentials. This vulnerability exists because access to API endpoints is not properly restricted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a request to an API endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to administrative credentials that could be used in further attacks.\n\n- CVE-2021-41297: ECOA BAS controller is vulnerable to weak access control mechanism allowing authenticated user to remotely escalate privileges by disclosing credentials of administrative accounts in plain-text.\n\n- CVE-2021-21590: Dell EMC Unity, Unity XT, and UnityVSA versions prior to 5.1.0.0.5.394 contain a plain-text password storage vulnerability. A local malicious user with high privileges may use the exposed password to gain access with the privileges of the compromised user.\n\n- CVE-2021-21591: Dell EMC Unity, Unity XT, and UnityVSA versions prior to 5.1.0.0.5.394 contain a plain-text password storage vulnerability. A local malicious user with high privileges may use the exposed password to gain access with the privileges of the compromised user.\n\n- CVE-2021-36309: Dell Enterprise SONiC OS, versions 3.3.0 and earlier, contains a sensitive information disclosure vulnerability. An authenticated malicious user with access to the system may use the TACACS\\\\Radius credentials stored to read sensitive information and use it in further attacks.\n\n- CVE-2021-23207: An attacker with physical access to the host can extract the secrets from the registry and create valid JWT tokens for the Fresenius Kabi Vigilant MasterMed version 2.0.1.3 application and impersonate arbitrary users. An attacker could manipulate RabbitMQ queues and messages by impersonating users.\n\n- CVE-2021-32978: The programming protocol allows for a previously entered password and lock state to be read by an attacker. If the previously entered password was successful, the attacker can then use the password to unlock Automation Direct CLICK PLC CPU Modules: C0-1x CPUs with firmware prior to v3.00.\n\n- CVE-2021-37401: An attacker may obtain the user credentials from file servers, backup repositories, or ZLD files saved in SD cards. As a result, the PLC user program may be uploaded, altered, and/or downloaded.\n\n- CVE-2021-43978: Allegro WIndows 3.3.4152.0, embeds software administrator database credentials into its binary files, which allows users to access and modify data using the same credentials.\n\n- CVE-2021-30948: An inconsistent user interface issue was addressed with improved state management. This issue is fixed in iOS 15.2 and iPadOS 15.2. A person with physical access to an iOS device may be able to access stored passwords without authentication.\n\n- CVE-2020-25184: Rockwell Automation ISaGRAF Runtime Versions 4.x and 5.x stores the password in plaintext in a file that is in the same directory as the executable file. ISaGRAF Runtime reads the file and saves the data in a variable without any additional modification. A local, unauthenticated attacker could compromise the user passwords, resulting in information disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2020-29583: Firmware version 4.60 of Zyxel USG devices contains an undocumented account (zyfwp) with an unchangeable password. The password for this account can be found in cleartext in the firmware. This account can be used by someone to login to the ssh server or web interface with admin privileges.\n\n- CVE-2022-31085: LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups, DHCP settings) stored in an LDAP directory. In versions prior to 8.0 the session files include the LDAP user name and password in clear text if the PHP OpenSSL extension is not installed or encryption is disabled by configuration. This issue has been fixed in version 8.0. Users unable to upgrade should install the PHP OpenSSL extension and make sure session encryption is enabled in LAM main configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-28498: In Arista's MOS (Metamako Operating System) software which is supported on the 7130 product line, user enable passwords set in clear text could result in unprivileged users getting complete access to the systems. This issue affects: Arista Metamako Operating System MOS-0.13 and post releases in the MOS-0.1x train MOS-0.26.6 and prior releases in the MOS-0.2x train MOS-0.31.1 and prior releases in the MOS-0.3x train\n\n- CVE-2021-42913: The SyncThru Web Service on Samsung SCX-6x55X printers allows an attacker to gain access to a list of SMB users and cleartext passwords by reading the HTML source code. Authentication is not required.\n\n- CVE-2022-28167: Brocade SANnav before Brocade SANvav v. 2.2.0.2 and Brocade SANanv v.2.1.1.8 logs the Brocade Fabric OS switch password in plain text in asyncjobscheduler-manager.log\n\n- CVE-2022-39816: In NOKIA 1350 OMS R14.2, Insufficiently Protected Credentials (cleartext administrator password) occur in the edit configuration page. Exploitation requires an authenticated attacker.\n\n- CVE-2022-41575: A credential-exposure vulnerability in the support-bundle mechanism in Gradle Enterprise 2022.3 through 2022.3.3 allows remote attackers to access a subset of application data (e.g., cleartext credentials). This is fixed in 2022.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2022-41933: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. When the `reset a forgotten password` feature of XWiki was used, the password was then stored in plain text in database. This only concerns XWiki 13.1RC1 and newer versions. Note that it only concerns the reset password feature available from the \"Forgot your password\" link in the login view: the features allowing a user to change their password, or for an admin to change a user password are not impacted. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous in combination with other vulnerabilities allowing to perform data leak of personal data from users, such as GHSA-599v-w48h-rjrm. Note that this vulnerability only concerns the users of the main wiki: in case of farms, the users registered on subwiki are not impacted thanks to a bug we discovered when investigating this. The problem has been patched in version 14.6RC1, 14.4.3 and 13.10.8. The patch involves a migration of the impacted users as well as the history of the page, to ensure no password remains in plain text in the database. This migration also involves to inform the users about the possible disclosure of their passwords: by default, two emails are automatically sent to the impacted users. A first email to inform about the possibility that their password have been leaked, and a second email using the reset password feature to ask them to set a new password. It's also possible for administrators to set some properties for the migration: it's possible to decide if the user password should be reset (default) or if the passwords should be kept but only hashed. Note that in the first option, the users won't be able to login anymore until they set a new password if they were impacted. Note that in both options, mails will be sent to users to inform them and encourage them to change their passwords.\n\n- CVE-2022-4312:  A cleartext storage of sensitive information vulnerability exists in PcVue versions 8.10 through 15.2.3. This could allow an unauthorized user with access the email and short messaging service (SMS) accounts configuration files to discover the associated simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) account credentials and the SIM card PIN code. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unauthorized user access to the underlying email account and SIM card. \n\n- CVE-2022-1794: The CODESYS OPC DA Server prior V3.5.18.20 stores PLC passwords as plain text in its configuration file so that it is visible to all authorized Microsoft Windows users of the system.\n\n- CVE-2022-22458:  IBM Security Verify Governance, Identity Manager 10.0.1 stores user credentials in plain clear text which can be read by a remote authenticated user.

In versions prior to 8.7.49, 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1 TYPO3 is vulnerable to Improper Authentication. Restricting frontend login to specific users, organized in different storage folders (partitions), can be bypassed. A potential attacker might use this ambiguity in usernames to get access to a different account - however, credentials must be known to the adversary. This issue is patched in versions 8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23600: fleet is an open source device management, built on osquery. Versions prior to 4.9.1 expose a limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with missing audience verification. This impacts deployments using SAML SSO in two specific cases: 1. A malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) could reuse the SAML response to log into Fleet as a user -- only if the user has an account with the same email in Fleet, _and_ the user signs into the malicious SP via SAML SSO from the same Identity Provider (IdP) configured with Fleet. 2. A user with an account in Fleet could reuse a SAML response intended for another SP to log into Fleet. This is only a concern if the user is blocked from Fleet in the IdP, but continues to have an account in Fleet. If the user is blocked from the IdP entirely, this cannot be exploited. Fleet 4.9.1 resolves this issue. Users unable to upgrade should: Reduce the length of sessions on your IdP to reduce the window for malicious re-use, Limit the amount of SAML Service Providers/Applications used by user accounts with access to Fleet, and When removing access to Fleet in the IdP, delete the Fleet user from Fleet as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24259: An incorrect check in the component cdr.php of Voipmonitor GUI before v24.96 allows unauthenticated attackers to escalate privileges via a crafted request.\n\n- CVE-2022-24883: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Prior to version 2.7.0, server side authentication against a `SAM` file might be successful for invalid credentials if the server has configured an invalid `SAM` file path. FreeRDP based clients are not affected. RDP server implementations using FreeRDP to authenticate against a `SAM` file are affected. Version 2.7.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, use custom authentication via `HashCallback` and/or ensure the `SAM` database path configured is valid and the application has file handles left.\n\n- CVE-2022-24885: Nextcloud Android app is the Android client for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to version 3.19.1, users can bypass a lock on the Nextcloud app on an Android device by repeatedly reopening the app. Version 3.19.1 contains a fix for the problem. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24976: Atheme IRC Services before 7.2.12, when used in conjunction with InspIRCd, allows authentication bypass by ending an IRC handshake at a certain point during a challenge-response login sequence.\n\n- CVE-2022-2533: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 12.10 before 15.1.6, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.4, all versions starting from 15.3 before 15.3.2.

As a result, nodes that do not have the correct authentication key are not prevented from communicating with other nodes in the cluster.\n\n- CVE-2022-2572: In affected versions of Octopus Server where access is managed by an external authentication provider, it was possible that the API key/keys of a disabled/deleted user were still valid after the access was revoked.\n\n- CVE-2022-26504: Improper authentication in Veeam Backup & Replication 9.5U3, 9.5U4,10.x and 11.x component used for Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) allows attackers execute arbitrary code via Veeam.Backup.PSManager.exe\n\n- CVE-2022-26562: An issue in provider/libserver/ECKrbAuth.cpp of Kopano Core <= v11.0.2.51 contains an issue which allows attackers to authenticate even if the user account or password is expired. It also exists in the predecessor Zarafa Collaboration Platform (ZCP) in provider/libserver/ECPamAuth.cpp of Zarafa >= 6.30 (introduced between 6.30.0 RC1e and 6.30.8 final).\n\n- CVE-2022-3477: The tagDiv Composer WordPress plugin before 3.5, required by the Newspaper WordPress theme before 12.1 and Newsmag WordPress theme before 5.2.2, does not properly implement the Facebook login feature, allowing unauthenticated attackers to login as any user by just knowing their email address\n\n- CVE-2022-36106: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released under the GNU GPL. It has been discovered that the expiration time of a password reset link for TYPO3 backend users has never been evaluated. As a result, a password reset link could be used to perform a password reset even if the default expiry time of two hours has been exceeded. Update to TYPO3 version 10.4.32 or 11.5.16 that fix the problem. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36412: In Zoho ManageEngine SupportCenter Plus before 11023, V3 API requests are vulnerable to authentication bypass. (An API request may, in effect, be executed with the credentials of a user who authenticated in the past.)\n\n- CVE-2022-39238: Arvados is an open source platform for managing and analyzing biomedical big data. In versions prior to 2.4.3, when using Portable Authentication Modules (PAM) for user authentication, if a user presented valid credentials but the account is disabled or otherwise not allowed to access the host (such as an expired password), it would still be accepted for access to Arvados. Other authentication methods (LDAP, OpenID Connect) supported by Arvados are not affected by this flaw. This issue is patched in version 2.4.3. Workaround for this issue is to migrate to a different authentication method supported by Arvados, such as LDAP.\n\n- CVE-2022-39263: `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding.\n\n- CVE-2022-39355: Discourse Patreon enables syncronization between Discourse Groups and Patreon rewards. On sites with Patreon login enabled, an improper authentication vulnerability could be used to take control of a victim's forum account. This vulnerability is patched in commit number 846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e of the discourse-patreon plugin. Out of an abundance of caution, any Discourse accounts which have logged in with an unverified-email Patreon account will be logged out and asked to verify their email address on their next login. As a workaround, disable the patreon integration and log out all users with associated Patreon accounts.\n\n- CVE-2021-3632: A flaw was found in Keycloak. This vulnerability allows anyone to register a new security device or key when there is not a device already registered for any user by using the WebAuthn password-less login flow.\n\n- CVE-2022-46170: CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. When an application uses (1) multiple session cookies (e.g., one for user pages and one for admin pages) and (2) a session handler is set to `DatabaseHandler`, `MemcachedHandler`, or `RedisHandler`, then if an attacker gets one session cookie (e.g., one for user pages), they may be able to access pages that require another session cookie (e.g., for admin pages). This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.2.11 or later. As a workaround, use only one session cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-46316: A thread security vulnerability exists in the authentication process. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-30034: Flower, a web UI for the Celery Python RPC framework, all versions as of 05-02-2022 is vulnerable to an OAuth authentication bypass.

Versions prior to 2.7.13 in `stable`, 2.8.0.beta11 in `beta`, and 2.8.0.beta11 in `tests-passed` allow some users to log in to a community before they should be able to do so. A user invited via email to a forum with `must_approve_users` enabled is going to be automatically logged in, bypassing the check that does not allow unapproved users to sign in. They will be able to do everything an approved user can do. If they logout, they cannot log back in. This issue is patched in the `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11. One may disable invites as a workaround. Administrators can increase `min_trust_level_to_allow_invite` to reduce the attack surface to more trusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-2303: An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1. It may be possible for group members to bypass 2FA enforcement enabled at the group level by using Resource Owner Password Credentials grant to obtain an access token without using 2FA.\n\n- CVE-2022-34908: An issue was discovered in the A4N (Aremis 4 Nomad) application 1.5.0 for Android. It possesses an authentication mechanism; however, some features do not require any token or cookie in a request. Therefore, an attacker may send a simple HTTP request to the right endpoint, and obtain authorization to retrieve application data.\n\n- CVE-2022-36755: D-Link DIR845L A1 contains a authentication vulnerability via an AUTHORIZED_GROUP=1 value, as demonstrated by a request for getcfg.php.\n\n- CVE-2022-43400: A vulnerability has been identified in Siveillance Video Mobile Server V2022 R2 (All versions < V22.2a (80)).

This allows an attacker to use one AK, EK pair from a real TPM to pass EK validation and give the verifier an AK of a software TPM. A successful attack breaks the entire chain of trust because a not validated AK is used by the verifier. This issue is worse if the validation happens first and then the agent gets added to the verifier because the timing is easier and the verifier does not validate the regcount entry being equal to 1,\n\n- CVE-2022-45124: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the User authentication functionality of WellinTech KingHistorian 35.01.00.05. A specially crafted network packet can lead to a disclosure of sensitive information.

Due to a bug in ASF code `POST /Api/ASF` ASF API endpoint responsible for updating global ASF config incorrectly removed `IPCPassword` from the resulting config when the caller did not specify it explicitly. Due to the above, it was possible for the user to accidentally remove `IPCPassword` security measure from his IPC interface when updating global ASF config, which exists as part of global config update functionality in ASF-ui. Removal of `IPCPassword` possesses a security risk, as unauthorized users may in result access the IPC interface after such modification. The issue is patched in ASF V5.1.2.4 and future versions. We recommend to manually verify that `IPCPassword` is specified after update, and if not, set it accordingly. In default settings, ASF is configured to allow IPC access from `localhost` only and should not affect majority of users.\n\n- CVE-2021-3282: HashiCorp Vault Enterprise 1.6.0 & 1.6.1 allowed the `remove-peer` raft operator command to be executed against DR secondaries without authentication.

Prior to version 1.10.7, FreeSWITCH does not authenticate SIP MESSAGE requests, leading to spam and message spoofing. By default, SIP requests of the type MESSAGE (RFC 3428) are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. MESSAGE requests are relayed to SIP user agents registered with the FreeSWITCH server without requiring any authentication. Although this behaviour can be changed by setting the `auth-messages` parameter to `true`, it is not the default setting. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to send SIP MESSAGE messages to any SIP user agent that is registered with the server without requiring authentication. Additionally, since no authentication is required, chat messages can be spoofed to appear to come from trusted entities. Therefore, abuse can lead to spam and enable social engineering, phishing and similar attacks. This issue is patched in version 1.10.7. Maintainers recommend that this SIP message type is authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to be explicitly set the `auth-messages` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-38412: Properly formatted POST requests to multiple resources on the HTTP and HTTPS web servers of the Digi PortServer TS 16 Rack device do not require authentication or authentication tokens.

By default, SIP requests of the type SUBSCRIBE are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to subscribe to user agent event notifications without the need to authenticate. This abuse poses privacy concerns and might lead to social engineering or similar attacks. For example, attackers may be able to monitor the status of target SIP extensions. Although this issue was fixed in version v1.10.6, installations upgraded to the fixed version of FreeSWITCH from an older version, may still be vulnerable if the configuration is not updated accordingly. Software upgrades do not update the configuration by default. SIP SUBSCRIBE messages should be authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to explicitly set the `auth-subscriptions` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2020-25566: In SapphireIMS 5.0, it is possible to take over an account by sending a request to the Save_Password form as shown in POC.

A malicious user can modify the contents of a `confirmation_token` input during the two-factor authentication process to reference a cache value not associated with the login attempt. In rare cases this can allow a malicious actor to authenticate as a random user in the Panel. The malicious user must target an account with two-factor authentication enabled, and then must provide a correct two-factor authentication token before being authenticated as that user. Due to a validation flaw in the logic handling user authentication during the two-factor authentication process a malicious user can trick the system into loading credentials for an arbitrary user by modifying the token sent to the server. This authentication flaw is present in the `LoginCheckpointController@__invoke` method which handles two-factor authentication for a user. This controller looks for a request input parameter called `confirmation_token` which is expected to be a 64 character random alpha-numeric string that references a value within the Panel's cache containing a `user_id` value. This value is then used to fetch the user that attempted to login, and lookup their two-factor authentication token. Due to the design of this system, any element in the cache that contains only digits could be referenced by a malicious user, and whatever value is stored at that position would be used as the `user_id`. There are a few different areas of the Panel that store values into the cache that are integers, and a user who determines what those cache keys are could pass one of those keys which would cause this code pathway to reference an arbitrary user. At its heart this is a high-risk login bypass vulnerability. However, there are a few additional conditions that must be met in order for this to be successfully executed, notably: 1.) The account referenced by the malicious cache key must have two-factor authentication enabled. An account without two-factor authentication would cause an exception to be triggered by the authentication logic, thusly exiting this authentication flow. 2.) Even if the malicious user is able to reference a valid cache key that references a valid user account with two-factor authentication, they must provide a valid two-factor authentication token. However, due to the design of this endpoint once a valid user account is found with two-factor authentication enabled there is no rate-limiting present, thusly allowing an attacker to brute force combinations until successful. This leads to a third condition that must be met: 3.) For the duration of this attack sequence the cache key being referenced must continue to exist with a valid `user_id` value. Depending on the specific key being used for this attack, this value may disappear quickly, or be changed by other random user interactions on the Panel, outside the control of the attacker. In order to mitigate this vulnerability the underlying authentication logic was changed to use an encrypted session store that the user is therefore unable to control the value of. This completely removed the use of a user-controlled value being used. In addition, the code was audited to ensure this type of vulnerability is not present elsewhere.\n\n- CVE-2021-42338: 4MOSAn GCB Doctor\u2019s login page has improper validation of Cookie, which allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass authentication by code injection in cookie, and arbitrarily manipulate the system or interrupt services by upload and execution of arbitrary files.\n\n- CVE-2021-1541: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an attacker to do the following: Hijack a user session Execute arbitrary commands as a root user on the underlying operating system Conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack Conduct an HTML injection attack For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-41317: XSS Hunter Express before 2021-09-17 does not properly enforce authentication requirements for paths.\n\n- CVE-2021-29012: DMA Softlab Radius Manager 4.4.0 assigns the same session cookie to every admin session.

As a workaround, one may disable basic authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-21378: Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In Envoy version 1.17.0 an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list when Envoy's JWT Authentication filter is configured with the `allow_missing` requirement under `requires_any` due to a mistake in implementation. Envoy's JWT Authentication filter can be configured with the `allow_missing` requirement that will be satisfied if JWT is missing (JwtMissed error) and fail if JWT is presented or invalid. Due to a mistake in implementation, a JwtUnknownIssuer error was mistakenly converted to JwtMissed when `requires_any` was configured. So if `allow_missing` was configured under `requires_any`, an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list. Integrity may be impacted depending on configuration if the JWT token is used to protect against writes or modifications. This regression was introduced on 2020/11/12 in PR 13839 which fixed handling `allow_missing` under RequiresAny in a JwtRequirement (see issue 13458). The AnyVerifier aggregates the children verifiers' results into a final status where JwtMissing is the default error. However, a JwtUnknownIssuer was mistakenly treated the same as a JwtMissing error and the resulting final aggregation was the default JwtMissing. As a result, `allow_missing` would allow a JWT token with an unknown issuer status. This is fixed in version 1.17.1 by PR 15194. The fix works by preferring JwtUnknownIssuer over a JwtMissing error, fixing the accidental conversion and bypass with `allow_missing`. A user could detect whether a bypass occurred if they have Envoy logs enabled with debug verbosity. Users can enable component level debug logs for JWT. The JWT filter logs will indicate that there is a request with a JWT token and a failure that the JWT token is missing.\n\n- CVE-2021-21513: Dell EMC OpenManage Server Administrator (OMSA) version 9.5 Microsoft Windows installations with Distributed Web Server (DWS) enabled configuration contains an authentication bypass vulnerability.

It mishandles software updates such that local third-party apps can provide a spoofed software update file that contains an arbitrary shell script and arbitrary ARM binary, where both will be executed as the root user with an SELinux domain named osi. To exploit this vulnerability, a local third-party app needs to have write access to external storage to write the spoofed update at the expected path. The vulnerable system binary (i.e., /system/bin/osi_bin) does not perform any authentication of the update file beyond ensuring that it is encrypted with an AES key (that is hard-coded in the vulnerable system binary). Processes executing with the osi SELinux domain can programmatically perform the following actions: install apps, grant runtime permissions to apps (including permissions with protection levels of dangerous and development), access extensive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) using the programmatically grant permissions, uninstall apps, set the default launcher app to a malicious launcher app that spoofs other apps, set a network proxy to intercept network traffic, unload kernel modules, set the default keyboard to a keyboard that has keylogging functionality, examine notification contents, send text messages, and more. The spoofed update can optionally contain an arbitrary ARM binary that will be locally stored in internal storage and executed at system startup to achieve persistent code execution as the root user with the osi SELinux domain. This ARM binary will continue to execute at startup even if the app that provided the spoofed update is uninstalled.\n\n- CVE-2020-7352: The GalaxyClientService component of GOG Galaxy runs with elevated SYSTEM privileges in a Windows environment.

The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker. Some kinds of sensitive information include:\n\n\n  - private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details\n\n  - system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages\n\n  - business secrets and intellectual property\n\n  - network status and configuration\n\n  - the product's own code or internal state\n\n  - metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers\n\n  - indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider\n\nInformation might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected. These parties include:\n\n  - the product's own users\n\n  - people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users\n\n  - the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates\n\n  - the developer\n\nInformation exposures can occur in different ways:\n\n  - the code  **explicitly inserts**  sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been \"scrubbed\" or \"sanitized\"\n\n  - a different weakness or mistake  **indirectly inserts**  the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.\n\n  - the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are  **unintentionally made accessible**  to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.\n\nIt is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read. CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store, transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-31162: Rust library leaks Oauth client details in application debug logs\n\n- CVE-2021-25476: Digital Rights Management (DRM) capability for mobile platform leaks pointer information, simplifying ASLR bypass\n\n- CVE-2001-1483: Enumeration of valid usernames based on inconsistent responses\n\n- CVE-2001-1528: Account number enumeration via inconsistent responses.\n\n- CVE-2004-2150: User enumeration via discrepancies in error messages.\n\n- CVE-2005-1205: Telnet protocol allows servers to obtain sensitive environment information from clients.\n\n- CVE-2002-1725: Script calls phpinfo(), revealing system configuration to web user\n\n- CVE-2002-0515: Product sets a different TTL when a port is being filtered than when it is not being filtered, which allows remote attackers to identify filtered ports by comparing TTLs.\n\n- CVE-2004-0778: Version control system allows remote attackers to determine the existence of arbitrary files and directories via the -X command for an alternate history file, which causes different error messages to be returned.\n\n- CVE-2000-1117: Virtual machine allows malicious web site operators to determine the existence of files on the client by measuring delays in the execution of the getSystemResource method.\n\n- CVE-2003-0190: Product immediately sends an error message when a user does not exist, which allows remote attackers to determine valid usernames via a timing attack.\n\n- CVE-2008-2049: POP3 server reveals a password in an error message after multiple APOP commands are sent.

In affected versions users who use [`HttpAuthMiddleware`](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth) (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for Splash authentication will have any non-Splash request expose your credentials to the request target. This includes `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`. Upgrade to scrapy-splash 0.8.0 and use the new `SPLASH_USER` and `SPLASH_PASS` settings instead to set your Splash authentication credentials safely. If you cannot upgrade, set your Splash request credentials on a per-request basis, [using the `splash_headers` request parameter](https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash/tree/0.8.x#http-basic-auth), instead of defining them globally using the [`HttpAuthMiddleware`](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth). Alternatively, make sure all your requests go through Splash. That includes disabling the [robots.txt middleware](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#topics-dlmw-robots).\n\n- CVE-2021-32720: Sylius is an Open Source eCommerce platform on top of Symfony. In versions of Sylius prior to 1.9.5 and 1.10.0-RC.1, part of the details (order ID, order number, items total, and token value) of all placed orders were exposed to unauthorized users. If exploited properly, a few additional information like the number of items in the cart and the date of the shipping may be fetched as well. This data seems to not be crucial nor is personal data, however, could be used for sociotechnical attacks or may expose a few details about shop condition to the third parties. The data possible to aggregate are the number of processed orders or their value in the moment of time. The problem has been patched at Sylius 1.9.5 and 1.10.0-RC.1. There are a few workarounds for the vulnerability. The first possible solution is to hide the problematic endpoints behind the firewall from not logged in users. This would put only the order list under the firewall and allow only authorized users to access it. Once a user is authorized, it will have access to theirs orders only. The second possible solution is to decorate the `\\\\Sylius\\\\Bundle\\\\ApiBundle\\\\Doctrine\\\\QueryCollectionExtension\\\\OrdersByLoggedInUserExtension` and throw `Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Security\\\\Core\\\\Exception\\\\AccessDeniedException` if the class is executed for unauthorized user.\n\n- CVE-2021-39192: Ghost is a Node.js content management system.

It is also distinct from \"AuthZ,\" which is an abbreviation of \"authorization.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\nAuthC: \"AuthC\" is used as an abbreviation of \"authentication,\" but it appears to used less frequently than \"AuthN.\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication\n- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.\n- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product constructs all or part of an LDAP query using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended LDAP query when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-943\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Factors: resultant to special character mismanagement, MAID, or denylist/allowlist problems. Can be primary to authentication and verification errors.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-41232:** Chain: authentication routine in Go-based agile development product does not escape user name (CWE-116), allowing LDAP injection (CWE-90)\n- **CVE-2005-2301:** Server does not properly escape LDAP queries, which allows remote attackers to cause a DoS and possibly conduct an LDAP injection attack.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-540: Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Source Code\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nSource code on a web server or repository often contains sensitive information and should generally not be accessible to users.\n\n### Extended Description\nThere are situations where it is critical to remove source code from an area or server. For example, obtaining Perl source code on a system allows an attacker to understand the logic of the script and extract extremely useful information such as code bugs or logins and passwords.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-538\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-25512:** Server for Team Awareness Kit (TAK) application includes sensitive tokens in the JavaScript source code.\n- **CVE-2022-24867:** The LDAP password might be visible in the html code of a rendered page in an IT Asset Management tool.\n- **CVE-2007-6197:** Version numbers and internal hostnames leaked in HTML comments.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nAccording to WASC, \"Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization.\"\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nCanPrecede -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\nChildOf -> CWE-798\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** The main difference between the use of hard-coded passwords and the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys is the false sense of security that the former conveys. Many people believe that simply hashing a hard-coded password before storage will protect the information from malicious users. However, many hashes are reversible (or at least vulnerable to brute force attacks) -- and further, many authentication protocols simply request the hash itself, making it no better than a password.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29960:** Engineering Workstation uses hard-coded cryptographic keys that could allow for unathorized filesystem access and privilege escalation\n- **CVE-2022-30271:** Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a hard-coded SSH private key that is likely to be used by default.\n- **CVE-2020-10884:** WiFi router service has a hard-coded encryption key, allowing root access\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis incorrect implementation may allow authentication to be bypassed.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-1390\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2003-0750:** Conditional should have been an 'or' not an 'and'.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-306\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nPeerOf -> CWE-420\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

In some contexts, even storage of a plaintext password in memory is considered a security risk if the password is not cleared immediately after it is used.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-30275: Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) uses a driver that relies on a password stored in plaintext.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1126: A vulnerability in the storage of proxy server credentials of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view credentials for a configured proxy server. The vulnerability is due to clear-text storage and weak permissions of related configuration files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the CLI of the affected software and viewing the contents of the affected files. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view the credentials that are used to access the proxy server.\n\n- CVE-2021-41023: A unprotected storage of credentials in Fortinet FortiSIEM Windows Agent version 4.1.4 and below allows an authenticated user to disclosure agent password due to plaintext credential storage in log files\n\n- CVE-2021-1589: A vulnerability in the disaster recovery feature of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to user credentials. This vulnerability exists because access to API endpoints is not properly restricted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a request to an API endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to administrative credentials that could be used in further attacks.\n\n- CVE-2021-41297: ECOA BAS controller is vulnerable to weak access control mechanism allowing authenticated user to remotely escalate privileges by disclosing credentials of administrative accounts in plain-text.\n\n- CVE-2021-21590: Dell EMC Unity, Unity XT, and UnityVSA versions prior to 5.1.0.0.5.394 contain a plain-text password storage vulnerability.

This is fixed in 2022.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2022-41933: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. When the `reset a forgotten password` feature of XWiki was used, the password was then stored in plain text in database. This only concerns XWiki 13.1RC1 and newer versions. Note that it only concerns the reset password feature available from the \"Forgot your password\" link in the login view: the features allowing a user to change their password, or for an admin to change a user password are not impacted. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous in combination with other vulnerabilities allowing to perform data leak of personal data from users, such as GHSA-599v-w48h-rjrm. Note that this vulnerability only concerns the users of the main wiki: in case of farms, the users registered on subwiki are not impacted thanks to a bug we discovered when investigating this. The problem has been patched in version 14.6RC1, 14.4.3 and 13.10.8. The patch involves a migration of the impacted users as well as the history of the page, to ensure no password remains in plain text in the database. This migration also involves to inform the users about the possible disclosure of their passwords: by default, two emails are automatically sent to the impacted users. A first email to inform about the possibility that their password have been leaked, and a second email using the reset password feature to ask them to set a new password. It's also possible for administrators to set some properties for the migration: it's possible to decide if the user password should be reset (default) or if the passwords should be kept but only hashed. Note that in the first option, the users won't be able to login anymore until they set a new password if they were impacted. Note that in both options, mails will be sent to users to inform them and encourage them to change their passwords.\n\n- CVE-2022-4312:  A cleartext storage of sensitive information vulnerability exists in PcVue versions 8.10 through 15.2.3. This could allow an unauthorized user with access the email and short messaging service (SMS) accounts configuration files to discover the associated simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) account credentials and the SIM card PIN code. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unauthorized user access to the underlying email account and SIM card. \n\n- CVE-2022-1794: The CODESYS OPC DA Server prior V3.5.18.20 stores PLC passwords as plain text in its configuration file so that it is visible to all authorized Microsoft Windows users of the system.\n\n- CVE-2022-22458:  IBM Security Verify Governance, Identity Manager 10.0.1 stores user credentials in plain clear text which can be read by a remote authenticated user.

In versions prior to 8.7.49, 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1 TYPO3 is vulnerable to Improper Authentication. Restricting frontend login to specific users, organized in different storage folders (partitions), can be bypassed. A potential attacker might use this ambiguity in usernames to get access to a different account - however, credentials must be known to the adversary. This issue is patched in versions 8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23600: fleet is an open source device management, built on osquery. Versions prior to 4.9.1 expose a limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with missing audience verification. This impacts deployments using SAML SSO in two specific cases: 1. A malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) could reuse the SAML response to log into Fleet as a user -- only if the user has an account with the same email in Fleet, _and_ the user signs into the malicious SP via SAML SSO from the same Identity Provider (IdP) configured with Fleet. 2. A user with an account in Fleet could reuse a SAML response intended for another SP to log into Fleet. This is only a concern if the user is blocked from Fleet in the IdP, but continues to have an account in Fleet. If the user is blocked from the IdP entirely, this cannot be exploited. Fleet 4.9.1 resolves this issue. Users unable to upgrade should: Reduce the length of sessions on your IdP to reduce the window for malicious re-use, Limit the amount of SAML Service Providers/Applications used by user accounts with access to Fleet, and When removing access to Fleet in the IdP, delete the Fleet user from Fleet as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24259: An incorrect check in the component cdr.php of Voipmonitor GUI before v24.96 allows unauthenticated attackers to escalate privileges via a crafted request.\n\n- CVE-2022-24883: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Prior to version 2.7.0, server side authentication against a `SAM` file might be successful for invalid credentials if the server has configured an invalid `SAM` file path. FreeRDP based clients are not affected. RDP server implementations using FreeRDP to authenticate against a `SAM` file are affected. Version 2.7.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, use custom authentication via `HashCallback` and/or ensure the `SAM` database path configured is valid and the application has file handles left.\n\n- CVE-2022-24885: Nextcloud Android app is the Android client for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to version 3.19.1, users can bypass a lock on the Nextcloud app on an Android device by repeatedly reopening the app. Version 3.19.1 contains a fix for the problem. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24976: Atheme IRC Services before 7.2.12, when used in conjunction with InspIRCd, allows authentication bypass by ending an IRC handshake at a certain point during a challenge-response login sequence.\n\n- CVE-2022-2533: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 12.10 before 15.1.6, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.4, all versions starting from 15.3 before 15.3.2.

As a result, nodes that do not have the correct authentication key are not prevented from communicating with other nodes in the cluster.\n\n- CVE-2022-2572: In affected versions of Octopus Server where access is managed by an external authentication provider, it was possible that the API key/keys of a disabled/deleted user were still valid after the access was revoked.\n\n- CVE-2022-26504: Improper authentication in Veeam Backup & Replication 9.5U3, 9.5U4,10.x and 11.x component used for Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) allows attackers execute arbitrary code via Veeam.Backup.PSManager.exe\n\n- CVE-2022-26562: An issue in provider/libserver/ECKrbAuth.cpp of Kopano Core <= v11.0.2.51 contains an issue which allows attackers to authenticate even if the user account or password is expired. It also exists in the predecessor Zarafa Collaboration Platform (ZCP) in provider/libserver/ECPamAuth.cpp of Zarafa >= 6.30 (introduced between 6.30.0 RC1e and 6.30.8 final).\n\n- CVE-2022-3477: The tagDiv Composer WordPress plugin before 3.5, required by the Newspaper WordPress theme before 12.1 and Newsmag WordPress theme before 5.2.2, does not properly implement the Facebook login feature, allowing unauthenticated attackers to login as any user by just knowing their email address\n\n- CVE-2022-36106: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released under the GNU GPL. It has been discovered that the expiration time of a password reset link for TYPO3 backend users has never been evaluated. As a result, a password reset link could be used to perform a password reset even if the default expiry time of two hours has been exceeded. Update to TYPO3 version 10.4.32 or 11.5.16 that fix the problem. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36412: In Zoho ManageEngine SupportCenter Plus before 11023, V3 API requests are vulnerable to authentication bypass. (An API request may, in effect, be executed with the credentials of a user who authenticated in the past.)\n\n- CVE-2022-39238: Arvados is an open source platform for managing and analyzing biomedical big data. In versions prior to 2.4.3, when using Portable Authentication Modules (PAM) for user authentication, if a user presented valid credentials but the account is disabled or otherwise not allowed to access the host (such as an expired password), it would still be accepted for access to Arvados. Other authentication methods (LDAP, OpenID Connect) supported by Arvados are not affected by this flaw. This issue is patched in version 2.4.3. Workaround for this issue is to migrate to a different authentication method supported by Arvados, such as LDAP.\n\n- CVE-2022-39263: `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding.\n\n- CVE-2022-39355: Discourse Patreon enables syncronization between Discourse Groups and Patreon rewards. On sites with Patreon login enabled, an improper authentication vulnerability could be used to take control of a victim's forum account. This vulnerability is patched in commit number 846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e of the discourse-patreon plugin. Out of an abundance of caution, any Discourse accounts which have logged in with an unverified-email Patreon account will be logged out and asked to verify their email address on their next login. As a workaround, disable the patreon integration and log out all users with associated Patreon accounts.\n\n- CVE-2021-3632: A flaw was found in Keycloak. This vulnerability allows anyone to register a new security device or key when there is not a device already registered for any user by using the WebAuthn password-less login flow.\n\n- CVE-2022-46170: CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. When an application uses (1) multiple session cookies (e.g., one for user pages and one for admin pages) and (2) a session handler is set to `DatabaseHandler`, `MemcachedHandler`, or `RedisHandler`, then if an attacker gets one session cookie (e.g., one for user pages), they may be able to access pages that require another session cookie (e.g., for admin pages). This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.2.11 or later. As a workaround, use only one session cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-46316: A thread security vulnerability exists in the authentication process.

Versions prior to 2.7.13 in `stable`, 2.8.0.beta11 in `beta`, and 2.8.0.beta11 in `tests-passed` allow some users to log in to a community before they should be able to do so. A user invited via email to a forum with `must_approve_users` enabled is going to be automatically logged in, bypassing the check that does not allow unapproved users to sign in. They will be able to do everything an approved user can do. If they logout, they cannot log back in. This issue is patched in the `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11. One may disable invites as a workaround. Administrators can increase `min_trust_level_to_allow_invite` to reduce the attack surface to more trusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-2303: An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1.

This allows an attacker to use one AK, EK pair from a real TPM to pass EK validation and give the verifier an AK of a software TPM. A successful attack breaks the entire chain of trust because a not validated AK is used by the verifier. This issue is worse if the validation happens first and then the agent gets added to the verifier because the timing is easier and the verifier does not validate the regcount entry being equal to 1,\n\n- CVE-2022-45124: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the User authentication functionality of WellinTech KingHistorian 35.01.00.05. A specially crafted network packet can lead to a disclosure of sensitive information.

HPE has released a software update to resolve the vulnerability in the HPE Edgeline Infrastructure Manager.\n\n- CVE-2021-3145: In Ionic Identity Vault before 5, a local root attacker on an Android device can bypass biometric authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-32794: ArchiSteamFarm is a C# application with primary purpose of idling Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug in ASF code `POST /Api/ASF` ASF API endpoint responsible for updating global ASF config incorrectly removed `IPCPassword` from the resulting config when the caller did not specify it explicitly. Due to the above, it was possible for the user to accidentally remove `IPCPassword` security measure from his IPC interface when updating global ASF config, which exists as part of global config update functionality in ASF-ui. Removal of `IPCPassword` possesses a security risk, as unauthorized users may in result access the IPC interface after such modification. The issue is patched in ASF V5.1.2.4 and future versions. We recommend to manually verify that `IPCPassword` is specified after update, and if not, set it accordingly. In default settings, ASF is configured to allow IPC access from `localhost` only and should not affect majority of users.\n\n- CVE-2021-3282: HashiCorp Vault Enterprise 1.6.0 & 1.6.1 allowed the `remove-peer` raft operator command to be executed against DR secondaries without authentication. Fixed in 1.6.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-34675: Basix NEX-Forms through 7.8.7 allows authentication bypass for stored PDF reports.\n\n- CVE-2021-34676: Basix NEX-Forms through 7.8.7 allows authentication bypass for Excel report generation.\n\n- CVE-2021-35941: Western Digital WD My Book Live (2.x and later) and WD My Book Live Duo (all versions) have an administrator API that can perform a system factory restore without authentication, as exploited in the wild in June 2021, a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-18472.\n\n- CVE-2021-37415: Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus before 11302 is vulnerable to authentication bypass that allows a few REST-API URLs without authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-37420: Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus before 6112 is vulnerable to mail spoofing.\n\n- CVE-2021-37624: FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. Prior to version 1.10.7, FreeSWITCH does not authenticate SIP MESSAGE requests, leading to spam and message spoofing. By default, SIP requests of the type MESSAGE (RFC 3428) are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. MESSAGE requests are relayed to SIP user agents registered with the FreeSWITCH server without requiring any authentication. Although this behaviour can be changed by setting the `auth-messages` parameter to `true`, it is not the default setting. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to send SIP MESSAGE messages to any SIP user agent that is registered with the server without requiring authentication. Additionally, since no authentication is required, chat messages can be spoofed to appear to come from trusted entities. Therefore, abuse can lead to spam and enable social engineering, phishing and similar attacks. This issue is patched in version 1.10.7. Maintainers recommend that this SIP message type is authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to be explicitly set the `auth-messages` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-38412: Properly formatted POST requests to multiple resources on the HTTP and HTTPS web servers of the Digi PortServer TS 16 Rack device do not require authentication or authentication tokens. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to enable the SNMP service and manipulate the community strings to achieve further control in.\n\n- CVE-2021-41157: FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. By default, SIP requests of the type SUBSCRIBE are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to subscribe to user agent event notifications without the need to authenticate. This abuse poses privacy concerns and might lead to social engineering or similar attacks. For example, attackers may be able to monitor the status of target SIP extensions. Although this issue was fixed in version v1.10.6, installations upgraded to the fixed version of FreeSWITCH from an older version, may still be vulnerable if the configuration is not updated accordingly. Software upgrades do not update the configuration by default. SIP SUBSCRIBE messages should be authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to explicitly set the `auth-subscriptions` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2020-25566: In SapphireIMS 5.0, it is possible to take over an account by sending a request to the Save_Password form as shown in POC.

A malicious user can modify the contents of a `confirmation_token` input during the two-factor authentication process to reference a cache value not associated with the login attempt. In rare cases this can allow a malicious actor to authenticate as a random user in the Panel. The malicious user must target an account with two-factor authentication enabled, and then must provide a correct two-factor authentication token before being authenticated as that user. Due to a validation flaw in the logic handling user authentication during the two-factor authentication process a malicious user can trick the system into loading credentials for an arbitrary user by modifying the token sent to the server. This authentication flaw is present in the `LoginCheckpointController@__invoke` method which handles two-factor authentication for a user. This controller looks for a request input parameter called `confirmation_token` which is expected to be a 64 character random alpha-numeric string that references a value within the Panel's cache containing a `user_id` value. This value is then used to fetch the user that attempted to login, and lookup their two-factor authentication token. Due to the design of this system, any element in the cache that contains only digits could be referenced by a malicious user, and whatever value is stored at that position would be used as the `user_id`. There are a few different areas of the Panel that store values into the cache that are integers, and a user who determines what those cache keys are could pass one of those keys which would cause this code pathway to reference an arbitrary user. At its heart this is a high-risk login bypass vulnerability. However, there are a few additional conditions that must be met in order for this to be successfully executed, notably: 1.) The account referenced by the malicious cache key must have two-factor authentication enabled. An account without two-factor authentication would cause an exception to be triggered by the authentication logic, thusly exiting this authentication flow. 2.) Even if the malicious user is able to reference a valid cache key that references a valid user account with two-factor authentication, they must provide a valid two-factor authentication token. However, due to the design of this endpoint once a valid user account is found with two-factor authentication enabled there is no rate-limiting present, thusly allowing an attacker to brute force combinations until successful. This leads to a third condition that must be met: 3.) For the duration of this attack sequence the cache key being referenced must continue to exist with a valid `user_id` value. Depending on the specific key being used for this attack, this value may disappear quickly, or be changed by other random user interactions on the Panel, outside the control of the attacker. In order to mitigate this vulnerability the underlying authentication logic was changed to use an encrypted session store that the user is therefore unable to control the value of. This completely removed the use of a user-controlled value being used. In addition, the code was audited to ensure this type of vulnerability is not present elsewhere.\n\n- CVE-2021-42338: 4MOSAn GCB Doctor\u2019s login page has improper validation of Cookie, which allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass authentication by code injection in cookie, and arbitrarily manipulate the system or interrupt services by upload and execution of arbitrary files.\n\n- CVE-2021-1541: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an attacker to do the following: Hijack a user session Execute arbitrary commands as a root user on the underlying operating system Conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack Conduct an HTML injection attack For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-41317: XSS Hunter Express before 2021-09-17 does not properly enforce authentication requirements for paths.\n\n- CVE-2021-29012: DMA Softlab Radius Manager 4.4.0 assigns the same session cookie to every admin session.

As a workaround, one may disable basic authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-21378: Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In Envoy version 1.17.0 an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list when Envoy's JWT Authentication filter is configured with the `allow_missing` requirement under `requires_any` due to a mistake in implementation. Envoy's JWT Authentication filter can be configured with the `allow_missing` requirement that will be satisfied if JWT is missing (JwtMissed error) and fail if JWT is presented or invalid. Due to a mistake in implementation, a JwtUnknownIssuer error was mistakenly converted to JwtMissed when `requires_any` was configured. So if `allow_missing` was configured under `requires_any`, an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list. Integrity may be impacted depending on configuration if the JWT token is used to protect against writes or modifications. This regression was introduced on 2020/11/12 in PR 13839 which fixed handling `allow_missing` under RequiresAny in a JwtRequirement (see issue 13458). The AnyVerifier aggregates the children verifiers' results into a final status where JwtMissing is the default error. However, a JwtUnknownIssuer was mistakenly treated the same as a JwtMissing error and the resulting final aggregation was the default JwtMissing. As a result, `allow_missing` would allow a JWT token with an unknown issuer status. This is fixed in version 1.17.1 by PR 15194. The fix works by preferring JwtUnknownIssuer over a JwtMissing error, fixing the accidental conversion and bypass with `allow_missing`. A user could detect whether a bypass occurred if they have Envoy logs enabled with debug verbosity. Users can enable component level debug logs for JWT. The JWT filter logs will indicate that there is a request with a JWT token and a failure that the JWT token is missing.\n\n- CVE-2021-21513: Dell EMC OpenManage Server Administrator (OMSA) version 9.5 Microsoft Windows installations with Distributed Web Server (DWS) enabled configuration contains an authentication bypass vulnerability.

It mishandles software updates such that local third-party apps can provide a spoofed software update file that contains an arbitrary shell script and arbitrary ARM binary, where both will be executed as the root user with an SELinux domain named osi. To exploit this vulnerability, a local third-party app needs to have write access to external storage to write the spoofed update at the expected path. The vulnerable system binary (i.e., /system/bin/osi_bin) does not perform any authentication of the update file beyond ensuring that it is encrypted with an AES key (that is hard-coded in the vulnerable system binary). Processes executing with the osi SELinux domain can programmatically perform the following actions: install apps, grant runtime permissions to apps (including permissions with protection levels of dangerous and development), access extensive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) using the programmatically grant permissions, uninstall apps, set the default launcher app to a malicious launcher app that spoofs other apps, set a network proxy to intercept network traffic, unload kernel modules, set the default keyboard to a keyboard that has keylogging functionality, examine notification contents, send text messages, and more. The spoofed update can optionally contain an arbitrary ARM binary that will be locally stored in internal storage and executed at system startup to achieve persistent code execution as the root user with the osi SELinux domain. This ARM binary will continue to execute at startup even if the app that provided the spoofed update is uninstalled.\n\n- CVE-2020-7352: The GalaxyClientService component of GOG Galaxy runs with elevated SYSTEM privileges in a Windows environment.

The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker. Some kinds of sensitive information include:\n\n\n  - private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details\n\n  - system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages\n\n  - business secrets and intellectual property\n\n  - network status and configuration\n\n  - the product's own code or internal state\n\n  - metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers\n\n  - indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider\n\nInformation might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected. These parties include:\n\n  - the product's own users\n\n  - people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users\n\n  - the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates\n\n  - the developer\n\nInformation exposures can occur in different ways:\n\n  - the code  **explicitly inserts**  sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been \"scrubbed\" or \"sanitized\"\n\n  - a different weakness or mistake  **indirectly inserts**  the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.\n\n  - the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are  **unintentionally made accessible**  to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.\n\nIt is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read. CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store, transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-31162: Rust library leaks Oauth client details in application debug logs\n\n- CVE-2021-25476: Digital Rights Management (DRM) capability for mobile platform leaks pointer information, simplifying ASLR bypass\n\n- CVE-2001-1483: Enumeration of valid usernames based on inconsistent responses\n\n- CVE-2001-1528: Account number enumeration via inconsistent responses.\n\n- CVE-2004-2150: User enumeration via discrepancies in error messages.\n\n- CVE-2005-1205: Telnet protocol allows servers to obtain sensitive environment information from clients.\n\n- CVE-2002-1725: Script calls phpinfo(), revealing system configuration to web user\n\n- CVE-2002-0515: Product sets a different TTL when a port is being filtered than when it is not being filtered, which allows remote attackers to identify filtered ports by comparing TTLs.\n\n- CVE-2004-0778: Version control system allows remote attackers to determine the existence of arbitrary files and directories via the -X command for an alternate history file, which causes different error messages to be returned.\n\n- CVE-2000-1117: Virtual machine allows malicious web site operators to determine the existence of files on the client by measuring delays in the execution of the getSystemResource method.\n\n- CVE-2003-0190: Product immediately sends an error message when a user does not exist, which allows remote attackers to determine valid usernames via a timing attack.\n\n- CVE-2008-2049: POP3 server reveals a password in an error message after multiple APOP commands are sent.

In affected versions users who use [`HttpAuthMiddleware`](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth) (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for Splash authentication will have any non-Splash request expose your credentials to the request target. This includes `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`. Upgrade to scrapy-splash 0.8.0 and use the new `SPLASH_USER` and `SPLASH_PASS` settings instead to set your Splash authentication credentials safely. If you cannot upgrade, set your Splash request credentials on a per-request basis, [using the `splash_headers` request parameter](https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash/tree/0.8.x#http-basic-auth), instead of defining them globally using the [`HttpAuthMiddleware`](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth). Alternatively, make sure all your requests go through Splash. That includes disabling the [robots.txt middleware](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#topics-dlmw-robots).\n\n- CVE-2021-32720: Sylius is an Open Source eCommerce platform on top of Symfony. In versions of Sylius prior to 1.9.5 and 1.10.0-RC.1, part of the details (order ID, order number, items total, and token value) of all placed orders were exposed to unauthorized users. If exploited properly, a few additional information like the number of items in the cart and the date of the shipping may be fetched as well. This data seems to not be crucial nor is personal data, however, could be used for sociotechnical attacks or may expose a few details about shop condition to the third parties. The data possible to aggregate are the number of processed orders or their value in the moment of time. The problem has been patched at Sylius 1.9.5 and 1.10.0-RC.1. There are a few workarounds for the vulnerability. The first possible solution is to hide the problematic endpoints behind the firewall from not logged in users. This would put only the order list under the firewall and allow only authorized users to access it. Once a user is authorized, it will have access to theirs orders only. The second possible solution is to decorate the `\\\\Sylius\\\\Bundle\\\\ApiBundle\\\\Doctrine\\\\QueryCollectionExtension\\\\OrdersByLoggedInUserExtension` and throw `Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Security\\\\Core\\\\Exception\\\\AccessDeniedException` if the class is executed for unauthorized user.\n\n- CVE-2021-39192: Ghost is a Node.js content management system.
