It sits under the Authentication pillar. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is being considered as a secondary CWE, because it can follow an authentication bypass and lead to unauthorized actions. CWE-863 is a Class level and is a child of the Authorization pillar. There are no direct parent-child relationships evident between CWE-287 and CWE-863.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Authentication** (CWE-287), which allows an attacker to bypass identity verification. This leads to **privilege escalation** and unauthorized access, which can be seen as potential impacts of the initial weakness. If authentication is bypassed, then authorization checks might be performed incorrectly (CWE-863) or not at all.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified the **Improper Authentication vulnerability** as the root cause, supported by the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\". The primary focus is on CWE-287. The provided guidance on \"Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control\" helped to clarify that the initial issue is related to authentication (identity validation).\n\nThe retriever results and graph relationships influenced the decision to include CWE-863 as a secondary candidate. While the initial vulnerability is **Improper Authentication** (CWE-287), successful exploitation leads to **privilege escalation**, suggesting a potential authorization issue. The authorization might be performed incorrectly (CWE-863) after bypassing authentication.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-287 accurately represents the **root cause** (Improper Authentication), and CWE-863 represents a potential consequence (Incorrect Authorization).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used*: While privilege escalation is a result, the root cause isn't about assigning wrong privilege but bypassing authentication.\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used*: Not about unsafe actions, but about authentication issues.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
