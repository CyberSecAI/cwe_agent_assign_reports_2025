This allowed unauthenticated users to access PDF files by guessing the IDs.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Missing authentication/authorization check for PDF file access.\n*   Predictable PDF file IDs.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nUnauthenticated users could access sensitive PDF files (e.g., substitution plans, class register printouts) generated within the last 24 hours.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n1.  Trigger the generation of a PDF file.\n2.  Determine the PDF file ID from the GraphQL request.\n3.  Iterate through IDs (upwards or downwards) to access other PDF files.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   No authentication required.\n*   Ability to trigger PDF file generation.\n*   Ability to intercept and analyze GraphQL requests to determine PDF IDs.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The issue has been fixed in AlekSIS core versions 4.0.0, 3.1.7, and 3.2.2.\n*   Update installations using `pip3 install -U aleksis-core==3.1.7` or `pip3 install -U aleksis-core==3.2.2`.\n\n**Additional details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   PDF files are automatically deleted after 24 hours, limiting the duration of access.\n*   The vulnerability was discovered during a security audit as part of the NGI0 Entrust grant.\n*   The code snippet provided shows the conditional permission check: `if has_person(info.context) and info.context.user.person != pdf_file.person:`",

The vulnerability description clearly indicates that no authentication was required to access the PDF files, thus leading to the selection of CWE-306. CWE-862 was considered as a possible alternative or secondary weakness if authentication was present but authorization was missing, however, the evidence strongly suggests a complete lack of authentication.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass\"]\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe288 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **missing authentication** check for accessing PDF files (CWE-306). Because no authentication is required, any user can access the PDF files, leading to **improper access control**. This ultimately results in the exposure of sensitive information contained within the PDF files.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly states that unauthenticated users can access all PDF files due to **incorrect access control**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the permission check for accessing PDF files was only active if a user had a person associated with their account, effectively bypassing authentication for unauthenticated users.\n\nBased on this evidence, CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was selected as the primary CWE because the core issue is the absence of an authentication mechanism for accessing sensitive PDF files. If authentication was present, then the access control would fall under an authorization context.\n\nThe selection of CWE-306 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the lack of authentication.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
