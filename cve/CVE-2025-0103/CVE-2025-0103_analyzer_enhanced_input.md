## Analysis of CVE-2025-0103 Content

This content is directly related to CVE-2025-0103 as it is a security advisory (PAN-SA-2025-0001) from Palo Alto Networks detailing multiple vulnerabilities, including the one identified by CVE-2025-0103, in the Expedition migration tool. The content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

An SQL injection vulnerability in Palo Alto Networks Expedition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL injection (CVE-2025-0103)
*   Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) (CVE-2025-0104)
*   Arbitrary file deletion (CVE-2025-0105)
*   Wildcard expansion (CVE-2025-0106)
*   OS command injection (CVE-2025-0107)

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **CVE-2025-0103:** An authenticated attacker can reveal Expedition database contents (password hashes, usernames, device configurations, device API keys). Attackers can also create and read arbitrary files on the Expedition system.
*   **CVE-2025-0104:** Attackers can execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of an authenticated userâ€™s browser, potentially leading to browser-session theft.
*   **CVE-2025-0105:** An unauthenticated attacker can delete arbitrary files accessible to the www-data user.
*   **CVE-2025-0106:** An unauthenticated attacker can enumerate files on the host filesystem.
*   **CVE-2025-0107:** An unauthenticated attacker can run arbitrary OS commands as the www-data user, potentially disclosing sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **CVE-2025-0103:** Network, SQL injection. Requires authentication.
*   **CVE-2025-0104:** Network, reflected XSS. Requires user interaction (clicking a malicious link).
*   **CVE-2025-0105:** Network, arbitrary file deletion. No authentication required.
*   **CVE-2025-0106:** Network, wildcard expansion. No authentication required.
*   **CVE-2025-0107:** Network, OS command injection. No authentication required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **CVE-2025-0103:** Authenticated attacker.
*   **CVE-2025-0104:** Attacker capable of creating and distributing malicious links.
*   **CVE-2025-0105, CVE-2025-0106, CVE-2025-0107:** No specific capabilities required, unauthenticated access is sufficient.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Upgrade Expedition to version 1.2.100 or later (fixes CVE-2025-0103, CVE-2025-0104, CVE-2025-0107).
*   Upgrade Expedition to version 1.2.101 or later (fixes CVE-2025-0105, CVE-2025-0106).
*   However, Expedition is End-of-Life (EoL) and no further updates are planned.
*   **Workarounds:** Restrict network access to Expedition to authorized users/hosts/networks. Shut down Expedition if not actively in use.
