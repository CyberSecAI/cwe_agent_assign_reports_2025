  "description": "The eMagicOne Store Manager for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to **insufficient file path validation** in the delete_file() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). This is only exploitable by unauthenticated attackers in **default configurations** where the the **default password** is left as 11, or where the attacker gains access to the credentials.",

  "reference_content": "Here's an analysis of the content you provided, focusing on CVE-2025-4603:\n\n**1. Verification of Relevance:**\n\nThe content from `ryankozak.com_09bf52e1_20250625_042044.html` and `github.com_3086224c_20250625_022913.html`  directly relates to CVE-2025-4603.  The other documents are unrelated as they are either general GitHub documentation or WordPress plugin information.\n\n**2. Extracted Information:**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a remote management protocol endpoint (`?connector=bridge`) in the eMagicOne Store Manager for WooCommerce plugin. This endpoint allows file deletion operations. The authentication mechanism relies on default credentials (`login=1`, `password=1`) and a session key system. If the default credentials are not changed, an attacker can easily authenticate, obtain a session key, and delete arbitrary files.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    *   Unauthenticated arbitrary file deletion.\n    *   Use of default, easily guessable credentials.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can delete arbitrary files from the WordPress root directory or any accessible directory, including critical configuration files like `wp-config.php`.\n*   **Attack vectors:**\n    *   Sending a POST request to the `?connector=bridge` endpoint with the correct hash (derived from the default credentials) and a task to get a session key.\n    *   Using the obtained session key in a subsequent POST request to the same endpoint, along with the `delete_file` task and the path to the file to be deleted.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n    *   Ability to send HTTP POST requests.\n    *   Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint (`?connector=bridge`).\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** The `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` file shows the updated version that addresses this security issue by modifying the default credentials.\n\n**3. Further details than the CVE description**\nThe provided content gives a detailed reproduction of the vulnerability, which is more comprehensive than the official CVE description (which is a placeholder). It includes:\n- The vulnerable code snippets.\n- A Proof of Concept (POC)\n- Step by step explanation to reproduce the vulnerability.",
