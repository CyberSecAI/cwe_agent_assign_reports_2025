The formWlEncrypt CGI handler in the boa program **fails to limit the length of the wlan_ssid field from user input**. This allows attackers to craft malicious HTTP requests by supplying an excessively long value for the wlan_ssid field, leading to a **stack overflow**. This can be further exploited to execute arbitrary commands or launch denial-of-service attacks.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'fails to limit the length of the wlan_ssid field from user input', 'weakness': ['Buffer Overflow', 'stack overflow'], 'impact': [\"['execute arbitrary commands'\", \"'denial-of-service attacks']\"], 'vector': 'malicious HTTP requests', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'TOTOLINK AC1200 Wireless Router A3002RU', 'version': 'V2.1.1-B20230720.1011', 'component': 'formWlEncrypt CGI handler'}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**Root Cause:**\\n- A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `setWlan` function within the `boa` web server binary. This function is responsible for handling the setting of the WLAN SSID.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `strcpy` function is used to copy the user-provided `wlan_ssid` into a fixed-size buffer `wlan_ssid_apmib` on the stack without proper bounds checking.\\n- **Lack of Input Validation:** While the web front-end has character count restrictions, these are not enforced on the backend, allowing an attacker to send a larger payload than the buffer can hold.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** By overflowing the stack buffer, an attacker can overwrite the return address and other saved registers. This allows them to redirect the program execution to an arbitrary address, which can be leveraged to execute shell commands by chaining gadgets.\\n- **Denial of Service:** If the attacker doesn't carefully craft their payload, the overflow can cause a crash, resulting in a denial of service.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted POST request to the `/boafrm/formWlEncrypt` endpoint.\\n- **`wlan_ssid` Parameter:** The `wlan_ssid` parameter within the POST data is the vehicle for injecting the overflow payload.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the router's web interface.\\n- **Authentication (Optional, but likely):** While not explicitly stated, it's implied that the attacker likely needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable functionality, however session id may be used as part of the request. The provided exploit includes steps to log into the router before triggering the vulnerability.\\n- **Knowledge of System:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the router's architecture, specifically the base address of `libuClibc-0.9.33.so` and the addresses of key functions within the library, such as `system` and a return address gadget. If using a simulated environment like FirmAE, ASLR needs to be disabled, and the base address must be identified.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats':

The formWlEncrypt CGI handler in the boa program **fails to limit the length of the wlan_ssid field from user input**. This allows attackers to craft malicious HTTP requests by supplying an excessively long value for the wlan_ssid field, leading to a **stack overflow**. This can be further exploited to execute arbitrary commands or launch denial-of-service attacks.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'fails to limit the length of the wlan_ssid field from user input'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
