        "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to have a valid user account and the ability to modify the password hash of the account to a malformed state. By default, only administrators can directly set a hashed password, but this can be enabled for regular users using the 'nsslapd-allow-hashed-passwords' configuration parameter."
