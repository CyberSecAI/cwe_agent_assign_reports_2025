# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-10838

## Vulnerability Description
An **integer underflow during deserialization** may allow any unauthenticated user to read out of bounds heap memory. This may result into secret data or pointers revealing the layout of the address space to be included into a deserialized data structure, which may potentially lead to thread crashes or cause denial of service conditions.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **integer underflow during deserialization**
- **impact:** read out of bounds heap memory and denial of service conditions and crash
- **attacker:** unauthenticated user

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2024-10838 based on provided content

The provided content is relevant to CVE-2024-10838. It details a security vulnerability in cyclonedds. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

An integer underflow during deserialization in `DDS_Security_Deserialize_OctetSeq` and `DDS_Security_Deserialize_String` allows reading out of bounds heap memory. The `a_size` calculation can exceed `seq->_length` and `dser->remain`, leading to an underflow in the subsequent subtraction and allowing the deserialization routine to consume data beyond the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Integer Underflow
*   Out-of-bounds (OOB) read

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Potential to read secret data (e.g., key material).
*   Potential to read the layout of the address space.
*   Potential for denial of service (crash the thread).

**Attack vectors:**

*   Network (Remote exploitation possible)
*   No authentication required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Unauthenticated user.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The vulnerability is patched in version 0.10.5.

**Additional details (more than official CVE description):**

*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) test case is provided, demonstrating the vulnerability.
*   The CVSS score is calculated as 8.6/10 (High severity).
*   CVSS v3 base metrics are provided: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H
*   The vulnerability is linked to CWE-191 (Integer Overflow or Underflow).
*   The reporter is credited as robertfemmer.
*   The issue is tracked as GHSA-6jj6-w25p-jc42 on GitHub.
