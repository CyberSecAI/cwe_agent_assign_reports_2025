## Vulnerability Description
The MSI installer for Splashtop Streamer for Windows before 3.6.2.0 uses a temporary folder with **weak permissions during installation**. A local user can exploit this to escalate privileges to SYSTEM by replacing InstRegExp.reg.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **weak permissions during installation**
- **impact:** escalate privileges to SYSTEM
- **vector:** replacing InstRegExp.reg
- **attacker:** local user
- **product:** Splashtop Streamer for Windows
- **version:** before 3.6.2.0
- **component:** MSI installer

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Splashtop Streamer MSI installer uses a temporary folder with weak permissions during installation, allowing a local authenticated user to manipulate the process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Weak permissions on the temporary folder used by the installer.
    - The installer loads a `.reg` file from a user-writable location in the `%TEMP%` directory.
    - The installer runs the `reg` load command in the `SYSTEM` context.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Privilege escalation to `SYSTEM`. An attacker can execute arbitrary code with `SYSTEM` privileges.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Local access to a system with Splashtop Streamer installed.
    - Re-triggering the installation process, either by keeping the original MSI or copying it back to its original execution location.
    - Manipulating the temporary folder by placing a malicious `.reg` file with a specific name, after deleting `SetupUtil.exe`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Local authenticated user access.
    - Ability to write files to the `%TEMP%` directory.
    - Ability to re-run the installation process.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| “Escalate to root/admin”                    | Privilege escalation impact           | Not CWE-269! Use root cause (e.g., 266, 250) |
| “Assigned wrong role/group”                 | Misassigned privilege                 | CWE-266                                      |
| “Runs as root” or “Should not run as admin” | Over-privileged execution             | CWE-250                                      |
| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
