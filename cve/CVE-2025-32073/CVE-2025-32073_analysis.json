It provides detailed information about the vulnerability, its resolution, and related discussions.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the `HTMLTags` extension returning the literal contents of the system message \"htmltags-notagname\", and the return value being interpreted as raw HTML. This allows for potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is an XSS issue.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nThe impact is not explicitly detailed beyond the potential for XSS, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a web page viewed by other users.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nThe attack vector involves manipulating the system message \"htmltags-notagname\" to include malicious HTML/JavaScript code.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\nThe content doesn't specify the exact privileges needed to manipulate the system message.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe vulnerability was fixed with the following Gerrit change: [https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/mediawiki/extensions/HTMLTags/+/1121056](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/mediawiki/extensions/HTMLTags/%2B/1121056)\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The task was initially created by BlankEclair on February 13, 2025.\n*   Yaron Koren was assigned to resolve the issue.\n*   The issue was closed as resolved on February 19, 2025.\n*   The task is associated with the MediaWiki extension \"HTMLTags\".\n*   There were discussions about creating a dedicated project tag for the extension to facilitate issue tracking.\n*   The task is linked to T382326, a task related to release announcements for security patches.",

CWE-79 has parent relationships to multiple more specific CWEs (CWE-87, CWE-86, CWE-85, CWE-84, CWE-83) which were not chosen because the description doesn't give the specifics required to select those. CWE-116 is a class-level CWE that can often be a contributing factor, so it is added as a secondary weakness, but it is less specific than CWE-79.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe116\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe116 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation**, which leads to **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**. The **improper input validation** is specifically the **improper neutralization** of input during web page generation (CWE-79). A secondary weakness might be **improper encoding or escaping of output** (CWE-116).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the **improper input validation** leads to **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**. The key phrase analysis further supports this. Given the direct evidence of **improper neutralization** leading to XSS, CWE-79 is the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nThe vulnerability description says \"Improper **Input Validation vulnerability** in The Wikimedia Foundation Mediawiki - HTML Tags allows **Cross-Site Scripting** (XSS).\" The key phrase ROOTCAUSE: 'Input Validation vulnerability' shows the top candidate CWEs are CWE-80, CWE-116 and CWE-79. The other keyphrases for WEAKNESS, IMPACT, VERSION, ROOTCAUSE all show the same top 3 candidate CWEs.\n\nCWE-79 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base), and there is no clear indication of a more specific variant being applicable. CWE-116 could be a contributing factor, but it's less specific than CWE-79 in this context.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
