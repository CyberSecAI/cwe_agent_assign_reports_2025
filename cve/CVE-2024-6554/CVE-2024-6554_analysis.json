  "description": "The Branda - White Label WordPress, Custom Login Page Customizer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.18. This is due the plugin utilizing composer without preventing direct access to the files. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6554:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability is due to the Branda WordPress plugin using composer without properly restricting direct access to its files. Specifically, it exposes a file (`prefix-fixer.php`) that reveals the full server path when accessed directly.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Full Path Disclosure:** The plugin exposes the full server path of the web application by allowing direct access to composer files. This is a form of information disclosure.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Limited Direct Impact:** The exposed information (full path) is not directly exploitable on its own. However, it can be used as an aid for other, more serious attacks. This can make it easier for attackers to target vulnerabilities that depend on knowledge of the file system structure.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Direct File Access:** Attackers can trigger the vulnerability by directly accessing a specific file (`prefix-fixer.php`) within the plugin's directory. This can likely be done through a web browser request.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to have an account on the target WordPress site.\n- **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable website.",

Given that the vulnerability specifically involves the disclosure of the full path, a more specific CWE might have been considered but was not in the provided list. Therefore, CWE-200 is the most appropriate given the details of the vulnerability. It is a Class level CWE, and there might be more specific Base level CWEs, however, they were not provided.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe200 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause** of using composer without restricting direct access to the files. This leads to the **weakness** of Full Path Disclosure, and the potential **impact** of aiding other attacks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the vulnerability as Full Path Disclosure, stemming from **improper** access control to composer files, leading to exposure of sensitive path information.\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 [Exposure of Sensitive Information] is based on the fact that the vulnerability description clearly states that the plugin exposes the full server path of the web application. The exposed information, while not directly exploitable on its own, can aid other attacks, which aligns with the description of CWE-200. While there might be more specific CWEs, the provided information supports CWE-200 as the most relevant.
