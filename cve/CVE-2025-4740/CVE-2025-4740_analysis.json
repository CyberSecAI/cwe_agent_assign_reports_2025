  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-4740 Content\n\nThe provided content is **RELATED** to a vulnerability and details are extracted below. It provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe `coef` script is vulnerable due to insecure deserialization. It uses `pickle.load()` to load data from the `coeficients.dat` file without any validation of the file's contents.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Insecure Deserialization: Specifically, using `pickle.load()` without proper input validation.\n*   Remote Code Execution (RCE): The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands, leading to potential system compromise. The example provided demonstrates launching `gnome-calculator`, but any OS command could be executed.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   File Replacement: An attacker can replace the `coeficients.dat` file with a malicious payload.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Write access to the `coeficients.dat` file or the ability to modify the file system where it resides.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not explicitly state a mitigation or fix, but the vulnerability description implies that avoiding `pickle.load()` with untrusted data or implementing robust input validation are necessary steps to address the issue.",
