- **product:** BeamCtrl Airiana
- **version:** up to 11.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-4740 Content

The provided content is **RELATED** to a vulnerability and details are extracted below. It provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `coef` script is vulnerable due to insecure deserialization. It uses `pickle.load()` to load data from the `coeficients.dat` file without any validation of the file's contents.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Insecure Deserialization: Specifically, using `pickle.load()` without proper input validation.
*   Remote Code Execution (RCE): The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands, leading to potential system compromise. The example provided demonstrates launching `gnome-calculator`, but any OS command could be executed.

**Attack vectors:**

*   File Replacement: An attacker can replace the `coeficients.dat` file with a malicious payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Write access to the `coeficients.dat` file or the ability to modify the file system where it resides.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not explicitly state a mitigation or fix, but the vulnerability description implies that avoiding `pickle.load()` with untrusted data or implementing robust input validation are necessary steps to address the issue.
