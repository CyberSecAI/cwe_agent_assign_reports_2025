While CWE-284 is a broader category, the vulnerability description explicitly states \"**Improper authorization**,\" making CWE-285 the more specific and appropriate choice. The \"Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance\" confirms that CWE-285 is suited for authorization flaws. CWE-285 is a Class level of abstraction, while several Base level children exist, none of them are specific enough.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper authorization**, leading to temporary access of sensitive information by physical attackers.\n\nImproper Authorization (Root Cause) -> Access to Sensitive Information (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly points to CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly uses the term \"**Improper authorization**,\" and the CVE reference links confirm this as the **root cause**. The impact is temporary access to sensitive information.\n\nAlthough CWE-285 is a Class and typically lower-level CWEs are preferred, none of the children of CWE-285 fit. The retriever results also list CWE-285 as a possibility.\n\nCWE-284 (Improper Access Control) was considered but is too broad. The evidence clearly indicates the problem is with authorization, not general access control.\n\nThe decision is primarily based on the explicit mention of \"**Improper authorization**\" in the vulnerability description and CVE summary. The \"Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance\" further supports this choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n**CWE-285: Improper Authorization**: The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.
