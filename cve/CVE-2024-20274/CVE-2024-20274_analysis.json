  "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software, formerly Firepower Management Center Software, could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary HTML content into a device-generated document. This vulnerability is due to **improper validation of user-supplied data**. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting malicious content to an affected device and using the device to generate a document that contains sensitive information. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the standard layout of the device-generated documents, access arbitrary files from the underlying operating system, and conduct **server-side request forgery** (SSRF) attacks. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid credentials for a user account with policy-editing permissions, such as Network Admin, Intrusion Admin, or any custom user role with the same capabilities.",

CWE-79 and CWE-918 are potential consequences of the **improper input validation**, and could potentially be chained after CWE-20, representing the path from root cause to impact.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe918 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe20\n    cwe79 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe918,cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (CWE-20). This leads to the ability to inject arbitrary HTML content (CWE-79) which can be used to alter the layout of documents and potentially conduct server-side request forgery (CWE-918). The chain represents the progression from root cause to impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nInitially, the description points to **improper validation of user-supplied data** as the root cause. The retriever results also highlight CWE-20 as a strong candidate. While CWE-20 is a Class-level CWE and is generally discouraged, the vulnerability description and CVE summary directly state **improper input validation** as the root cause. The documentation indicates the potential to inject arbitrary HTML (CWE-79) and conduct server-side request forgery (CWE-918). Therefore, CWE-20 is selected as the primary CWE due to its direct relevance to the root cause and the other CWEs are added as secondary candidates based on the impact description. The selection is heavily influenced by the explicit mention of **improper validation** in both the vulnerability description and the CVE summary, which is direct evidence supporting the choice of CWE-20.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
