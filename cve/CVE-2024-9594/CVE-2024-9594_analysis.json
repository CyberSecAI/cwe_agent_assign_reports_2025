  "description": "A security issue was discovered in the Kubernetes Image Builder versions <= v0.1.37 where default credentials are enabled during the image build process when using the Nutanix, OVA, QEMU or raw providers. The credentials can be used to gain root access. The credentials are disabled at the conclusion of the image build process. Kubernetes clusters are only affected if their nodes use VM images created via the Image Builder project. Because these images were vulnerable during the image build process, they are affected only if an attacker was able to reach the VM where the image build was happening and used the vulnerability to modify the image at the time the image build was occurring.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-9594:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The Kubernetes Image Builder, when used with Nutanix, OVA, QEMU, or raw providers, enabled default credentials during the image build process. These default credentials could be used to gain root access to the VM where the image build was occurring.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Default Credentials:** The primary weakness was the use of a predictable default password for the `builder` user during image creation.\n*   **Insecure Configuration:** The affected providers didn't have built-in support for randomly generated SSH keys/passwords which led to reliance on a default password.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Root Access:** Successful exploitation allowed an attacker to gain root access to the VM during the image build process.\n*   **Image Modification:** An attacker with root access could modify the image being built, potentially injecting malicious code or backdoors.\n*   **Compromised Kubernetes Nodes**: If the compromised images were later used to create Kubernetes nodes, these nodes would also be compromised, leading to potential cluster compromise.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network Access to Build VM:** The primary attack vector required the attacker to have network access to the VM where the image build process was taking place.\n*   **Timing Dependence:** The attacker needed to exploit the vulnerability during the short window when the default credentials were active (i.e., during the image building process).\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:**  The attacker must have network access to the build environment.\n*   **Privilege Escalation:** While not directly required by this CVE it was the impact, after exploiting the default password, the attacker gains root privileges.\n*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to exploit the default credentials while the image is actively being built.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was present in Kubernetes Image Builder versions v0.1.37 and earlier.\n*   The vulnerability was mitigated by generating a random SSH password for the `builder` account during the image build process. This was implemented in  Image Builder version v0.1.38 and also backported to the `master` branch.\n*   A temporary mitigation was suggested: disabling the `builder` account on affected VMs.\n*   The CVE has a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.3 (Medium), with a vector of `CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`.\n\n**In summary, CVE-2024-9594 is a medium-severity vulnerability that allowed attackers to gain root access to VMs during the image build process due to the use of default credentials in certain Kubernetes Image Builder providers. This vulnerability is mitigated by using a randomly generated password for the builder account.**",

While CWE-306 [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function] could apply, the evidence points more directly to the use of **default credentials** as the root cause. Therefore, CWE-1392 is chosen for its greater specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1392[\"CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe1392 -->|CHILDOF| cwe306\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1392 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of default credentials**, leading to potential unauthorized **root access**.\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Default credentials enabled** (CWE-1392)\n2.  **Impact:** Gain root access, potentially leading to modification of the image, and subsequent compromise of Kubernetes nodes.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis focuses on identifying the most accurate CWE for the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The description and CVE summary clearly indicate that the **default credentials** are the primary issue.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1392 [CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials] is based on the following evidence:\n\n*   The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section identifies \"**default credentials enabled**\" as the **rootcause**.\n*   The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" states: \"The primary weakness was the **use of a predictable default password** for the `builder` user during image creation.\"\n\nCWE-1392 [CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials] is a **Base** level CWE, which is preferred for mapping root causes. The MITRE mapping guidance for CWE-1392 [CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials] also states that its usage is \"Allowed.\"\n\nCWE-306 [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function] was considered, but ultimately not selected as the primary CWE, because the vulnerability isn't just about **missing** authentication, but specifically about the **use of default credentials**. The presence of **default credentials** implies that some form of authentication exists, albeit a weak and easily exploitable form.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe
