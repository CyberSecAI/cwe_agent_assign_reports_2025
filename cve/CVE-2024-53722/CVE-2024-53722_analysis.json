This can lead to the **Stored XSS** vulnerability, represented by **CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]**. The **CSRF** vulnerability occurs because the application does not sufficiently verify the request's origin. The **XSS** vulnerability results from the application's failure to neutralize user-controllable input before rendering it in a web page.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe79 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe352\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]** which allows malicious commands to be initiated by an attacker without the user's consent. Because of this vulnerability an attacker is able to inject malicious code that is stored by the server. This leads to the **CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]** vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a **Cross-Site Request Forgery** (CSRF) vulnerability leading to Stored **XSS**. The keyphrase analysis reinforces this, with **CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]** being the top candidate for the **CSRF** aspect, and **CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]** being a strong candidate for the **XSS** aspect.\n\nThe relationship analysis shows **CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]** can lead to other weaknesses, and the description states it leads to **Stored XSS**.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)]** and **CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]** is based on the evidence that the application does not properly validate requests, allowing for **CSRF**, and that user input is not neutralized, leading to stored **XSS**. These CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity (Compound and Base respectively).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.

It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 3095",
