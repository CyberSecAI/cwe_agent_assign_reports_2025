This includes the ability to execute code remotely with system privileges.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\nThe attack vector is remote and does not require any prior authentication.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\nThe attacker needs to be able to remotely access the device over the network. No special privileges are required before the exploitation.\n\n**Affected Products**\n- MB connect line mbNET.mini (<= 2.2.13)\n- Helmholz REX100 (<= 2.2.13)",

CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) and CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) are variants of CWE-798. CWE-1392 (Use of Default Credentials) is related to CWE-1391 (Use of Weak Credentials). The selection of CWE-798 as primary is based on the fact that the vulnerability description mentions hardcoded credentials (user accounts with hardcoded passwords).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe1392[\"CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n    \n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe1392 -->|CHILDOF| cwe1391\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe798 primary\n    class cwe259,cwe1392 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **hardcoded user accounts with hardcoded passwords** (CWE-798). This leads to an unauthenticated remote attacker gaining full control of the affected devices, thus achieving remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly states the presence of **hardcoded user accounts with hardcoded passwords**. This maps directly to CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials).\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"The devices contain two **hard coded user accounts with hardcoded passwords** that allow an unauthenticated remote attacker for full control of the affected devices.\" The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also mentions: \"The vulnerability stems from the presence of two **hardcoded user accounts with hardcoded passwords** within the affected devices.\"\n\nCWE-798 is chosen as the primary CWE because it directly reflects the root cause: the use of hardcoded credentials. While CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) is a more specific variant, the description mentions both user accounts and passwords, making CWE-798 a more accurate representation. CWE-1392 (Use of Default Credentials) could also be a secondary candidate, but \"hardcoded\" is more precise than \"default\" in this case.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately describe the **root cause** of the vulnerability without being overly specific or general.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.82\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Explanation**: This CWE directly matches the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the presence of **hard-coded credentials**.\n\n## CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a **hard-coded password**, which it uses for its own inbound authentication or for outbound communication to external components.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Explanation**: This is a more specific variant of CWE-798, focusing specifically on **hard-coded passwords**. Since the vulnerability involves both user accounts and passwords, CWE-798 is a slightly better fit as the primary.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or **hard-coded password**) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Explanation**: This CWE is too general, as it encompasses various types of weak credentials, not just **hard-coded ones**.\n\n## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe use of a **hard-coded cryptographic key** significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Explanation**: This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability description does not specifically mention cryptographic keys.\n\n## CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses **default credentials** (such as passwords or cryptographic keys) for potentially critical functionality.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Explanation**: Although the credentials are hardcoded, they could be considered defaults.
