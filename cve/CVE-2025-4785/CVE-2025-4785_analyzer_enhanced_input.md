## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-4785 related content

The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the phpgurukul Daily Expense Tracker Project V1.1, specifically in the `/user-profile.php` file.  It appears as two separate issue reports (#9 and #10) on a GitHub repository, both authored by the same user (f1rstb100d). While both target the same file, they identify different vulnerable parameters.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information, extracted from both reports:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input before it's used in SQL queries. Specifically, the `fullname` parameter (in issue #9) and the `contactnumber` parameter (in issue #10) are vulnerable. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through these parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized access to the database.
*   Sensitive data leakage.
*   Data tampering.
*   Complete system control.
*   Service disruption.

**Attack vectors:**

*   HTTP POST requests to `/dets/user-profile.php` with malicious payloads in the `fullname` or `contactnumber` parameters.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.
*   Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Employ prepared statements and parameter binding:** This is the primary recommended mitigation.
*   **Conduct input validation and filtering:**  Ensure user input conforms to expected formats.
*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Limit the privileges of the database account used by the application.

**Payload Examples:**

*   **Issue #9 (fullname parameter):** `fullname=Test User' RLIKE SLEEP(5)-- WXTw&email=testuser@gmail.com&contactnumber=1233211230&regdate=2024-08-16 13:17:22&submit=`
*   **Issue #10 (contactnumber parameter):** `fullname=Test User&email=testuser@gmail.com&contactnumber=1233211230' AND 6067=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (6067=6067) THEN 6067 ELSE (SELECT 3370 UNION SELECT 7238) END))-- -&regdate=2024-08-16 13:17:22&submit=`

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The reports include example HTTP request packets demonstrating the vulnerability.
*   They also mention the use of the `sqlmap` tool for testing and provide screenshots of its output.
*   Specific payload examples for both time-based blind and boolean-based blind SQL injection are provided.
*   The reports specify the affected software version (V1.1) and provide a link to download the software.

**Note:** The content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description would, including specific payloads, request examples, and tool output.
