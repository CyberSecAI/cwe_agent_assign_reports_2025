# Analysis for CVE-2024-50699

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1392 | Use of Default Credentials | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-257 | Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship identified is that **CWE-1392 (Use of Default Credentials)** is a base-level CWE, directly reflecting the **root cause** of the vulnerability. While other CWEs like **CWE-1391 (Use of Weak Credentials)** are related, **CWE-1392** provides a more direct and accurate classification. **CWE-257 (Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format)** is considered as a secondary CWE because the reference link mentions that the credentials were transmitted insecurely in older versions of the firmware.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with the **use of default credentials (CWE-1392)**. This allows attackers to potentially gain unauthorized access to the router. Older firmware versions use **insecure credential transmission (CWE-257)**, further weakening security. The re-use of credentials after upgrade maintains the vulnerability. The final impact is full admin access, leading to potential network compromise.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability, which is the **use of default credentials**. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly supports this classification. The reference link specifies that the credentials were transmitted insecurely in older versions of the firmware which led to selecting **CWE-257 (Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format)** as a secondary CWE.

The selection of **CWE-1392 (Use of Default Credentials)** is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description, which states "TP-Link... were discovered to contain **weak default credentials** for the Administrator account." This aligns perfectly with the definition of **CWE-1392**: "The product uses default credentials (such as passwords or cryptographic keys) for potentially critical functionality." The CWE is at the base level of abstraction, which is appropriate for this vulnerability.

**Description**:
The product uses default credentials (such as passwords or cryptographic keys) for potentially critical functionality.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate
