The description clearly states that an attacker with physical access can access contacts from the lock screen. The retriever results suggested several CWEs, including CWE-285 (**Improper Authorization**) and CWE-1263 (**Improper Physical Access Control**).\n\nThe evidence supporting CWE-285 is the description \"An attacker with physical access may be able to access contacts from the lock screen\". This implies that the lock screen's authorization mechanism is **improperly** implemented or bypassed. Since the description mentions \"improved checks\" as the fix, it further strengthens the argument that there was an initial **lack of proper authorization**.\n\nCWE-1263 is included because the attacker requires \"physical access\" to exploit the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-20 (**Improper Input Validation**) was considered but discarded because the issue appears to be related to authorization rather than input validation. Similarly, CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**) and CWE-120 (**Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')**) were deemed irrelevant as there is no mention of memory corruption or buffer overflows.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-285 as the primary CWE is based on the evidence of **improper authorization** leading to unauthorized access. This aligns with the CWE's description and the provided fix (\"improved checks\"). The level of specificity is appropriate given the available information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1263: Improper Physical Access Control\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is designed with access restricted to certain information, but it does not sufficiently protect against an unauthorized actor with physical access to these areas.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-285: Improper Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 493.19\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead.
