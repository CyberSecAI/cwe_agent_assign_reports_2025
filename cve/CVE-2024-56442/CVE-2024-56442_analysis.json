CWE-771 does not have defined relationships to other CWEs in the provided data. CWE-770 is related to CWE-400 (Resource Exhaustion) and can precede CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation). CWE-285 is a Class level CWE and is therefore less specific than CWE-771 and CWE-770.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe771[\"CWE-771: Missing Reference to Active Allocated Resource\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Resource Exhaustion\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe20\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe771 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing implementation of native APIs** in the NFC service module (CWE-771). This **missing implementation** could lead to improper resource allocation (CWE-770), which could then lead to abnormal feature performance. Alternatively, the **missing implementation** could result in the system not properly authorizing actions (CWE-285).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, especially the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\", which states: \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** Vulnerability of native APIs not being implemented in the NFC service module.\" This statement directly supports the selection of CWE-771 (Missing Reference to Active Allocated Resource) as the primary CWE, because a **missing** API indicates a **missing** resource.\n\nCWE-771 is the most specific and appropriate CWE based on the available information. The other considered CWEs (CWE-770, CWE-285) represent possible consequences or related weaknesses but are not the direct root cause.\n\nCWE-770 could be present if the **missing** API implementation results in resources not being properly managed, but this is a secondary consideration.\n\nCWE-285 could be present if the **missing** API implementation results in improper authorization, but this is also a secondary consideration.\n\nThe selection of CWE-771 as the primary weakness is based on the evidence explicitly stating a **missing implementation**.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
