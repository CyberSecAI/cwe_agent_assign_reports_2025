  "description": "GLPI is a free asset and IT management software package. Starting in version 0.71 and prior to version 10.0.18, an anonymous user can fetch sensitive information from the `status.php` endpoint. Version 10.0.18 contains a fix for the issue. Some workarounds are available. One may delete the `status.php` file, restrict its access, or remove any sensitive values from the `name` field of the active LDAP directories, mail servers authentication providers and mail receivers.",

Although other CWEs related to authentication and authorization were considered, the core issue is the disclosure of sensitive data without proper access controls being in place. CWE-306 was considered as a secondary issue, since the endpoint was accessible without authentication.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** (CWE-306) for the `status.php` endpoint, leading to the **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200) to anonymous users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary weakness is the **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200) because an anonymous user can fetch sensitive information from the `status.php` endpoint. This is a direct match for the vulnerability description. The secondary weakness is the **missing authentication** (CWE-306) for the `status.php` endpoint, which allows anonymous access and contributes to the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 is based on the fact that the endpoint `status.php` leaks sensitive data. The retriever results also support this by identifying CWE-200 as highly relevant.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially
