## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved Revert ALSA firewire-lib operate for period elapse event in process context Commit 7ba5ca32fe6e (ALSA firewire-lib operate for period elapse event in process context) removed the process context workqueue from amdtp_domain_stream_pcm_pointer() and update_pcm_pointers() to remove its overhead. With RME Fireface 800, this lead to a regression since Kernels 5.14.0, causing an **AB/BA deadlock competition** for the substream lock with eventual system freeze under ALSA operation thread 0 * (lock A) acquire substream lock by snd_pcm_stream_lock_irq() in snd_pcm_status64() * (lock B) wait for tasklet to finish by calling tasklet_unlock_spin_wait() in tasklet_disable_in_atomic() in ohci_flush_iso_completions() of ohci.c thread 1 * (lock B) enter tasklet * (lock A) attempt to acquire substream lock, waiting for it to be released snd_pcm_stream_lock_irqsave() in snd_pcm_period_elapsed() in update_pcm_pointers() in process_ctx_payloads() in process_rx_packets() of amdtp-stream.c ? tasklet_unlock_spin_wait ohci_flush_iso_completions firewire_ohci amdtp_domain_stream_pcm_pointer snd_firewire_lib snd_pcm_update_hw_ptr0 snd_pcm snd_pcm_status64 snd_pcm ? native_queued_spin_lock_slowpath _raw_spin_lock_irqsave snd_pcm_period_elapsed snd_pcm process_rx_packets snd_firewire_lib irq_target_callback snd_firewire_lib handle_it_packet firewire_ohci context_t

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to a regression in the Linux kernel's ALSA firewire-lib, which is a direct result of commit 7ba5ca32fe6e. This commit removed the process context workqueue which led to a deadlock situation on certain hardware. This regression and subsequent fix are not mentioned in the description provided for CVE-2024-42274, but the content seems relevant.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the removal of a process context workqueue in commit 7ba5ca32fe6e, which was intended to reduce overhead but introduced a deadlock in specific scenarios. The lack of this workqueue resulted in a race condition when accessing the substream lock.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a deadlock condition caused by a race condition between different threads trying to acquire the same lock in different contexts (process context and tasklet context). Specifically, there is a lock ordering issue when an attempt to acquire the ALSA substream lock is made from both the `snd_pcm_status64()` function running in a process context and from `snd_pcm_period_elapsed()` running within a tasklet context.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of exploitation is a system freeze. The deadlock prevents the system from progressing, leading to a complete halt of the ALSA audio subsystem and eventually the entire system.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves using the ALSA subsystem with a specific hardware configuration (RME Fireface 800). The specific operations within the ALSA subsystem, particularly around handling period elapsed events, trigger the deadlock. The attack is not remote; it requires local access to the vulnerable system and usage of the sound subsystem.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to trigger ALSA audio operations on a system running a vulnerable kernel and using a Fireface 800 audio device. This means they would need a user account with the necessary permissions to interact with the audio subsystem.

**More details:**
The provided content details the exact sequence of operations that lead to the deadlock. It outlines the following:
1.  Thread 0 acquires the substream lock using `snd_pcm_stream_lock_irq()` within `snd_pcm_status64()`. Then it waits for a tasklet to finish using `tasklet_unlock_spin_wait()` within `ohci_flush_iso_completions()`.
2.  Thread 1, a tasklet, attempts to acquire the same substream lock using `snd_pcm_stream_lock_irqsave()` within `snd_pcm_period_elapsed()`.
This causes an AB/BA deadlock. The provided information also includes the call stack of the processes and interrupt that are involved in the deadlock.
The fix is to revert the problematic commit and restore the process context workqueue to handle the period elapsed event.

The content provides more details regarding the specific scenario in which the vulnerability manifests. It explains the exact locking issue leading to the deadlock.
