### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **lacks CSRF checks**
- **impact:** invite any user to any group
- **attacker:** user

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The Himer theme lacks Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) checks when processing requests to invite users to groups. This allows an attacker to force a logged-in user to unknowingly perform actions that they did not intend.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CSRF vulnerability:** The theme's `wpqa_add_group_user` AJAX action does not include proper CSRF protection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A logged-in user can be tricked into inviting any user to any group, including private groups, without their consent or knowledge. This could lead to unauthorized access to private group content, unwanted group membership, and potentially other forms of social engineering.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTML page that includes a form that auto-submits a request to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint when the logged-in victim visits the malicious page. This bypasses the theme's intended user authorization, and performs an unauthorized action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in victim to open a malicious HTML page. The victim must be logged into the vulnerable WordPress site at the time of the attack. The attacker does not need to be authenticated or authorized.
