A possible secondary CWE is CWE-312 (**CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information**), as the password was stored or made available in cleartext. CWE-201 is a parent of CWE-598, and has peer relationships with CWE-202 and CWE-209. These relationships were not directly relevant in selecting the CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe312 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insertion of sensitive information into sent data** (CWE-201), leading to the retrieval of the password in cleartext. The password being available in cleartext may also imply **cleartext storage of sensitive information** (CWE-312).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the description provided, which highlights that the administrative account password can be retrieved in cleartext due to the **insertion of sensitive information into sent data**. The Retriever Results also list CWE-201 (**CWE-201 Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data**) as a top candidate. The evidence \"The vulnerability is due to the insertion of sensitive information (cleartext password) into sent data\" directly supports the selection of CWE-201 as the primary weakness.\n\nCWE-312 (**CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information**) was considered as a secondary weakness, as the password was ultimately made available in cleartext.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they are base level CWEs that accurately describe the root cause and a contributing factor to the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
