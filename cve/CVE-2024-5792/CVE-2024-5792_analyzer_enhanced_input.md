## Vulnerability Description
The Houzez CRM plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the notes belong_to parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.2 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Custom-level (seller) access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.
