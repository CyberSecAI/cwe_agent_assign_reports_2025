# Analysis for CVE-2024-7715

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-134 | Use of Externally-Controlled Format String | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the parent-child relationship between CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')) and CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')). Given that the command injection directly involves OS commands, the more specific CWE-78 was selected. CWE-134 (Use of Externally-Controlled Format String) was also considered because the vulnerability occurs due to the usage of `sprintf`.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper sanitization** of the `filter` argument. This leads to the use of this unsanitized data in a `sprintf` function, which then executes a command via `system`. This is a classic **command injection** scenario.

1.  **Improper Input Validation** (implicit): The `filter` argument is not properly validated.
2.  **CWE-134 Use of Externally-Controlled Format String**: The `sprintf` function is vulnerable to format string bugs because the input is not sanitized.
3.  **CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')**: The `system` command executes the injected command.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary vulnerability is **command injection** (CWE-78). The `filter` parameter isn't sanitized, leading to the injection. The use of `sprintf` without proper sanitization contributes to the vulnerability. The retriever results and the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" clearly indicate **command injection**. The evidence provided is sufficient to confidently assign CWE-78.

The analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description and the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary". The description explicitly states "**command injection**" and the summary details how the `filter` argument is passed unsanitized to `sprintf` and then to the `system` command.

CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')) was considered but not selected as the primary CWE because CWE-78 is more specific to OS commands, and the vulnerability involves injecting OS commands.

CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) was considered but not selected because it is too high-level. The specific weakness is the **improper neutralization** of special elements, making CWE-78 a more appropriate choice.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.



## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
