Other CWEs (CWE-798, CWE-259, CWE-79, CWE-78, CWE-73, CWE-22, CWE-319, CWE-1392) are present in the CVE reference links summary but are not directly indicated in the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe611[\"CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference\"]\n    cwe776[\"CWE-776: Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation\"]\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe1392[\"CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe776 -->|PEEROF| cwe611\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe611 primary\n    class cwe776,cwe798,cwe259,cwe79,cwe78,cwe73,cwe22,cwe319,cwe1392 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **XML parsing library being used** without proper restrictions, leading to a **time-based blind XML External Entity (XXE)** vulnerability.
