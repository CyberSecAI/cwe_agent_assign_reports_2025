## Vulnerability Description
Toshiba printers use XML communication for the API endpoint provided by the printer. For the endpoint, **XML parsing library is used** and it is vulnerable to a **time-based blind XML External Entity (XXE)** vulnerability. An attacker can DoS the printers. An attacker can exploit the XXE to retrieve information. As for the affected products/models/versions, see the reference URL.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **XML parsing library is used**
- **weakness:** **time-based blind XML External Entity (XXE)**
- **impact:** retrieve information and DoS
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Toshiba printers
- **component:** API endpoint XML parsing library
