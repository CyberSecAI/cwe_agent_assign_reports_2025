# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2025-2690

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-502 | Deserialization of Untrusted Data | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-502, stands alone as the root cause. No hierarchical, chain, or peer relationships significantly influence the selection, as the vulnerability description focuses solely on the deserialization aspect.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain consists of a single point: **deserialization** of untrusted data (CWE-502), which leads directly to potential remote code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which clearly states that the vulnerability is related to **deserialization**. The phrase "manipulation leads to **deserialization**" directly points to CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data). The retriever results also list CWE-502 as a potential candidate.

The confidence score is high (1.0) because the provided description explicitly mentions **deserialization** as the root cause.

The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the weakness described in the vulnerability.
