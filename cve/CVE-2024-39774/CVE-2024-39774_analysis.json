  "reference_content": "## CVE-2024-39774 - Wavlink AC3000 adm.cgi set_sys_adm() buffer overflow vulnerability\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nA buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to a lack of length checks when copying data into a stack buffer using `sprintf` in the `set_sys_adm` function of the `adm.cgi` file. Specifically, the `new_pwd` POST parameter is copied without size validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   CWE-120 - Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input (\u2018Classic Buffer Overflow\u2019)\n*   Stack-based buffer overflow\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation allows an attacker to overwrite the return address of the function, leading to code execution. This can result in high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CVSSv3 score: 9.1).\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `adm.cgi` script with a large `new_pwd` parameter.\n*   Requires authenticated access (PR:H - Privileges Required: High).\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Authenticated user with the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe report does not specify a fix, but implies that proper bounds checking on input data before copying it into fixed-size buffers is necessary to prevent the vulnerability. The vendor was contacted and acknowledged the issue, but the product has been discontinued. Patches were being worked on at the time of the report.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **Vulnerable Product:** Wavlink AC3000 M33A8.V5030.210505\n*   **Vulnerable Function:** `set_sys_adm` in `adm.cgi`\n*   The router uses lighttpd, and .cgi files are located in the web root.\n*   The `check_valid_user()` function is used for authentication, checking the `session` cookie.\n*   The vulnerability is triggered when the `page=sysAdm` parameter is used in the HTTP POST request.\n*   The `sprintf` function at offsets [2] and [3] are vulnerable.\n*   Crash information and a GDB backtrace are provided.\n*   Timeline of vendor communication is included.\n*   Discovered by Lilith >\\_> of Cisco Talos.",

CWE-120 can precede CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) as part of a vulnerability chain. The selection of CWE-121 as the primary CWE is based on its specific identification of a stack-based buffer overflow, making it a more precise match than its parent class.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe121\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe120 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **improper** data handling (CWE-120), which leads to a **stack-based buffer overflow** (CWE-121). The root cause is the **lack of size checking** when copying the `new_pwd` parameter. This leads to overwriting of the stack, which allows for code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the vulnerability description and the provided CVE reference. The vulnerability is specifically identified as a **stack-based buffer overflow** in the `adm.cgi` `set_sys_adm()` functionality of Wavlink AC3000. The root cause is identified as the **lack of length checks** when copying data into a stack buffer using `sprintf`.\n\nThe selection of CWE-121 is based on its precise description of a **stack-based buffer overflow**, which directly matches the vulnerability. The CVE reference also mentions CWE-120, which describes the **buffer copy without checking size**, which is the mechanism that led to the overflow.\n\nCWE-119 was considered but not chosen as the primary CWE because it is a more general class. CWE-121, being a variant, provides a more specific description of the vulnerability. The retriever results also indicated that CWE-121 and CWE-120 are relevant, further supporting the choice of these CWEs. The evidence is strong, and the selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary.
