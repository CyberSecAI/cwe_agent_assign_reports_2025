  "description": "A vulnerability classified as critical has been found in libzvbi up to 0.2.43. This affects the function vbi_capture_sim_load_caption of the file src/io-sim.c. The manipulation leads to **integer overflow**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 0.2.44 is able to address this issue. The identifier of the patch is ca1672134b3e2962cd392212c73f44f8f4cb489f. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component. The code maintainer was informed beforehand about the issues. She reacted very fast and highly professional.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-2176 based on provided content\n\nThe provided content relates to CVE-2025-2176. It details security vulnerabilities in the ZVBI library, specifically addressing integer overflows that can lead to heap overflows. Here's a breakdown of the information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nInteger overflows in several functions (`vbi_strlen_ucs2`, `strndup_identity`, `strndup_utf8_ucs2`, `vbi_search_new`, `extend_buffer`, `vbi_capture_sim_load_caption`) within the `libzvbi` library. These overflows occur when calculating buffer sizes, potentially leading to heap overflows.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **CWE-190:** Integer Overflow\n*   **CWE-824:** Heap buffer overflow\n*   **CWE-908:** Integer overflow leading to buffer over-read/write\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nThe impact ranges from crashing the application to a Denial of Service (DoS), and potentially more severe consequences due to the heap overflows.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nThe content doesn't explicitly detail attack vectors, but the vulnerabilities are triggered by integer overflows during buffer allocation and string handling. An attacker could potentially craft input that causes these overflows, leading to exploitation.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\nThe attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `libzvbi` library that triggers the integer overflows. This could be through processing specific data formats that the library handles.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe vulnerabilities have been patched in version 0.2.44 of the library. The fix involves adding checks to prevent integer overflows when calculating buffer sizes before allocation. The commit ca16721 implements these fixes.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The content provides specific file names and functions affected by the vulnerabilities (`src/conv.c`, `src/io-sim.c`, `src/search.c`).\n*   It shows code diffs demonstrating the changes made to mitigate the vulnerabilities.\n*   It mentions the use of `vbi_malloc` for memory allocation and the addition of checks before calling this function.\n*   It highlights that the release 0.2.44 contains the security patches.\n*   The commit is signed with a verified signature.\n*   The content also mentions the use of `extend_buffer` function and the addition of checks before calling it.\n*   The content also mentions that the original code had a copyright by I\u00f1aki G. Etxebarria.",

Also, **CWE-190** is a **CHILDOF** **CWE-20** Improper Input Validation. The integer overflow is the root cause, leading to a buffer overflow as a consequence.

The retriever results also strongly suggest **CWE-190** Integer Overflow or Wraparound as the primary weakness. The relationship analysis confirms that **CWE-190** can lead to buffer overflows.
