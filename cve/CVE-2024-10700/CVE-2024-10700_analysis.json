  "description": "A vulnerability was found in code-projects University Event Management System 1.0. It has been declared as critical. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file submit.php. The manipulation of the argument name/email/title/Year/gender/fromdate/todate/people leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The initial researcher advisory only mentions the parameter name to be affected. But it must be assumed that a variety of other parameters is affected too.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `submit.php` file of the University Event Management System. This vulnerability arises from the lack of proper sanitization or parameterization of user-supplied input in the `name` parameter when constructing SQL queries.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input from the `name` parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.\n*   **Unauthenticated access:** The vulnerability is accessible without prior authentication.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other confidential data. The provided proof of concept (POC) demonstrates retrieving the current user information from the database.\n*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could also potentially modify or delete data within the database, leading to data corruption or loss.\n*   **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database user privileges, an attacker could potentially escalate their privileges within the database or potentially the system.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Remote Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network because the vulnerable script (`submit.php`) is accessible via HTTP.\n*   **HTTP Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request to `submit.php` with a crafted `name` parameter that contains SQL injection payload.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.\n*   **Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payload.\n*   **No Authentication:** No prior authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The provided proof of concept uses `sqlmap`, a popular SQL injection testing tool, to demonstrate the vulnerability.\n*   The application version affected is \"php and v1\".\n\nThis information provides a more detailed understanding of the vulnerability compared to a placeholder CVE description.",

CWE-352 was not selected because it relates to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and that is not indicated in the vulnerability description. CWE-1391 was not selected since there is no mention of weak credentials. CWE-99 was not selected because the vulnerability does not directly involve the improper control of resource identifiers. CWE-78 was not selected because the vulnerability relates to SQL commands, not OS commands. CWE-472 and CWE-73 were not selected because the vulnerability does not involve external control of assumed-immutable web parameters or external control of file names or paths, respectively.
