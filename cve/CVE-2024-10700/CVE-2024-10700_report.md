A vulnerability was found in code-projects University Event Management System 1.0. It has been declared as critical. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file submit.php. The manipulation of the argument name/email/title/Year/gender/fromdate/todate/people leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The initial researcher advisory only mentions the parameter name to be affected. But it must be assumed that a variety of other parameters is affected too.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Weakness:** sql injection
- **Product:** code-projects University Event Management System
- **Version:** 1
- **Component:** submit.php

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship considered was the direct match of the vulnerability description to the definition and examples of CWE-89. The retriever results strongly supported this selection. No other relationships significantly influenced the decision.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is simple: **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command** leads directly to SQL Injection, allowing for database compromise.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based strongly on the evidence provided within the vulnerability description, which clearly states the presence of **SQL Injection** due to the **improper neutralization** of input. The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" confirms this by highlighting the lack of proper sanitization of the `name` parameter when constructing SQL queries.

The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the most appropriate mapping. The evidence is direct and compelling, leading to high confidence in the assessment.

CWE-79, CWE-434, CWE-1336, CWE-352, CWE-1391, CWE-99, CWE-78, CWE-472, and CWE-73 were considered but not selected. CWE-79 was not selected because the vulnerability is specifically related to SQL injection, not cross-site scripting. CWE-434 was not selected because it relates to unrestricted file uploads, which is not mentioned in the description. CWE-1336 was not selected since the vulnerability doesn't use a template engine. CWE-352 was not selected because it relates to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and that is not indicated in the vulnerability description. CWE-1391 was not selected since there is no mention of weak credentials. CWE-99 was not selected because the vulnerability does not directly involve the improper control of resource identifiers. CWE-78 was not selected because the vulnerability relates to SQL commands, not OS commands. CWE-472 and CWE-73 were not selected because the vulnerability does not involve external control of assumed-immutable web parameters or external control of file names or paths, respectively. All of these other candidates were less specific and less relevant than CWE-89.
