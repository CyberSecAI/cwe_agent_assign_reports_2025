While some child CWEs might offer more specific classifications in other scenarios, the lack of detailed information about the specific mechanism of **improper handling of request data** makes CWE-200 the most appropriate choice. The abstraction level is a Class which is less than ideal, but the information provided does not offer the ability to select a more specific Base or Variant.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper handling of request data**, which leads to the exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized actors.\n  - Root cause: **Improper handling of request data**\n  - Impact: Information Disclosure\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **improper handling of request data**. The vulnerability description clearly states that this leads to an information disclosure. The retriever results strongly suggest CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) as a potential candidate.\n\nThe decision to use CWE-200 is based on the vulnerability description stating that the **improper handling of request data** in HCL Connections, due to an IBM WebSphere Application Server error, leads to a user obtaining sensitive information they are not entitled to.\n\nCWE-200 is selected because the description aligns well with the stated outcome of the vulnerability. While CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE, the information is not specific enough to select a more specific Base or Variant.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
