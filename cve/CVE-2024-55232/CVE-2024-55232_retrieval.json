This flaw enables attackers to delete another users information.', key_phrases={'rootcause': ['IDOR', 'missing authorization checks'], 'weakness': '', 'impact': 'delete notes belonging to other accounts', 'vector': '', 'attacker': 'unauthorized users', 'product': 'PHPGurukul Online Notes Sharing Management System', 'version': 'v1.0', 'component': 'manage-notes.php module'}, reference_content=\"Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-55232\\n\\n**Description:**\\nAn Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `manage-notes.php` module of PHPGurukul Online Notes Sharing Management System v1.0. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to delete notes belonging to other accounts due to missing authorization checks.\\n\\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\\nThe application lacks proper authorization checks when handling note deletion requests. This means that an attacker can manipulate the `delid` parameter in the URL to delete notes associated with another user's account without having the necessary permissions.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\\n\\n*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The system directly uses the note ID provided in the request parameter (`delid`) to identify the note to be deleted without verifying if the logged-in user is authorized to delete that specific note.\\n*   **Missing Authorization Checks:** There are no checks to confirm that the user making the delete request is the owner of the note.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\nSuccessful exploitation allows an attacker to delete notes belonging to other users. This can lead to:\\n    *   **Data Loss:** Users may lose valuable information stored as notes.\\n    *   **Service Disruption:**  The application's functionality is impacted as user's ability to store their notes is not available.\\n    *   **Loss of Integrity:** The attacker can arbitrarily alter the system's data.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n\\n*   **Direct URL Manipulation:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by modifying the `delid` parameter in the URL request.\\n*   **Captured Delete Links:** The attacker could also capture a delete link associated with a victim's account, such as by social engineering or by inspecting network traffic, and use it to exploit the vulnerability.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n\\n*   **Valid User Account:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account in the system.\\n*   **Knowledge of Target Note ID:** The attacker needs to know the note ID (`delid`) of the note they want to delete. This could be obtained through social engineering, prior access to a victim's account or, more likely, by observing the id's of the notes they themselves have created, allowing the attacker to try other id's.\\n\\n**PoC:**\\nThe provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the attack:\\n1.  Attacker logs in with their account (e.g., `hacker@gmail.com`).\\n2.  Attacker gains access to a delete link associated with a victim's account (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1/user/manage-notes.php?delid=20`).\\n3.  While still logged in as the attacker, they modify the `delid` parameter in the link (if needed) and submit the request.\\n4.  When the victim (e.g., `victim@gmail.com`) logs back in, it is confirmed that their note with ID 20 has been deleted by the attacker.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '',
