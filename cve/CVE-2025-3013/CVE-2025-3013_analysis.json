The application's authorization mechanism allows unauthorized access to resources by modifying a key controlled by the user. |\n| CWE-425 | Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The application fails to enforce proper authorization, allowing direct access to restricted resources. |\n| CWE-285 | Improper Authorization | 0.5 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. The application does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-639, Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key, which is a Base level CWE. This selection is based on the vulnerability description that an attacker can gain access by manipulating request parameters or object references, which are essentially user-controlled keys.\nCWE-425, Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'), is a potential secondary CWE because it highlights the lack of proper authorization enforcement. It is a ChildOf CWE-288, Authentication Bypass.\nCWE-285, Improper Authorization is a Class-level CWE and is a parent of CWE-862, Missing Authorization and CWE-863, Incorrect Authorization. I considered those CWEs, but there was not enough information to specify whether the authorization was missing or incorrect.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe425,cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Insecure Direct Object References**, where request parameters or object references are manipulated by an attacker. This leads to an authorization bypass, allowing the attacker to gain unauthorized access to resources.\nRoot Cause: **Insecure Direct Object References** (IDOR)\nWeakness: Authorization Bypass\nImpact: Unauthorized Access\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description, which indicates an **Insecure Direct Object References** (IDOR) vulnerability. The key phrase \"**manipulating request parameters or object references**\" directly supports the selection of CWE-639, as it highlights the use of user-controlled keys to bypass authorization. The description also suggests a lack of proper authorization enforcement, making CWE-425 a relevant secondary consideration.\nI considered alternate CWEs from the retriever results. CWE-99, Improper Control of Resource Identifiers ('Resource Injection') was considered. However, since the description specifically mentions \"manipulating request parameters or object references,\" CWE-639 is more precise. The mapping guidance for CWE-639 (Usage: Allowed, Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.) confirms it to be a suitable choice.\nCWE-425 was chosen as a secondary weakness because the **rootcause** is the **Insecure Direct Object References** but also could be construed as the web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\nCWE-285 was considered because it could be construed as the product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.",
