It has child relationships with CWE-333 and CWE-332. It is also a child of CWE-330 **Use of Insufficiently Random Values**, which is a class level CWE. The **insufficient entropy** leads to the **insecure AES key**. CWE-321 **Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key** is a variant and child of CWE-798 and peer of CWE-257.

This, in turn, allows attackers to decrypt intercepted communications.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary focus of this vulnerability is the **insufficient entropy** used in generating the AES key. The vulnerability description clearly states that the SunGrow iSolarCloud Android app uses an **insecure AES key** due to **insufficient entropy**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this, stating the **root cause** as the use of an insecure AES encryption key with **insufficient entropy**.\n\nCWE-331 **Insufficient Entropy** is the most appropriate primary CWE because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The key used is not sufficiently random, making it easier to compromise. This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-331.\n\nCWE-321 **Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key** is a possible secondary CWE, because an insecure key may have been hardcoded somewhere, but the primary issue is the **lack of entropy**.\n\nCWE-338 **Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)** is also considered because the insufficient entropy may arise from the use of a weak PRNG.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-330 **Use of Insufficiently Random Values**, however since **insufficient entropy** is called out specifically, it is more appropriate to choose the Base CWE-331.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
