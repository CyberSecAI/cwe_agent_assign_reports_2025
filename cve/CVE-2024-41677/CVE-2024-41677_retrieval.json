  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-41677', description='Qwik is a performance focused javascript framework. A potential mutation **XSS vulnerability** exists in Qwik for versions up to but not including 1.6.0. Qwik improperly escapes HTML on server-side rendering. It converts strings according to the rules found in the `render-ssr.ts` file. It sometimes causes the situation that the final DOM tree rendered on browsers is different from what Qwik expects on server-side rendering. This may be leveraged to perform XSS attacks, and a type of the XSS is known as mXSS (mutation XSS). This has been resolved in qwik version 1.6.0 and @builder.io/qwik version 1.7.3. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'improper HTML escaping', 'weakness': ['XSS vulnerability', 'cross-site scripting'], 'impact': 'execute arbitrary code', 'vector': 'malicious payload', 'attacker': 'attacker', 'product': 'Qwik', 'version': 'up to 1.5.9', 'component': ''}, reference_content='Based on the provided information, here\\'s an analysis of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**Root Cause:**\\n- The vulnerability stems from improper HTML escaping during server-side rendering in Qwik. The framework uses different escaping rules depending on whether the string is an attribute value or other text content. This inconsistency leads to the potential for a mismatch between the expected DOM tree on the server-side and the actual DOM tree rendered in the browser, leading to mXSS.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\\n- **Inconsistent HTML Escaping:** Qwik uses different escaping logic for attribute values and other HTML content. Attribute values only escape `\"` and `&`, whereas other content escapes `<`, `>`, and `&`. This difference is the core vulnerability.\\n- **mXSS (Mutation XSS):** This vulnerability leads to a specific type of XSS called mutation XSS where the differences in the DOM tree rendered by the server and the browser can be manipulated to inject malicious code.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page which is executed in the victim\\'s browser.\\n- **Data Theft:** This can lead to stealing user\\'s cookies and session data.\\n- **Malicious Actions:** An attacker may perform actions on behalf of the user, including data manipulation and redirecting the user to malicious websites.\\n- **Page Defacement:** The injected script can modify the appearance and content of the web page.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n- **Network:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability over the network.\\n- **User-Supplied Input:** The attacker can inject malicious code through URL parameters or other user-controllable data.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- **No special privileges required**: The attacker does not need any account or prior knowledge of the target other than the server URL.\\n- **User Interaction**: The attacker needs the user to visit a crafted URL that contains malicious code as a query parameter.\\n\\n**Technical Details:**\\n\\n- The vulnerability is located in the `packages/qwik/src/core/render/ssr/render-ssr.ts` file.\\n- The problematic escaping logic (pre-fix) was located in `packages/qwik/src/core/render/ssr/render-ssr.ts#L1182-L1208`\\n- The `escapeAttr` function only escaped `\"` and `&`\\n- The `escapeHtml` function only escaped `<`, `>`, and `&`\\n\\n**Patch:**\\n- The patch introduces a single `escapeHtml` function that escapes `&`, `<`, `>`, `\\'`, and `\"` for both attribute values and other content, fixing the discrepancy.\\n\\n**Example of Exploit:**\\n- The provided PoC (Proof of Concept) showcases the vulnerability by injecting the following code into a URL parameter `href`: `</noscript><script>alert(123)</script>`.\\n- This injects a script that executes `alert(123)` demonstrating the ability to run arbitrary JavaScript code.\\n\\n**CVSS Metrics:**\\n- The vulnerability is rated as Moderate with a CVSS score of 6.3.\\n- The CVSS vector is `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L`.\\n\\n**Affected Versions:**\\n- Versions prior to 1.6.0 are affected.\\n\\n**Patched Versions:**\\n- Version 1.7.3 and later contain the fix.\\n\\n**CWE:**\\n- The vulnerability is associated with CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting).', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '79', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:improper HTML escaping', 'keyphrase': 'improper HTML escaping', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS vulnerability', 'keyphrase': 'XSS vulnerability', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:execute arbitrary code', 'keyphrase': 'execute arbitrary code', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'vector:malicious payload', 'keyphrase': 'malicious payload', 'type': 'vector'}, {'id': 'attacker:attacker', 'keyphrase': 'attacker', 'type': 'attacker'}, {'id': 'product:Qwik', 'keyphrase': 'Qwik', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:up to 1.5.9', 'keyphrase': 'up to 1.5.9', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(698.6192335793753)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    Qwik is a performance focused javascript framework. A potential mutation **XSS vulnerability** exists in Qwik for versions up to but not including 1.6.0. Qwik improperly escapes HTML on server-side rendering. It converts strings according to the rules found in the `render-ssr.ts` file. It sometimes causes the situation that the final DOM tree rendered on browsers is different from what Qwik expects on server-side rendering. This may be leveraged to perform XSS attacks, and a type of the XSS is known as mXSS (mutation XSS). This has been resolved in qwik version 1.6.0 and @builder.io/qwik version 1.7.3. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'improper HTML escaping'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
