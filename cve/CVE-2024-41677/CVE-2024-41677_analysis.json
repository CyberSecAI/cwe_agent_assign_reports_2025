  "description": "Qwik is a performance focused javascript framework. A potential mutation **XSS vulnerability** exists in Qwik for versions up to but not including 1.6.0. Qwik improperly escapes HTML on server-side rendering. It converts strings according to the rules found in the `render-ssr.ts` file. It sometimes causes the situation that the final DOM tree rendered on browsers is different from what Qwik expects on server-side rendering. This may be leveraged to perform XSS attacks, and a type of the XSS is known as mXSS (mutation XSS). This has been resolved in qwik version 1.6.0 and @builder.io/qwik version 1.7.3. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The vulnerability stems from improper HTML escaping during server-side rendering in Qwik. The framework uses different escaping rules depending on whether the string is an attribute value or other text content. This inconsistency leads to the potential for a mismatch between the expected DOM tree on the server-side and the actual DOM tree rendered in the browser, leading to mXSS.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Inconsistent HTML Escaping:** Qwik uses different escaping logic for attribute values and other HTML content. Attribute values only escape `\"` and `&`, whereas other content escapes `<`, `>`, and `&`. This difference is the core vulnerability.\n- **mXSS (Mutation XSS):** This vulnerability leads to a specific type of XSS called mutation XSS where the differences in the DOM tree rendered by the server and the browser can be manipulated to inject malicious code.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page which is executed in the victim's browser.\n- **Data Theft:** This can lead to stealing user's cookies and session data.\n- **Malicious Actions:** An attacker may perform actions on behalf of the user, including data manipulation and redirecting the user to malicious websites.\n- **Page Defacement:** The injected script can modify the appearance and content of the web page.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability over the network.\n- **User-Supplied Input:** The attacker can inject malicious code through URL parameters or other user-controllable data.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **No special privileges required**: The attacker does not need any account or prior knowledge of the target other than the server URL.\n- **User Interaction**: The attacker needs the user to visit a crafted URL that contains malicious code as a query parameter.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\n- The vulnerability is located in the `packages/qwik/src/core/render/ssr/render-ssr.ts` file.\n- The problematic escaping logic (pre-fix) was located in `packages/qwik/src/core/render/ssr/render-ssr.ts#L1182-L1208`\n- The `escapeAttr` function only escaped `\"` and `&`\n- The `escapeHtml` function only escaped `<`, `>`, and `&`\n\n**Patch:**\n- The patch introduces a single `escapeHtml` function that escapes `&`, `<`, `>`, `'`, and `\"` for both attribute values and other content, fixing the discrepancy.\n\n**Example of Exploit:**\n- The provided PoC (Proof of Concept) showcases the vulnerability by injecting the following code into a URL parameter `href`: `</noscript><script>alert(123)</script>`.\n- This injects a script that executes `alert(123)` demonstrating the ability to run arbitrary JavaScript code.\n\n**CVSS Metrics:**\n- The vulnerability is rated as Moderate with a CVSS score of 6.3.\n- The CVSS vector is `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L`.\n\n**Affected Versions:**\n- Versions prior to 1.6.0 are affected.\n\n**Patched Versions:**\n- Version 1.7.3 and later contain the fix.\n\n**CWE:**\n- The vulnerability is associated with CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting).",

The root cause is the **improper escaping**, and the resulting weakness is the **XSS vulnerability**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment correctly identifies CWE-79 as the primary candidate due to the **XSS vulnerability** resulting from **improper HTML escaping**. The description clearly states that Qwik **improperly escapes HTML** on server-side rendering, leading to discrepancies in the DOM tree and potential **XSS attacks**. This aligns directly with the definition of CWE-79, which involves **improper neutralization of user-controllable input** before it is placed in output that is used as a web page.\n\nCWE-116 was considered as a secondary factor because the **improper escaping** is a form of **improper encoding or escaping of output**. It's a broader category that encompasses the specific issue of HTML escaping.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-79 being a Base-level CWE that directly addresses the **XSS vulnerability**, and CWE-116 providing additional context as a Class-level CWE related to output handling.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
