The `sort` parameter is directly concatenated into the SQL statement without proper filtering.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   HTTP request with a crafted `sort` parameter.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not specify a fix, but implies that proper input validation and sanitization of the `sort` parameter are required to prevent the SQL injection vulnerability.\n\n**Details more than official CVE description:**\n\nThe content provides a detailed analysis of the vulnerability, including:\n\n*   Specific file paths where the vulnerability exists (`com/cloudweb/oa/mapper/xml/OaNoticeMapper.xml:58`, `com/cloudweb/oa/mapper/OaNoticeMapper.java:30`, `com/cloudweb/oa/service/impl/OaNoticeServiceImpl.java:117`, `com/cloudweb/oa/controller/OaNoticeController.java:131`).\n*   The exact parameter that is vulnerable (`sort`).\n*   A Proof of Concept (POC) exploit: `http://localhost:8096/oa/notice/list?sort=) tmp_cunto where 1=1 and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,user(),0x7e),1)-- -`\n*   Screenshots illustrating the code flow and vulnerability location.\n*   CVE-2025-25582 is also mentioned, potentially a related or duplicate CVE.",

The other CWEs considered, such as CWE-79 (Cross-Site Scripting) and CWE-78 (OS Command Injection), are related to injection but are not the direct cause in this case. The hierarchical relationships confirm that CWE-89 is the most specific and relevant to this vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe79 -->|PEEROF| cwe78\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74,cwe78,cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-89 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'). The `sort` parameter is directly concatenated into the SQL query without sanitization.\n2.  **Impact:** Arbitrary SQL queries can be executed, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly supports the selection of CWE-89 as the primary CWE for this vulnerability. The vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary both clearly indicate that the **root cause** is an **SQL injection** due to **improper neutralization** of the `sort` parameter. The high similarity score and the base abstraction level of CWE-89 further confirm its suitability. Other CWEs, while related to injection, do not accurately represent the specific flaw. The evidence from the CVE reference summary includes a proof-of-concept exploit, which confirms the direct injection of SQL commands.\n- \"The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `/oa/notice/list` interface due to unsanitized input in the `sort` parameter.
