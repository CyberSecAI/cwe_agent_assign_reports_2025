This could be done via malicious links or embedded content on a website that the user visits.\\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into executing a crafted request. The user needs to have sufficient privileges within the WordPress environment for the forged request to be effective. The attacker doesn't require any authentication on the vulnerable website.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '1275', 'name': 'Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The SameSite attribute for sensitive cookies is not set, or an insecure value is used.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:Cross-Site Request Forgery', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery', 'type': 'weakness'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(213.14338382396534)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:improper user authentication', 'keyphrase': 'improper user authentication', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:Cross-Site Request Forgery', 'keyphrase': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:Stored XSS', 'keyphrase': 'Stored XSS', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'product:RudeStan VKontakte Wall Post', 'keyphrase': 'RudeStan VKontakte Wall Post', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:through 2.0', 'keyphrase': 'through 2.0', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(188.24786568191814)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '89', 'name': \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\", 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
