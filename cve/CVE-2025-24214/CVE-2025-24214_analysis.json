I am picking CWE-532 based on the description indicating that the logging of text fields was the weakness and it was addressed. There could be other weaknesses, but this is the only one mentioned.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe532 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe **root cause** is logging sensitive data to log files, which leads to the impact of an app being able to access sensitive user data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment was based on the provided evidence, which is limited. The vulnerability description states that a privacy issue was addressed by not logging contents of text fields, suggesting that sensitive information was previously being logged. The retriever results suggest other potential CWEs, such as CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-665 (Improper Initialization), but there is no direct evidence in the provided description to support these.\n\nThe decision to assign CWE-532 is based on the explicit mention of logging as the issue. The other suggestions could be related, but without more information, CWE-532 is the most directly supported. The level of specificity is optimal because it directly addresses the stated weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not used because the vulnerability description does not indicate any observable discrepancies.*\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
