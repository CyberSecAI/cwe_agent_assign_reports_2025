The root cause of this exposure is **Missing Authorization** (CWE-862). CWE-862 is a parent of more specific authorization-related CWEs, but the description doesn't provide enough detail to pinpoint a more specific variant.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe200 <--|IMPACT| cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** (CWE-862), which leads to **sensitive information exposure** (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis focuses on identifying the root cause and the resulting vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly states that the WordPress core search feature does not respect the content restrictions imposed by the plugin, leading to **sensitive information exposure**. This directly points to a **missing authorization** check. The selection of CWE-200 and CWE-862 is based on the evidence that unauthenticated users can access restricted content, exposing sensitive information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n*Not Selected*: This vulnerability is not related to CSRF.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: While related to authorization, CWE-862 is a better fit as it directly addresses the **missing authorization** check.\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**:

Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root

mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: This vulnerability is not related to externally controllable parameters.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or

of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: While related, CWE-200 is a more general case and applies better here.\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes

level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected*: Close match, but CWE-200 is preferred because it focuses on exposure rather than insertion.\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more
