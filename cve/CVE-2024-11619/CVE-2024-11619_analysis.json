  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in macrozheng mall up to 1.0.3. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the component JWT Token Handler. The manipulation leads to **use of default cryptographic key**. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way. Instead the issue posted on GitHub got deleted without any explanation.",

CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) is a variant and a peer of CWE-1394, representing a similar but slightly different weakness. CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm) is a class-level weakness that encompasses both CWE-1394 and CWE-321. The choice of CWE-1394 as primary is due to the explicit mention of \"default cryptographic key\" in the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1394[\"CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe327[\"CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm\"]\n    \n    cwe1394 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe327\n    cwe321 --|PEEROF| cwe1394\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1394 primary\n    class cwe321,cwe327 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a default cryptographic key** (CWE-1394). This can lead to unauthorized access or data compromise if the default key is known or easily guessed. The chain is relatively short in this case:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key\n2.  **Impact:** Potential unauthorized access, data compromise.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning the **use of default cryptographic key**. The retriever results also list CWE-1394 with a high score. The graph relationships show that CWE-1394 is a specific type of cryptographic issue that falls under the broader category of CWE-327.\n\nThe selection of CWE-1394 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the described vulnerability. Using CWE-327 would be too general, while using CWE-321 might be inaccurate if the key is a default one rather than a hardcoded one. The evidence provided is the vulnerability description key phrase: \"**rootcause:** **use of default cryptographic key**\".\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
