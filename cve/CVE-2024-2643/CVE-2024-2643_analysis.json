It details a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the My Sticky Bar (formerly myStickymenu) plugin for WordPress. Here's an extraction of the relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings, allowing for XSS attacks.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nHigh privilege users (like admins) can execute malicious scripts, even when `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed (e.g., in multisite setups).\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Modifying the `mysticky_option_welcomebar[mysticky_welcomebar_x_color]` field with a malicious payload (e.g., `\"#000000\"onmouseover=alert(1)//`).\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Admin or user with high privileges.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.6.8 of the plugin.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2024-2643 is explicitly referenced.\n*   **CVSS Score:** 3.5 (Low)\n*   **Researcher:** Dmitrii Ignatyev (CleanTalk Research)\n*   **Proof of Concept:** Provided, detailing how to trigger the XSS.\n*   **Affected Plugin:** mystickymenu\n*   **OWASP Category:** A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n*   **CWE:** CWE-79\n*   **Timeline:** Publicly published on 2024-02-28, added on 2024-03-26, last updated on 2024-03-26.",
