# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-6586

## Vulnerability Description
Lightdash version 0.1024.6 allows users with the necessary permissions, such as Administrator or Editor, to create and share dashboards. A dashboard that contains HTML elements which point to a threat actor controlled source can trigger an SSRF request when exported, via a POST request to /api/v1/dashboards//export. The forged request contains the value of the exporting users session token. A threat actor could obtain the session token of any user who exports the dashboard. The obtained session token can be used to perform actions as the victim on the application, resulting in session takeover.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** session takeover
- **attacker:** users with necessary permissions
- **product:** Lightdash
- **version:** 0.1024.6

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-6586:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how Lightdash's dashboard export functionality uses Puppeteer. Specifically, Puppeteer was setting sensitive headers, including cookies, on requests made to the headless browser during dashboard export. This resulted in the exporting user's session cookie being included in requests to external domains embedded within the dashboard.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application allows the injection of HTML elements into a dashboard, which, when exported, trigger HTTP requests to attacker-controlled domains.
*   **Session Cookie Exposure:** The SSRF vulnerability leads to the leakage of the exporting user's session cookie to the attacker-controlled domain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **User Session Hijacking:** An attacker can steal the session cookie and use it to impersonate the user, gaining unauthorized access to the application.
*   **Administrative Control Takeover:** If an administrative user's session is compromised, the attacker could gain complete control over the Lightdash instance.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTML Injection:** The attacker injects malicious HTML, including `<iframe>` or `<img>` tags with attacker-controlled URLs, into a shared dashboard's markdown content.
*   **Dashboard Export:** Any user who exports a dashboard containing the injected HTML will trigger the SSRF and leak their session cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account on the Lightdash application.
*   **Dashboard Creation/Editing Permissions:** The attacker needs the ability to create or edit shared dashboards to inject the malicious HTML.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs an accessible endpoint to receive the exfiltrated cookies.

**Additional Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability was present in Lightdash version 0.1024.6.
*   The issue was resolved in version 0.1027.2 by changing the method of setting the cookie for the puppeteer browser.
*   The fix involved extracting the `connect.sid` cookie value and using `page.setCookie` instead of `page.setExtraHTTPHeaders`, ensuring the cookie was properly scoped to the application's domain.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by any user exporting a dashboard with the injected code.
*   The vulnerability can be combined with XSS attacks (CVE-2024-6585) to force users to export malicious dashboards.
*   CVSS v3 score: 7.3 (High), CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

**Remediation:**
Upgrade to Lightdash version 0.1027.2 or later.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set ‚Äì Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* üîç *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* üîç *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion ‚Äì CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### üî∏ CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúA user created with the ‚Äòguest‚Äô role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúThe backup service runs as root but only needs read access.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### üî∏ CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúUser can access another user‚Äôs invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.‚Äù*

## Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *‚ÄúUser can escalate privileges to admin.‚Äù*
> ‚ùå Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged ‚Äì only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ‚úÖ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**
