  "description": "An issue was discovered in za-internet C-MOR Video Surveillance 5.2401. Due to **improper privilege management concerning sudo privileges**, C-MOR is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. The Linux user www-data running the C-MOR web interface can execute some OS commands as root via Sudo without having to enter the root password. These commands, for example, include cp, chown, and chmod, which enable an attacker to modify the systems sudoers file in order to execute all commands with root privileges. Thus, it is possible to escalate the limited privileges of the user www-data to root privileges.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-45173\n\n**Vulnerability:** Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269)\n\n**Root Cause:** The C-MOR Video Surveillance software allows the `www-data` user, which runs the web interface, to execute specific OS commands as root via `sudo` without requiring the root password.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n*   **Improper Privilege Management:** The software grants the `www-data` user excessive privileges by allowing it to run certain commands as root using `sudo` without password authentication.\n*  **Insecure `sudo` Configuration:** The `sudo` configuration permits specific commands like `cp`, `chown`, and `chmod` to be executed by the `www-data` user as root.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Privilege Escalation:** By leveraging the ability to execute commands as root, an attacker can modify the system's `/etc/sudoers` file, granting the `www-data` user (or any attacker controlled user) unrestricted root privileges.\n*   **Full System Control:** Gaining root access allows the attacker to take complete control of the C-MOR system.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Shell Access:** The attacker requires shell access to the C-MOR system as the `www-data` user. This can be achieved through exploiting other vulnerabilities like unrestricted file upload (SYSS-2024-026, CVE-2024-45171) to upload a webshell.\n*   **Command Execution:** The attacker then uses the existing sudo privileges to execute the commands to modify the sudoers file and obtain root access.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Initial Access:** The attacker needs some initial access to the system, specifically shell access with `www-data` user privileges. This could be through exploiting other vulnerabilities or having compromised credentials.\n*   **Command Execution Knowledge:**  The attacker needs the knowledge to exploit the misconfigured sudo privileges and modify the system's sudoers file.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n*   The vulnerability affects C-MOR Video Surveillance versions 5.2401 and 6.00PL01.\n*   A proof of concept (PoC) is provided, demonstrating how to escalate privileges.\n*   There is no fix available at the time of the advisory.\n*   The vulnerability was discovered by Chris Beiter, Frederik Beimgraben, and Matthias Deeg.\n*   The vendor was notified on 2024-04-05 and a public disclosure occurred on 2024-09-04.\n*   The software is an IP video surveillance system.\n\nThe provided content offers more detail than a typical CVE description by outlining the specific commands that can be abused and includes a PoC of the exploit.",

CWE-266 is at the Base level, which is more specific than its parent, CWE-269, and accurately reflects the vulnerability: an incorrect assignment of privileges. The privilege escalation is a consequence of this **incorrect privilege assignment**.
