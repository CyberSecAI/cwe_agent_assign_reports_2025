  "description": "Starship is a cross-shell prompt. Starting in version 1.0.0 and prior to version 1.20.0, **undocumented and unpredictable shell expansion and/or quoting rules** make it easily to accidentally cause **shell injection** when using custom commands with starship in bash. This issue only affects users with custom commands, so the scope is limited, and without knowledge of others commands, it could be hard to successfully target someone. Version 1.20.0 fixes the vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-41815:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is the lack of proper escaping of command output within the custom module of the `starship` project. The `starship` prompt displays the output of user-defined commands without escaping characters that could be interpreted by the shell.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Shell Injection:** The primary vulnerability is shell injection. When a custom command's output contains special shell characters like backticks (`) or `$()`, they are interpreted by the shell, potentially executing arbitrary commands embedded in the output.\n- **Inadequate Documentation:** The documentation failed to clearly warn users about the shell injection risk, particularly with backticks and `$()`, focusing more on prompt-specific escape sequences. It also did not provide sufficient guidance on how to properly quote or escape characters in custom commands to avoid shell injection.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker who can control the output of a custom command (e.g., through a crafted commit message or a compromised external resource) can inject malicious shell commands.\n- **System Compromise:** Successfully exploited shell injections can lead to system compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions, depending on the permissions of the user running the `starship` prompt.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Custom Command Output:** The primary attack vector is through the output of custom commands configured within `starship`.\n- **Unverified Sources:** If a custom command fetches data from an external or untrusted source, an attacker could manipulate that source to inject malicious code into the command's output.\n- **Crafted Commit Messages:** As highlighted in the details, a crafted git commit message with backticks could be used to trigger the vulnerability when a user's custom command displays it.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Configuration Control:** Attackers need the ability to influence or control the output of a custom command used by a `starship` user.\n- **User Interaction:** The user must have `starship` configured to use a vulnerable custom command.\n- **Limited Scope:** The vulnerability is limited to users who use custom commands and depends on their specific configurations.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The vulnerability was addressed in `starship` version 1.20.0 by escaping the output by default, with an option to disable escaping via `unsafe_no_escape`.\n- The vulnerability is classified as low severity, likely due to its limited scope.\n- The fix was introduced in commit `cfc58161e0ec595db90af686ad77a73df6d44d74`.\n- The reporter of the vulnerability was evanbattaglia.\n- The advisory is documented under GHSA-vx24-x4mv-vwr5.\n\nThis content provides more detailed information than the typical CVE description, explaining the specific circumstances and code leading to the vulnerability.",

The vulnerability is clearly an instance of OS Command Injection due to the **lack of proper escaping** of command output, leading to arbitrary code execution.
