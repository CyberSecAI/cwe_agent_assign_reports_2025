  "description": "**Improper neutralization of quoting syntax** in PostgreSQL libpq functions PQescapeLiteral(), PQescapeIdentifier(), PQescapeString(), and PQescapeStringConn() allows a database input provider to achieve **SQL injection** in certain usage patterns. Specifically, **SQL injection** requires the application to use the function result to construct input to psql, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal. Similarly, improper neutralization of quoting syntax in PostgreSQL command line utility programs allows a source of command line arguments to achieve **SQL injection** when client_encoding is BIG5 and server_encoding is one of EUC_TW or MULE_INTERNAL. Versions before PostgreSQL 17.3, 16.7, 15.11, 14.16, and 13.19 are affected.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-1094 based on provided content:\n\n**Overall:** The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2025-1094) in PostgreSQL, specifically related to improper neutralization of quoting syntax in certain functions. It also describes a regression introduced by the initial fix and a subsequent release to address it.\n\n**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   Improper neutralization of quoting syntax in PostgreSQL `libpq` functions (`PQescapeLiteral()`, `PQescapeIdentifier()`, `PQescapeString()`, and `PQescapeStringConn()`).\n*   This allows a database input provider to achieve SQL injection under certain usage patterns.\n*   Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when the application uses the function result to construct input to `psql`, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.\n*   Also affects command line utility programs when `client_encoding` is `BIG5` and `server_encoding` is `EUC_TW` or `MULE_INTERNAL`.\n\n**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n*   Improper Input Validation/Sanitization\n*   Quoting issues\n\n**3. Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   SQL injection, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands.\n\n**4. Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Providing crafted input to PostgreSQL through applications using the vulnerable `libpq` functions.\n*   Exploitation via the `psql` interactive terminal.\n*   Exploitation via command line utility programs with specific encoding configurations.\n\n**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to provide input to a PostgreSQL database through a vulnerable application or directly via `psql` or a command-line tool.\n\n**6. Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade to PostgreSQL versions 17.3, 16.7, 15.11, 14.16, or 13.19 (initial fix).\n*   Upgrade to PostgreSQL versions 17.4, 16.8, 15.12, 14.17, or 13.20 (to address the regression introduced by the initial fix).\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The initial fix for CVE-2025-1094 introduced a regression where `PQescapeLiteral` and `PQescapeIdentifier` ignored their length parameter, potentially leading to buffer overflows. This regression was addressed in subsequent releases.\n*   The vulnerability was reported by Stephen Fewer of Rapid7.\n*   CVSS score: 8.1 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)\n*   Details on SSL support and environment variables related to libpq are provided in the documentation links.",

The root cause is the **improper neutralization of quoting syntax**, which is represented by CWE-149. CWE-149 is a variant of CWE-138 (**Improper Neutralization of Special Elements**), indicating a hierarchical relationship. The vulnerability chain starts with the failure to properly neutralize quoting syntax (CWE-149), leading to the possibility of injecting SQL commands (CWE-89). The selection of CWE-89 as the primary weakness is supported by its direct relevance to the impact described in the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe149[\"CWE-149: Improper Neutralization of Quoting Syntax\"]\n    cwe138[\"CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\"]\n    \n    cwe149 -->|CHILDOF| cwe138\n    cwe89 -->|RESULTED_FROM| cwe149\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe149 secondary\n    class cwe138 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with **improper neutralization of quoting syntax** (CWE-149). This leads to the construction of malicious SQL commands, which results in **SQL injection** (CWE-89). The initial flaw is the root cause, while the SQL injection is the direct impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, particularly the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The description explicitly mentions **\"improper neutralization of quoting syntax\"** as the root cause and **\"SQL injection\"** as the impact. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further confirms this assessment. The hierarchical relationship between CWE-149 and CWE-138 provides a broader context for understanding the **improper neutralization** issue.\n\nCWE-89 is selected as the primary weakness because it directly represents the vulnerability's impact, which is SQL injection. CWE-149 is selected as a secondary weakness because it captures the root cause of the vulnerability: the **improper neutralization of quoting syntax**. These CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, as they accurately reflect the vulnerability's characteristics.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a query intended to access or manipulate data in a data store such as a database, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that can modify the intended logic of the query.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
