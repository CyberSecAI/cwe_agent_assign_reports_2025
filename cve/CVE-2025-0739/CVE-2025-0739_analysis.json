CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) are higher-level Class and Pillar CWEs, respectively, and are considered as secondary candidates. CWE-639 offers a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability's root cause than its broader parent categories.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **Improper Access Control** leading to the ability of an authenticated attacker to show subscriptions information of other users by changing the SUSCBRIPTION_ID param of the endpoint /demos/embedai/subscriptions/show/. The root cause is the **authorization bypass through a user-controlled key**, which allows unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) because the vulnerability description clearly states that an authenticated attacker can show subscriptions information of other users by changing the `SUSCBRIPTION_ID` parameter. This aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-639, where a user can gain access to another user's data by modifying the key value.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is: \"This vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to show subscriptions information of others users by changing the SUSCBRIPTION_ID param of the endpoint /demos/embedai/subscriptions/show/.\" This demonstrates a clear case of authorization bypass via a user-controlled key.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was considered but is a higher-level class, and CWE-639 provides more specific details. CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) is a pillar-level CWE and is too general. CWE-639 is at the optimal level of specificity, accurately representing the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
