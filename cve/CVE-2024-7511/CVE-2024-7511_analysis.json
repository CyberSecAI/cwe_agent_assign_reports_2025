  "description": "Trimble SketchUp Pro SKP File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Trimble SketchUp Pro. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PSD files embedded in SKP files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-23000.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7511:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PSD files embedded within SKP files in Trimble SketchUp Pro. Specifically, the issue occurs during the parsing process of PSD data.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The lack of validation allows an attacker to craft a malicious PSD file that, when parsed, causes the software to read past the end of an allocated buffer. This is a memory corruption issue.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the disclosure of sensitive information from the application's memory.\n*   **Potential for further exploitation:** The advisory mentions that this out-of-bounds read vulnerability can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Malicious SKP file:** An attacker can embed a specially crafted PSD file within an SKP file.\n*   **User Interaction:** The user must open the malicious SKP file in Trimble SketchUp Pro for the vulnerability to be triggered.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious SKP file with a specially crafted PSD embedded within it.\n*   The attacker relies on the victim opening the malicious file, indicating a requirement for user interaction.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n* The vulnerability is fixed in SketchUp version 24.0.553\n* The CVSS score is 3.3 with vector string AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N, indicating low impact and exploitability.",

CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a broader class of weakness and can be considered a contributing factor but is discouraged to use. The vulnerability leads to information disclosure, which is the impact. The analysis focuses on identifying the root cause, which is the out-of-bounds read due to the lack of input validation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (Improper Input Validation), leading to an **out-of-bounds read** when parsing PSD files embedded in SKP files. This **out-of-bounds read** results in **information disclosure**.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) -> CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) -> Information Disclosure\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several potential CWEs based on the keyphrases in the vulnerability description. However, the primary focus was to identify the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly states that the issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which leads to an **out-of-bounds read**. Therefore, CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) is selected as the primary CWE because it directly describes the coding error. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) could be considered a contributing factor, as the **lack of proper validation** enables the **out-of-bounds read**. However, CWE-20 is a broad class and is discouraged to use when more specific CWEs are available. The analysis is based on the provided evidence, and the relationships between the CWEs support the final selection. The selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity, as it accurately represents the coding error that leads to the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates an **out-of-bounds read** due to the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** when parsing PSD files embedded in SKP files. This results in information disclosure.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not considered*: This CWE describes the impact (exposure of sensitive information) rather than the root cause.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
