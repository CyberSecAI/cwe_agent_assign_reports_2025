However, in ngbe_probe() function, the subsequent error paths after ngbe_sw_init() dont free the rss_key. Fix that by freeing it in error path along with wx->mac_table.

However, in ngbe_probe() function, the subsequent error paths after ngbe_sw_init() dont free the rss_key. Fix that by freeing it in error path along with wx->mac_table. Also change the label to which execution jumps when ngbe_sw_init() fails, because otherwise, it could lead to a **double free** for rss_key, when the mac_table allocation fails in wx_sw_init().\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## WEAKNESS: 'double free'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1.
