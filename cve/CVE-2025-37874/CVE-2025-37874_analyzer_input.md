# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-37874

# Vulnerability Description

    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net ngbe fix **memory leak** in ngbe_probe() error path When ngbe_sw_init() is called, memory is allocated for wx->rss_key in wx_init_rss_key(). However, in ngbe_probe() function, the subsequent error paths after ngbe_sw_init() dont free the rss_key. Fix that by freeing it in error path along with wx->mac_table. Also change the label to which execution jumps when ngbe_sw_init() fails, because otherwise, it could lead to a **double free** for rss_key, when the mac_table allocation fails in wx_sw_init().

    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis
    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. 
    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.

    ## WEAKNESS: 'double free'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-415: Double Free (Score: 541.95)

The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations....

### 2. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 476.22)

The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently....

### 3. CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition (Score: 442.71)

The product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition....

### 4. CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime (Score: 436.26)

The product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory....

### 5. CWE-911: Improper Update of Reference Count (Score: 425.88)

The product uses a reference count to manage a resource, but it does not update or incorrectly updates the reference count....

The product does not initialize a critical resource....

### 4. CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime (Score: 436.26)

The product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory....
