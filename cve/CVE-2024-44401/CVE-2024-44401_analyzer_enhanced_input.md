- **component:** upgrade_filter.asp file

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation in the `upgrade_filter.asp` file, specifically within the `sub_47A60C` function of the `jhttpd` web service. The function concatenates the user-supplied 'path' parameter into a system command without proper sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Command Injection",
       "Insufficient Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the target device.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request to the `upgrade_filter.asp` file, where the attacker manipulates the 'path' parameter to inject shell commands.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. Authentication is likely required, as the provided exploit code includes a `gw_userid` and `gw_passwd` cookie."
