# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-11540

## Description

IrfanView DXF File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Read Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24700.

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), which is a Base level CWE. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a Class-level CWE and represents a broader category that encompasses the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**. CWE-125 can be caused by CWE-20.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-20), which leads to an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125), ultimately resulting in remote code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly states that the issue is due to a **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, resulting in an out-of-bounds read. The root cause is the **lack of input validation**, and the weakness is an **out-of-bounds read**, which aligns perfectly with CWE-125.

The evidence supports the selection of CWE-125 as the primary CWE. The vulnerability description mentions the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** which leads to an **out-of-bounds read**. This aligns with the description of CWE-125, which describes a scenario where the product reads data past the end of an intended buffer.

CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is considered a secondary CWE because the description highlights the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**. While important, it's a more general weakness that leads to the specific out-of-bounds read. The Retriever Results also lists CWE-20 but at a lower rank.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-125 is a Base-level CWE, which is preferred.

The product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense
