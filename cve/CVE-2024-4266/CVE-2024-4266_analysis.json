While more specific CWEs exist, the provided information doesn't pinpoint a more granular weakness. The graph also shows relationship between CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) and CWE-200 since a missing authentication could lead to exposure of sensitive information, but it isn't clearly established in the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with potentially **missing authentication** or **authorization**, which leads to the **exposure of sensitive information**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) as the primary weakness, supported by the description mentioning \"**Sensitive Information Exposure**\" and the ability of \"unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data\".\n\nThe Retriever Results also suggested CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). The vulnerability description says \"unauthenticated attackers\" which could point to a missing authentication or authorization check which would precede the sensitive information exposure. However, the description focuses on the exposure itself, rather than explicitly stating that authentication is missing.\n\nThe final decision favors CWE-200 as the primary weakness due to the direct mention of \"**Sensitive Information Exposure**\". CWE-306 is a secondary candidate since the **lack of authentication** is implied but not explicitly stated.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were
