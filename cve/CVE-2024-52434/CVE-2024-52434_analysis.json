  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Vulnerability:** Remote Code Execution (RCE)\n\n**Affected Software:** WordPress Popup by Supsystic Plugin\n\n**Vulnerable Versions:** <= 1.10.29\n\n**Fixed Version:** 1.10.30\n\n**Root Cause:** The plugin has an injection vulnerability that allows for RCE.  The specific injection type is not specified, but the OWASP Top 10 classification points to A3: Injection.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n*   **Injection Vulnerability:** The plugin is vulnerable to an injection flaw, enabling attackers to inject malicious code.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the target website's server.\n*   **Full Website Control:** RCE can lead to attackers gaining complete control of the website.\n*   **Backdoor Access:** Attackers can establish persistent backdoor access to the compromised website.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, meaning the attacker doesn't need physical access to the server.\n*   **Injection:** The attacker leverages an injection vulnerability to execute malicious code.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Administrator Privileges:** An attacker needs administrator privileges on the WordPress site to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.1, which is categorized as \"low\" severity by Patchstack. This seems contradictory, and the severity is likely high despite the low priority classification.\n*   The vulnerability was reported by \"Hakiduck\".\n*   The issue is classified under OWASP Top 10 A3: Injection.\n*   Patchstack recommends updating to version 1.10.30 or later.",
