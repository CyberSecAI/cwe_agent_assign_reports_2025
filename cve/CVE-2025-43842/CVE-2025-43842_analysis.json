  "description": "Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI is a voice changing framework based on VITS. Versions 2.2.231006 and prior are vulnerable to **command injection**. The variables exp_dir1, np7, trainset_dir4 and sr2 take user input and pass it to the preprocess_dataset function, which concatenates them into a command that is run on the server. This can lead to arbitrary command execution. As of time of publication, no known patches exist.",

It is a child of CWE-77 and CWE-74, which are higher-level classes. CWE-88 is also a base-level CWE that can be an alternative to CWE-78.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe88[\"CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe78 -- CANALSOBE --> cwe88\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77,cwe74,cwe88 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with user input being passed to the `exp_dir1`, `np7`, `trainset_dir4` and `sr2` variables. This input is then concatenated into a command that is run on the server without proper neutralization, leading to OS command injection and arbitrary command execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is a clear case of **command injection**, where user-controlled input is incorporated into a system command without proper sanitization, leading to arbitrary command execution. The primary CWE is CWE-78 because the command being executed is an OS command. The evidence is strong, with the CVE description and the securitylab.github.com writeup both explicitly mentioning command injection as the vulnerability.\n\nThe retriever results also support this assessment, with CWE-77 and CWE-78 being the top candidates. The securitylab.github.com writeup even suggests CWE-77. Given that the injected command is an OS command, selecting CWE-78 is the more specific choice.\n\nCWE-88 was considered as a secondary candidate because argument delimiters might be involved, but the primary issue is the overall command injection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
