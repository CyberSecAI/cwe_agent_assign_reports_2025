    ## WEAKNESS: 'out-of-bounds write'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset (Score: 283.06)

The product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer....

### 2. CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read (Score: 276.41)

The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....

### 3. CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size (Score: 266.37)

The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow....

### 4. CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 264.38)

A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc()....

### 5. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 256.73)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...

### 1. CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset (Score: 283.06)

The product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer....

### 2. CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (Score: 264.38)

A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc()....

### 3. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 256.73)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...

### 4. CWE-126: Buffer Over-read (Score: 250.38)

The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer....

### 5. CWE-1295: Debug Messages Revealing Unnecessary Information (Score: 78.99)

The product fails to adequately prevent the revealing of unnecessary and potentially sensitive system information within debugging messages....

### 4. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 241.71)

The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties....

### 5. CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (Score: 72.37)

The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data....
