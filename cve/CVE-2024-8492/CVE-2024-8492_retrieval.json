It details a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Hustle plugin versions prior to 7.8.5. Here\\'s an extraction of the relevant information:\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\n\\nThe plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings, allowing for XSS attacks.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n\\n*   Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n\\nHigh privilege users (e.g., editors) can perform XSS attacks even when unfiltered\\\\_html is disallowed.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n\\n1.  Create a new Pop-up with the default template.\\n2.  Modify the \"Title\" field with arbitrary symbols.\\n3.  In the \"Emails\" settings, change the \"Validate\" field to `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`.\\n4.  Create a new Post and add a \"Popup Trigger\", selecting the newly created pop-up.\\n5.  Publish the post.\\n6.  Type invalid text in the Pop-up and click submit.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n\\n*   High privilege user (e.g., editor)\\n\\n**Mitigation or fix:**\\n\\n*   Upgrade to Hustle version 7.8.5 or later.\\n\\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\\n\\n*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2024-8492\\n*   **CVSS Score:** 3.5 (Low)\\n*   **Original Researcher:** Dmitrii Ignatyev\\n*   **WPVDB ID:** c7437eba-8e91-4fcc-82a3-ff8908b36877\\n*   **Timeline:**\\n    *   Publicly Published: 2024-07-29\\n    *   Added: 2024-09-13\\n    *   Last Updated: 2024-11-29\\n*   **References:**\\n    *   <https://research.cleantalk.org/cve-2024-8492/>\\n*   **OWASP Top 10:** A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\\n*   **CWE:** CWE-79', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:does not sanitise and escape some of its settings', 'keyphrase': 'does not sanitise and escape some of its settings', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'rootcause:improper sanitisation and escaping', 'keyphrase': 'improper sanitisation and escaping', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'impact:cross-site scripting attacks', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting attacks', 'type': 'impact'}, {'id': 'attacker:high privilege users', 'keyphrase': 'high privilege users', 'type': 'attacker'}, {'id': 'product:The Hustle WordPress plugin', 'keyphrase': 'The Hustle WordPress plugin', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:through 7.8.5', 'keyphrase': 'through 7.8.5', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(497.3134012511403)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
