# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-11567

## Vulnerability Description
IrfanView DXF File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24871.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the improper parsing of DXF files within IrfanView. Specifically, the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data leads to a read past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read due to insufficient input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process of IrfanView.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack requires user interaction. The target must either visit a malicious webpage or open a specially crafted malicious DXF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious DXF file that triggers the out-of-bounds read when parsed by IrfanView.
- The attacker also needs a way to deliver the malicious DXF file, such as embedding it in a website or sending it as an attachment.
