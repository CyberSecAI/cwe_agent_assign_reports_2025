## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
Root cause of vulnerability:
* The file upload functionality in "/admin/add_student.php" lacks proper validation of user-supplied files. Attackers can upload malicious scripts (php) due to missing file type checks and extension filtering.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
* CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
* Remote Code Execution via Unrestricted File Upload

Impact of exploitation:
* Malware Distribution
* Remote Code Execution (RCE)
* Data Breach
* Denial of Service (DoS)
* Web Shell Installation
* Bypassing Security Controls
* Reputation Damage

Attack vectors:
* By crafting a malicious file (e.g., "shell.php") and submitting it via the upload form, attackers can bypass security controls.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
* Attacker needs to be able to upload files to the "/admin/add_student.php" file upload module.

Mitigation or fix:
* Input Validation & Filtering: Ensure parameter allows only expected characters (e.g., digits or letters) to prevent path traversal attacks.
* Filename Sanitization: Strictly validate uploaded filenames. Avoid using user-provided original names and restrict allowed file extensions.
* Randomized Storage Names: Generate randomized filenames to prevent attackers from directly accessing malicious files.
* File Type Verification: Validate both file extensions and MIME types to detect spoofed formats.
* Storage Directory Permissions: Store uploaded files in a non-web-accessible directory or configure the server to disable script execution.
* Server Configuration: For Apache/Nginx, restrict execution permissions in upload directories (e.g., `php_flag engine off`).
* Error Handling: Avoid exposing internal path details by using custom error pages.
