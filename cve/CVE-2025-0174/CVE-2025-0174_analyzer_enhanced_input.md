## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in code-projects Point of Sales and Inventory Management System 1.0. It has been classified as critical. This affects an unknown part of the file /user/search_result2.php of the component Parameter Handler. The manipulation of the argument search leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **vector:** search argument manipulation
- **product:** code-projects Point of Sales and Inventory Management System
- **version:** 1.0
- **component:** /user/search_result2.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the `search_result2.php` file of a PHP-based POS inventory system.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (the `search` parameter) into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass authentication, access or modify sensitive data within the database, or potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `search` POST parameter in `search_result2.php` file of the vulnerable application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server.
- Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques is required to successfully craft a malicious payload.
