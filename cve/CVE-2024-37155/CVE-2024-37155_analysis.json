  "description": "OpenCTI is an open source platform allowing organizations to manage their cyber threat intelligence knowledge and observables. Prior to version 6.1.9, the regex validation used to prevent Introspection queries can be bypassed by removing the extra whitespace, carriage return, and line feed characters from the query. GraphQL Queries in OpenCTI can be validated using the `secureIntrospectionPlugin`. The regex check in the plkugin can be bypassed by removing the carriage return and line feed characters (`\\r\\n`). Running a curl command against a local instance of OpenCTI will result in a limited error message. By running the same Introspection query without the `\\r\\n` characters, the unauthenticated user is able to successfully run a full Introspection query. Bypassing this restriction allows the attacker to gather a wealth of information about the GraphQL endpoint functionality that can be used to perform actions and/or read data without authorization. These queries can also be weaponized to conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if sent repeatedly. Users should upgrade to version 6.1.9 to receive a patch for the issue.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-37155:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of GraphQL queries within the OpenCTI platform. The `secureIntrospectionPlugin` was designed to prevent unauthorized introspection queries, but it relied on a simple string-based check using `includes()`. This check could be bypassed by removing whitespace, carriage returns, and line feeds from the query strings, allowing attackers to perform introspection.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the use of a simple string-based `includes()` check to detect introspection queries, which is easily circumvented.\n*   **Bypass of Introspection Restriction:** The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass the intended restrictions on GraphQL schema introspection.\n*   **Lack of Robust Parsing:** The validation did not properly parse and analyze the query structure.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gather detailed information about the GraphQL endpoint, including schema, types, fields, and operations. This information can be used to craft further attacks.\n*   **Unauthorized Data Access/Manipulation:** The disclosed schema information can be used to perform actions and read data without proper authorization.\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Introspection queries, when sent repeatedly, can be used to conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, impacting the availability of the system.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network:** The attack can be carried out remotely over the network.\n*   **Direct GraphQL Requests:** Exploitation occurs by sending crafted GraphQL queries to the server.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the OpenCTI GraphQL endpoint.\n*   **GraphQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of GraphQL to craft the necessary introspection queries.\n*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without prior authentication (as mentioned in \"Privileges required: None\").\n\n**Additional Notes**\n\n*   The provided content also includes details about the fix, which involves a more robust check for introspection queries in commit `f87d969`.\n*   The vulnerability is identified with CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).\n*   The CVSS score is 6.5, indicating a \"Moderate\" severity.\n*   The fix commit `f87d969`  changed the introspection check to use `['__schema', '__type'].some((pattern) => request.query.includes(pattern))` which is still a string includes check but less vulnerable to bypass.\n\nIn summary, the vulnerability arises from a weak regular expression check that is easily bypassed by manipulating whitespace.",

CWE-20 is a class-level CWE representing a broad category of input validation issues. CWE-1286 is a base-level CWE that is a child of CWE-20 and specifically addresses the lack of validation of the syntactic correctness of input. The choice of CWE-20 as the primary CWE is based on the evidence suggesting the vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation in general, while CWE-1286 is a more specific instance. Additionally, CWE-306 was considered due to the impact of the vulnerability allowing unauthorized access, which could suggest a missing authentication issue for a critical function.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe1286[\"CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe1286 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe1286,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** (**CWE-20**). This leads to a **bypass of the introspection restriction** in GraphQL queries. This allows an **unauthenticated user** to gather information, perform unauthorized actions, and potentially conduct a denial-of-service attack.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment pointed towards **CWE-20** (Improper Input Validation) due to the **regex validation bypass**. The vulnerability description clearly states that the **root cause** is the insufficient validation of GraphQL queries using a regular expression that can be bypassed. The reference link content summary confirms that the vulnerability stems from **inadequate input validation**.\n\nHowever, **CWE-20** is a Class-level CWE and the description mentions the **regex validation bypass** and the bypass of introspection.\n\nTherefore, **CWE-1286** (Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input) was considered as a more specific option. However, the vulnerability doesn't explicitly mention a failure to validate the syntactic correctness, but rather a bypass of a validation using regex.\n\nThe guidance suggests that authentication issues should be categorized as **CWE-306**, while authorization failures should be categorized as **CWE-862 or CWE-863**. Given that the attacker is unauthenticated, **CWE-306** was considered as a potential candidate, since this allows an unauthenticated user to perform unauthorized actions.\n\nUltimately, **CWE-20** was selected as the primary CWE because the **root cause** is the **regex validation bypass**. The impact of this vulnerability is unauthorized access and potential DoS, but the underlying issue lies in how the input is being validated. **CWE-1286** and **CWE-306** are considered as secondary issues.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   **CWE-20**: Improper Input Validation\n    *   **Description**: The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly.\n    *   **Relevance**: This CWE directly applies as the GraphQL queries are not properly validated, allowing malicious queries to bypass restrictions.\n    *   **Abstraction Level**: Class\n    *   **Usage**: Discouraged, but chosen because a more specific CWE isn't a perfect fit.\n*   **CWE-1286**: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n    *   **Description**: The product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n    *   **Relevance**: This CWE is relevant because the input queries are not validated to ensure they conform to the expected structure, allowing bypass via removal of whitespace, carriage return, and line feed characters.\n    *   **Abstraction Level**: Base\n    *   **Usage**: Allowed\n*   **CWE-306**: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n    *   **Description**: The product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n    *   **Relevance**: Although the primary weakness is the improper input validation, a consequence of the vulnerability is unauthorized access, which could be related to missing authentication.\n    *   **Abstraction Level**: Base\n    *   **Usage**: Allowed",
