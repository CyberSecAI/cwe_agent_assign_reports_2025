The CVE description is a placeholder, but the content provides significantly more detail than a standard CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the \"username\" parameter in the `/admin/forgot-password.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized access to the database.\n*   Sensitive data leakage.\n*   Data tampering.\n*   Complete system control.\n*   Service disruption.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is exploitable via the \"username\" parameter in a POST request to `/admin/forgot-password.php`.\n*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Employ prepared statements and parameter binding.\n*   Conduct input validation and filtering.\n*   Minimize database user permissions.\n\n**Vulnerability details and POC:**\n\n*   **Vulnerable location:** \"username\" parameter\n*   **Payload:** `username=admin' AND (SELECT 3621 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))ZeLV) AND 'gJUi'='gJUi`\n*   **Vulnerability Request Packet:** (Full HTTP POST request provided in the content)\n*   **Tool used for testing:** sqlmap (screenshot provided)",

Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
