## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The first content (github.com) details a stack overflow vulnerability in the RE11S_1.11 router, specifically in the `setWAN` function. The vulnerability is triggered by the `pptpUserName` key value using `sprintf`, leading to a stack overflow. A proof-of-concept (PoC) Python script is provided to exploit the vulnerability.

Here's a breakdown of the information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when using `sprintf` with the `pptpUserName` input.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack overflow.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Potential for arbitrary code execution due to control flow hijacking.
*   **Attack vectors:** HTTP POST request to `/goform/setWAN` with a crafted `pptpUserName` value.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network access to the router's web interface.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** Not specified in the provided content.
