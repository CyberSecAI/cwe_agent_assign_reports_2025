# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-0203

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in code-projects Student Management System 1.0. It has been declared as critical. This vulnerability affects the function showSubject1 of the file /config/DbFunction.php. The manipulation of the argument sid leads to sql injection. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Other parameters might be affected as well.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** /config/DbFunction.php
- **weakness:** **weakness, sql injection**
- **product:** code-projects Student Management System
- **version:** 1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL Injection located in the `/config/DbFunction.php` file of a Student Management System.
- The `showSubject1` function directly embeds the `$sid` parameter into a SQL query without any sanitization, validation, or restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization which allows malicious SQL code to be injected via the `$sid` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by exploiting the SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Data Breach:** Sensitive data within the database can be accessed, modified, or deleted.
- **System Compromise:** The server could be fully compromised, potentially allowing for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTTP request that includes specially crafted SQL code within the `$sid` parameter of the `showSubject1` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Code:** The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable `showSubject1` function and the unsanitized `$sid` parameter.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the Student Management System.
- **Basic SQL injection skills**: The attacker should be aware of basic SQL injection concepts, such as creating SQL queries that can be executed in the database.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) indicates the potential for achieving RCE, highlighting the severity of the vulnerability.
- The vulnerable function `showSubject1` retrieves data from the `subject` table using the provided `subid`.
```php
function showSubject1($sid){

	$db = Database::getInstance();
	$mysqli = $db->getConnection();
	$query = "SELECT * FROM subject where subid='$sid' ";
	$stmt= $mysqli->query($query);
	return $stmt;

}
```
