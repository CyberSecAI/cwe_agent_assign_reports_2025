  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-5368 Content\n\nBased on the provided content, this relates to a SQL injection vulnerability.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user input for the \"todate\" parameter in the `/expense-yearwise-reports-detailed.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized access to the database.\n*   Sensitive data leakage.\n*   Data tampering.\n*   Complete system control.\n*   Service disruption.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The \"todate\" parameter in a POST request to `/dets/expense-yearwise-reports-detailed.php`.\n*   Boolean-based SQL injection techniques are demonstrated with example request packets.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is mentioned as a requirement in the provided content.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Employ prepared statements and parameter binding.\n*   Conduct input validation and filtering.\n*   Minimize database user permissions.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The content provides specific example request packets (both true and false conditions) demonstrating the vulnerability.\n*   The vulnerable file and parameter are clearly identified.\n*   The affected product and version are specified (phpgurukul Daily Expense Tracker Project V1.1).\n*   The content includes a suggested repair strategy with detailed steps.",

The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms the root cause as the lack of proper sanitization of user input, leading to the ability to inject malicious SQL code. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the most relevant CWE.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is based on the clear evidence in the vulnerability description and supporting information. The description states \"The manipulation of the argument todate leads to **sql injection**\". The content summary further clarifies that the root cause is the lack of sanitization of the `todate` parameter.
