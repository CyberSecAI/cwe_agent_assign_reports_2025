# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-37871

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved nfsd decrease sc_count directly if fail to queue dl_recall A deadlock warning occurred when invoking nfs4_put_stid following a failed dl_recall queue operation T1 T2 nfs4_laundromat nfs4_get_client_reaplist nfs4_anylock_blockers __break_lease spin_lock // ctx->flc_lock spin_lock // clp->cl_lock nfs4_lockowner_has_blockers locks_owner_has_blockers spin_lock // flctx->flc_lock nfsd_break_deleg_cb nfsd_break_one_deleg nfs4_put_stid refcount_dec_and_lock spin_lock // clp->cl_lock When a file is opened, an nfs4_delegation is allocated with sc_count initialized to 1, and the file_lease holds a reference to the delegation. The file_lease is then associated with the file through kernel_setlease. The disassociation is performed in nfsd4_delegreturn via the following call chain nfsd4_delegreturn --> destroy_delegation --> destroy_unhashed_deleg --> nfs4_unlock_deleg_lease --> kernel_setlease --> generic_delete_lease The corresponding sc_count reference will be released after this disassociation. Since nfsd_break_one_deleg executes while holding the flc_lock, the disassociation process becomes blocked when attempting to acquire flc_lock in generic_delete_lease. This means 1) sc_count in nfsd_break_one_deleg will not be decremented to 0 2) The nfs4_put_stid called by nfsd_break_one_deleg will not attempt to acquire cl_lock 3) Consequently, no deadlock condition is created. Given that sc_count in nfsd_break_one_deleg remains non-zero, we can safely perform refcount_dec on sc_count directly. This approach effectively avoids triggering deadlock warnings.

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE selected is CWE-833 (Deadlock), which is a Base level CWE. The vulnerability description clearly indicates a deadlock situation due to improper locking mechanisms and concurrent execution issues. CWE-667 (Improper Locking) and CWE-362 (Race Condition) are considered as related Class-level CWEs, representing potential contributing factors but not the direct root cause. The graph relationships were considered to ensure the chosen CWE was at the appropriate level of abstraction.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper locking** and **concurrent execution** leading to a **deadlock** condition.
  - **Root Cause:** Improper locking mechanisms, potentially stemming from a race condition.
  - **Weakness:** Failure to properly acquire or release locks, resulting in a deadlock.
  - **Impact:** Application hangs or becomes unresponsive due to the deadlock.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis indicates a deadlock condition in the Linux kernel's nfsd component. The primary evidence for this is the deadlock warning and the description of lock contention between different threads. The description states: "A **deadlock** warning occurred when invoking nfs4_put_stid following a failed dl_recall queue operation". The vulnerability occurs due to improper handling of locks when a file is opened and an nfs4_delegation is allocated. The evidence from the vulnerability description supports the selection of CWE-833 (Deadlock) as the primary CWE. While CWE-667 (Improper Locking) and CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) are related, they are more general and represent contributing factors rather than the direct root cause, which is the deadlock itself. Therefore, CWE-833 is the most specific and appropriate choice. The retriever results also support this conclusion, with CWE-833 being a highly ranked candidate.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-833: Deadlock
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in **deadlock**.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.
