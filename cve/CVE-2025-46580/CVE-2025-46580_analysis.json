The analysis focused on matching the CWE description to the vulnerability details provided. Abstraction levels were considered to choose the most accurate representation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe267[\"CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe267 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **code-related vulnerability** which allows attackers to access system tables. This can be mapped to **Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions** because the code allows access to system tables which should not be allowed.\n  - The root cause is the unsafe privilege.\n  - The impact is disruption of normal operation of business SQL.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the provided vulnerability description, particularly the phrases \"code-related vulnerability\" and \"access system tables.\" The lack of detailed information in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary significantly limited the scope of the analysis.\n\nThe selection of CWE-267 is primarily based on the description stating that attackers can access system tables, implying that the privileges defined for certain actions or roles within the GoldenDB database product are not secure, allowing unintended access.\n\nThe evidence is weak due to the high-level nature of the vulnerability description. More specific information about the **code-related vulnerability** would allow for a more precise CWE assignment.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
