  "description": "A vulnerability was found in PbootCMS up to 3.2.3. It has been classified as critical. This affects an unknown part of the file apps/home/controller/IndexController.php. The manipulation of the argument tag leads to **code injection**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 3.2.4 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.",

While the description indicates code injection, determining whether it is dynamically evaluated (CWE-95) or statically saved (CWE-96) would require more information.

The impact is remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the manipulation of the 'tag' argument leads to **code injection**. The retriever results suggest CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting), CWE-89 (SQL Injection), and CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine). However, these are not as directly relevant as CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')), which directly addresses the **code injection** aspect.\n\nThe evidence is the vulnerability description itself: \"The manipulation of the argument tag leads to **code injection**.\" This is direct evidence supporting the classification of CWE-94.\n\nCWE-94 is selected because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **improper control of code generation**. While other CWEs like CWE-79, CWE-89, and CWE-1336 might be related depending on the specific context of the injection, CWE-94 is the most accurate representation of the **root cause**. The other CWEs were considered but deemed less appropriate as they represent specific types of injection or impacts rather than the underlying cause.",
