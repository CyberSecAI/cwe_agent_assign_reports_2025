  "description": "In SAP NetWeaver Java (Software Update Manager 1.1), under certain conditions when a software upgrade encounters errors, credentials are written in plaintext to a log file. An attacker with local access to the server, authenticated as a non-administrative user, can acquire the credentials from the logs.

This leads to the **cleartext storage of sensitive information (CWE-312)**, which ultimately results in the **exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor (CWE-200)**. The root cause is the insecure logging practice.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly states that the vulnerability involves credentials being written in plaintext to a log file. This aligns directly with the description of **CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File**. The retriever results also list CWE-532 as the top candidate. While **CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** is also listed, it's a high-level impact rather than the root cause. The relationship graph shows that CWE-532 can precede CWE-200, indicating that the **insertion of sensitive information into the log file** leads to the **exposure of that information**. Therefore, **CWE-532** is the most appropriate and specific classification for this vulnerability. The vulnerability could also be seen as **CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information**, but CWE-532 provides more context of how it was stored.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
