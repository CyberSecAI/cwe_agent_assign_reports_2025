## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-25374 Content

The provided content **IS RELATED** to potential vulnerabilities in NASAâ€™s Core Flight System (cFS) version Aquila. It details a security assessment uncovering several critical vulnerabilities. The content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description would.

Here's an extraction of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Invalid Memory Access:**  The Memory Management Module (MM) does not properly validate memory addresses before reading or writing, relying on potentially misconfigured PSP memory tables.  Default OS configurations may announce the entire memory space as valid.
*   **Path Traversal in OSAL:** Improper validation of file paths allows writing files outside designated directories. The validation only checks for an exact match of the virtual mount point, not the absolute path.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via GOT Overwrite:**  The MM's functionalities, combined with a lack of full RELRO protection, allow overwriting entries in the Global Offset Table (GOT), enabling arbitrary code execution.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) on External Applications:** Inadequate cleanup mechanisms after application startup failures lead to resource exhaustion in the application table.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Insufficient memory address validation in MM functions (MM\_DumpMemToFileCmd, MM\_FillMemCmd, MM\_LoadMemFromFileCmd, MM\_LoadMemWIDCmd).
*   Improper file path validation in OSAL (OS\_TranslatePath).
*   Lack of full RELRO protection, allowing GOT overwrites.
*   Resource leaks in application startup failure handling.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** Application crashes, system instability, resource exhaustion preventing new application launches.
*   **Remote Code Execution:**  Arbitrary code execution on the system.
*   **File System Compromise:** Ability to write files to arbitrary locations, potentially overwriting critical system files.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Crafted MM commands (e.g., MM\_DumpMemToFileCmd, MM\_FillMemCmd) with invalid memory addresses.
*   Exploiting the path traversal vulnerability with crafted file paths.
*   Leveraging the GOT overwrite vulnerability by leaking addresses and manipulating the GOT.
*   Repeatedly attempting to start applications with invalid configurations to exhaust resources.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Ability to send commands to the cFS system.
*   Knowledge of the cFS architecture and MM functions.
*   Ability to debug and analyze memory addresses (for RCE).
*   Write access to certain files or directories (for path traversal).

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Memory Access Validation:** Ensure robust memory address validation before any memory access.  Properly configure PSP memory tables.
*   **Path Validation:** Implement proper file path validation, converting to absolute paths before checking against allowed directories.
*   **RELRO:** Compile with full RELRO to prevent GOT overwrites.
*   **Resource Cleanup:** Implement proper cleanup mechanisms for failed application startups to release resources.
*   **Authentication:** Implement authentication mechanisms to protect memory management functions.
