**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-48046
**CVE Description:** (Placeholder - as per instructions, the official description is missing)

**RELATION TO CVE:** RELATED

**Extracted Information:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of sufficient sanitization of input data, specifically the ‘`’ character, within multiple parameters in the NetFax server configuration.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Disclosure of default credentials.
    *   Disclosure of stored passwords in cleartext within configuration files.
    *   Command Injection (CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command).
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) as the root user.
    *   Compromise of network service accounts.
    *   Impact to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the server and application.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Exploitation via HTTP GET requests to access configuration files.
    *   Using default credentials (which are disclosed in cleartext).
    *   Injecting commands through unsanitized parameters.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Authenticated access (though default credentials facilitate automated exploitation).
    *   Network access to the NetFax server.
*   **Mitigation or fix:**
    *   Do not expose user credentials to the client.
    *   Redact sensitive information before displaying it to the client.
    *   Properly sanitize all input before use in system commands, specifically the ‘`’ character.
    *   Server-side validation of configuration settings.
    *   Change default device credentials.
    *   Restrict network access to the server.

**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**

*   The vulnerabilities affect MICI Network Co., Ltd’s NetFax server versions < 3.0.1.0.
*   The vendor has stated they will not address the vulnerability.
*   A Metasploit module is being developed for exploitation.
*   The Rapid7 team discovered the vulnerabilities during a penetration testing engagement.
*   CVSS score for CVE-2025-48046 is 4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N (Moderate - 5.3)
