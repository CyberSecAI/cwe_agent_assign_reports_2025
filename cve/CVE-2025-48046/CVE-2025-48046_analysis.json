The root cause is that the password is stored in plaintext. |\n| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The password is sent in cleartext over the network. |\n| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.4 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. Authentication is missing for the critical function of accessing the configuration endpoint. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-256, which describes storing passwords in plaintext. CWE-319 is a related weakness, where sensitive information is transmitted in cleartext, often a consequence of CWE-256. CWE-306 is also related, as the vulnerability can be exacerbated by a lack of authentication, which can lead to unauthorized access to the plaintext password.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe319 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe256\n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe256\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe319,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Plaintext Storage of a Password (CWE-256)**. This allows an authenticated user to retrieve the password. If there is **Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306)** for accessing the configuration endpoint, then any user could retrieve the password. Finally, the password is sent as **Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is that an authenticated user can disclose the cleartext password of a configured SMTP server via an HTTP GET request to the /config.php endpoint.\n\nThe primary weakness is **CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password**. The vulnerability description clearly states that the password is stored in cleartext. The retriever results also list CWE-256 as a possible match.\n\nThe vulnerability description also mentions an HTTP GET request, which implies that the password is being transmitted over the network. This suggests **CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information**. However, this is a secondary weakness, as the primary weakness is that the password is stored in plaintext in the first place.\n\nThe vulnerability description also mentions that an authenticated user can disclose the password. This suggests that there might be **CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function** or insufficient authentication for accessing the /config.php endpoint.\n\nI considered **CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials**, but it is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate.\nI considered **CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information**, but CWE-256 is more specific to passwords.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
