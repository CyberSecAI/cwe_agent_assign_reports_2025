# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-2754

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in Open Asset Import Library Assimp 5.4.3. It has been declared as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is the function AssimpAC3DImporterConvertObjectSection of the file code/AssetLib/AC/ACLoader.cpp of the component AC3D File Handler. The manipulation of the argument it leads to **heap-based buffer overflow**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap-based buffer overflow**
- **product:** Open Asset Import Library Assimp
- **version:** 5.4.3
- **component:** AC3D File Handler

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-2754 Content

The provided content details a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the Assimp library, specifically within the `Assimp::AC3DImporter::ConvertObjectSection` function when processing AC3D files.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability occurs due to an out-of-bounds write when processing `Surface::TriangleStrip` entries within the `ConvertObjectSection` function. The code iterates through surfaces and allocates memory for face indices.  The `vertices++` increment in the `TriangleStrip` processing section writes beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow.
*   **Improper Bounds Checking:** Lack of sufficient bounds checking when writing to the `vertices` buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution if an attacker can trick a victim into processing a specially crafted, malicious AC3D file.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious AC3D File:** An attacker crafts a malicious AC3D file that triggers the buffer overflow when processed by Assimp.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious AC3D file to a system that uses Assimp to process it. This could be through a file upload, a shared file, or any other means of delivering the file.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The provided content does not specify a fix, but the root cause analysis points to the need for improved bounds checking and memory management within the `Assimp::AC3DImporter::ConvertObjectSection` function.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** assimp >= 5.4.3
*   **CWEs:** CWE-119, CWE-787, CWE-122
*   **PoC:** A proof-of-concept (PoC) is provided, utilizing a fuzzer to trigger the bug. The PoC involves building Assimp with sanitizers and running a fuzzer against it.
*   The content is more detailed than a typical CVE description, providing code snippets, GDB output, and a detailed explanation of the vulnerability.
