# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-5814
## Query
A malicious TLS1.2 server can force a TLS1.3 client with downgrade capability to use a ciphersuite that it did not agree to and achieve a successful connection. This is because, aside from the extensions, the client was skipping fully parsing the server hello. https//doi.org/10.46586/tches.v2024.i1.457-500

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'client was skipping fully parsing the server hello'
