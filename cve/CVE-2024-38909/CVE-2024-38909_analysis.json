Copying files with unauthorized extensions can lead to the exposure of secrets and remote code execution (RCE).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates an **incorrect access control** issue where copying files with unauthorized extensions between server directories allows an attacker to expose secrets and perform RCE.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). The key phrase **\"incorrect access control\"** from the vulnerability description supports this classification, aligning with the guidance on Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control. The description indicates the application is performing authorization, but doing it incorrectly when copying files with unauthorized extensions.\n\nCWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) is considered because copying files with unauthorized extensions is mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n\nCWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) is considered because copying files between directories could involve path manipulation.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause (incorrect authorization) and potential consequences (file upload and path manipulation).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
