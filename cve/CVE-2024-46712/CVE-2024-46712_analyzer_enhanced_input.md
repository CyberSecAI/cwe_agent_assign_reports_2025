## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/vmwgfx Disable coherent dumb buffers without 3d Coherent surfaces make only sense if the host renders to them using accelerated apis. Without 3d the entire content of dumb buffers stays in the guest making all of the extra work theyre doing to synchronize between guest and host useless. Configurations without 3d also tend to run with very low graphics memory limits. The pinned console fb, mob cursors and graphical login manager tend to run out of 16MB graphics memory that those guests use. Fix it by making sure the coherent dumb buffers are only used on configs with 3d enabled.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **disable coherent dumb buffers without 3d**
- **impact:** useless extra work
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** drm/vmwgfx

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to a fix for a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's vmwgfx driver. Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that coherent dumb buffers were being used even in configurations where 3D acceleration was not enabled. This is problematic because the synchronization overhead introduced by coherent buffers is useless in such scenarios where the host is not rendering to them. Additionally, configurations without 3D support often have limited graphics memory, and the overhead of coherent buffers can exacerbate memory exhaustion issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Unnecessary Overhead:** Coherent dumb buffers were being used even when they provided no benefit, leading to unnecessary resource consumption.
-   **Memory Exhaustion:** In resource-constrained environments without 3D acceleration, the use of coherent dumb buffers could lead to graphics memory exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The exploitation of this issue primarily results in:
-  Resource waste due to unnecessary synchronization.
-  Possible denial of service scenarios due to graphics memory exhaustion.
- This is primarily a resource exhaustion issue rather than a code execution one.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector involves creating and utilizing dumb buffers in a virtualized environment without 3D support enabled. This doesn't require any special privileges but can potentially cause a denial of service if resources are exhausted

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker would need to be running a virtualized guest environment where 3D support is disabled.
-   The attacker must have the ability to create and use dumb buffers within the guest OS.

**Additional Details:**
The fix ensures that coherent dumb buffers are only utilized when 3D acceleration is enabled on the host.
The fix was introduced in commit `e9fd436bb8fb9b9d31fdf07bbcdba6d30290c5e4` and backported to stable kernels via commit `c45558414b8f2e0b9dc34eb8f9d4e8359b887681`
The vulnerability was reported by Christian Heusel.
