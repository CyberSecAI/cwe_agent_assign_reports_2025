  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/vmwgfx Disable coherent dumb buffers without 3d Coherent surfaces make only sense if the host renders to them using accelerated apis. Without 3d the entire content of dumb buffers stays in the guest making all of the extra work theyre doing to synchronize between guest and host useless. Configurations without 3d also tend to run with very low graphics memory limits. The pinned console fb, mob cursors and graphical login manager tend to run out of 16MB graphics memory that those guests use. Fix it by making sure the coherent dumb buffers are only used on configs with 3d enabled.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content relates to a fix for a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's vmwgfx driver. Here's a breakdown:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the fact that coherent dumb buffers were being used even in configurations where 3D acceleration was not enabled. This is problematic because the synchronization overhead introduced by coherent buffers is useless in such scenarios where the host is not rendering to them. Additionally, configurations without 3D support often have limited graphics memory, and the overhead of coherent buffers can exacerbate memory exhaustion issues.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n-   **Unnecessary Overhead:** Coherent dumb buffers were being used even when they provided no benefit, leading to unnecessary resource consumption.\n-   **Memory Exhaustion:** In resource-constrained environments without 3D acceleration, the use of coherent dumb buffers could lead to graphics memory exhaustion.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\nThe exploitation of this issue primarily results in:\n-  Resource waste due to unnecessary synchronization.\n-  Possible denial of service scenarios due to graphics memory exhaustion.\n- This is primarily a resource exhaustion issue rather than a code execution one.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\nThe attack vector involves creating and utilizing dumb buffers in a virtualized environment without 3D support enabled. This doesn't require any special privileges but can potentially cause a denial of service if resources are exhausted\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n-   The attacker would need to be running a virtualized guest environment where 3D support is disabled.\n-   The attacker must have the ability to create and use dumb buffers within the guest OS.\n\n**Additional Details:**\nThe fix ensures that coherent dumb buffers are only utilized when 3D acceleration is enabled on the host.\nThe fix was introduced in commit `e9fd436bb8fb9b9d31fdf07bbcdba6d30290c5e4` and backported to stable kernels via commit `c45558414b8f2e0b9dc34eb8f9d4e8359b887681`\nThe vulnerability was reported by Christian Heusel.",

CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400, representing a more specific case of uncontrolled resource consumption related to allocation without limits. Therefore, CWE-770 is preferred.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **rootcause**: using coherent dumb buffers without 3D support when it's not needed and causing unnecessary overhead. This leads to resource consumption, which can ultimately result in denial of service due to graphics memory exhaustion.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the **rootcause** of the vulnerability. The description and the CVE summary both pointed to the unnecessary allocation of resources (coherent dumb buffers) when they are not required, leading to resource exhaustion. The Retriever Results highlighted CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) as a strong candidate, which aligns well with the vulnerability description.\n\nThe relationship analysis further supported this choice, as CWE-770 is a more specific instance of the broader CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption). The decision to use CWE-770 is based on its greater specificity and alignment with the provided evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses or accesses a resource that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary.
