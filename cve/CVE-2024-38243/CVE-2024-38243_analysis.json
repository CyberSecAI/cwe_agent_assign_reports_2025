It is assigned when there is not enough information to map to a true CWE.\n\n## CWE-782: Exposed IOCTL with Insufficient Access Control\n**Technical Explanation:** The vulnerability involves an exposed IOCTL (Input/Output Control) interface without sufficient access control. This means that an attacker could potentially send commands to the kernel driver, bypassing security checks and potentially leading to privilege escalation.\n\n**Security Implications:** Exploiting this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges, potentially compromising the entire system.\n\n**Relationship Analysis:** CWE-782 is a variant of CWE-749 (Exposed Direct Memory Operation). It can be preceded by CWE-781 (Improper Address Validation in IOCTL with METHOD_NEITHER I/O Control Code).\n\n**Mapping Guidance Analysis:** The retriever results suggest CWE-782 as a possible candidate, but the evidence is too weak to confirm it definitively.\n\n\n## CWE Relationship Analysis\n\nCurrent CWEs represent these abstraction levels: .\n\n\n### Vulnerability Chain Analysis\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-782:**\n- 782 (Exposed IOCTL with Insufficient Access Control) - ROOT\n\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-781:**\n- 781 (Improper Address Validation in IOCTL with METHOD_NEITHER I/O Control Code) - ROOT\n\n\n\n### CWE Relationship Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n```",
