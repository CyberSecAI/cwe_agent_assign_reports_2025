  "description": "IrfanView DXF File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Read Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24617.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of DXF files within IrfanView. Specifically, the issue arises from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the DXF file.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Out-of-bounds read:  The lack of input validation allows a specially crafted DXF file to cause a read operation beyond the bounds of an allocated buffer.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Remote code execution: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current IrfanView process.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Malicious DXF file: An attacker can craft a malicious DXF file and deliver it to the victim.\n- User interaction required: The victim needs to either open a malicious DXF file directly or visit a webpage that triggers the processing of a malicious file.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious DXF file to the victim, either through a direct file transfer or indirectly through a website.\n- No special privileges are required since the exploit occurs in the context of the user running the application.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The vulnerability was fixed in IrfanView version 4.70 along with plugins version 4.70.\n- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2024-06-28, and a coordinated public release of the advisory took place on 2024-11-21.",

CWE-125 is a Base level CWE which accurately describes the weakness. CWE-20 is a Class level CWE and is too general, but it is still included because the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** is the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe125 -->|CAUSED_BY| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-20), which leads to an **out-of-bounds read** (CWE-125), and finally results in remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in an **out-of-bounds read**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms this by stating that the root cause of the vulnerability is the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** and the weakness is an **out-of-bounds read**.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) because the description mentions that the vulnerability can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. CWE-125 is a Base level CWE, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities. The Retriever Results also list CWE-125 as a potential candidate.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is included as a secondary CWE because the root cause is the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**. CWE-20 is a Class level CWE, which is a discouraged level of abstraction. However, it is still included to highlight the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) was considered because it was the Primary CWE Match for similar CVE Descriptions.
