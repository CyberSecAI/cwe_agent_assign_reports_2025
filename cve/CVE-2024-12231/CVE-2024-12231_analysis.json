  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in CodeZips Project Management System 1.0. This affects an unknown part of the file /index.php. The manipulation of the argument email leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  },
  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the `/index.php` file of the \"Project Management System In PHP And MYSQL With Source Code\". The `email` parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper escaping or parameterization, allowing for SQL injection.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability in the `/index.php` file. The application fails to sanitize or validate user-supplied data, specifically the 'email' parameter, before using it in SQL queries.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database, leading to:\n    - Sensitive data leakage\n    - Data tampering\n    - Comprehensive system control\n    - Service interruption.\n- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted HTTP POST requests with malicious SQL code in the 'email' parameter.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote, with no need for prior login or authorization. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.\n\nThe provided content provides more details than the official CVE description placeholder by detailing the vulnerable parameter, providing example payloads and showing the impact of the vulnerability.",
