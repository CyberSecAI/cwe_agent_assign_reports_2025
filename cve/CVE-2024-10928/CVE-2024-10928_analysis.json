  "description": "A vulnerability was found in MonoCMS up to 20240528. It has been declared as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file /monofiles/opensaved.php of the component Posts Page. The manipulation of the argument filtcategory/filtstatus leads to **cross site scripting**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `filtcategory` parameter from the URL is directly inserted into the value attribute of an HTML input element without proper sanitization.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user-supplied input.\n- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code, leading to the execution of malicious scripts in the victim's browser.\n- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the `filtcategory` GET parameter in the URL.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL with the malicious payload. No specific position is required, and the attacker can potentially distribute the malicious URL to victims through social engineering or other methods.\n\nThe provided content gives a detailed explanation and example of how the XSS vulnerability can be exploited, including the vulnerable code, injection payload, resulting HTML after injection, and steps to reproduce the vulnerability. It also gives a recommendation on how to fix the vulnerability using `htmlspecialchars()`.",

While CWE-80 is a child of CWE-79 and a more specific variant, the description indicates a general **cross site scripting** (**XSS**) vulnerability, making CWE-79 the more appropriate choice initially. The relationship data reinforces the relevance of CWE-79 as a root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe80[\"CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\"]\n\n    cwe80 -->|CHILDOF| cwe79\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe80 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of input and leads to **Cross-Site Scripting**.\n\nImproper Input Neutralization (CWE-79) -> Cross-Site Scripting\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified the root cause as the **improper neutralization** of input, which leads to a **Cross-Site Scripting** (**XSS**) vulnerability.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the manipulation of the `filtcategory/filtstatus` argument leads to **cross site scripting**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the `filtcategory` parameter is directly inserted into the HTML without proper sanitization, leading to the execution of malicious scripts in the victim's browser. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-79 as the primary candidate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-79 is based on the vulnerability's description, the evidence from the CVE reference links, and the retriever results.
