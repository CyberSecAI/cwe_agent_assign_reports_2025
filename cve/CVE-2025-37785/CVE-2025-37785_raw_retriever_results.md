# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-37785
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ext4 fix OOB read when checking dotdot dir Mounting a corrupted filesystem with directory which contains . dir entry with rec_len == block size results in out-of-bounds read (later on, when the corrupted directory is removed). ext4_empty_dir() assumes every ext4 directory contains at least . and .. as directory entries in the first data block. It first loads the . dir entry, performs sanity checks by calling ext4_check_dir_entry() and then uses its rec_len member to compute the location of .. dir entry (in ext4_next_entry). It assumes the .. dir entry fits into the same data block. If the rec_len of . is precisely one block (4KB), it slips through the sanity checks (it is considered the last directory entry in the data block) and leaves struct ext4_dir_entry_2 *de point exactly past the memory slot allocated to the data block. The following call to ext4_check_dir_entry() on new value of de then dereferences this pointer which results in out-of-bounds mem access. Fix this by extending __ext4_check_dir_entry() to check for . dir entries that reach the end of data block. Make sure to ignore the phony dir entries for checksum (by checking name_len for non-zero). Note This is reported by KASAN as use-after-free in case another structure was recently freed from the slot past the bound, but it is really an OOB read. This issue was found by syzkaller tool.
