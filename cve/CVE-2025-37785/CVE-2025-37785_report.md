# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-37785

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ext4 fix OOB read when checking dotdot dir Mounting a corrupted filesystem with directory which contains . dir entry with rec_len == block size results in out-of-bounds read (later on, when the corrupted directory is removed). ext4_empty_dir() assumes every ext4 directory contains at least . and .. as directory entries in the first data block. It first loads the . dir entry, performs sanity checks by calling ext4_check_dir_entry() and then uses its rec_len member to compute the location of .. dir entry (in ext4_next_entry). It assumes the .. dir entry fits into the same data block. If the rec_len of . is precisely one block (4KB), it slips through the sanity checks (it is considered the last directory entry in the data block) and leaves struct ext4_dir_entry_2 *de point exactly past the memory slot allocated to the data block. The following call to ext4_check_dir_entry() on new value of de then dereferences this pointer which results in out-of-bounds mem access. Fix this by extending __ext4_check_dir_entry() to check for . dir entries that reach the end of data block. Make sure to ignore the phony dir entries for checksum (by checking name_len for non-zero). Note This is reported by KASAN as **use-after-free** in case another structure was recently freed from the slot past the bound, but it is really an OOB read. This issue was found by syzkaller tool.

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |

*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the CWE selection was the hierarchical relationship. CWE-125, Out-of-bounds Read, is the direct result of dereferencing a pointer that points past the allocated memory, caused by a faulty length check on the '.' directory entry. While a **use-after-free** condition is reported, the root cause is the **out-of-bounds read**.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the incorrect calculation of the directory entry length, leading to the pointer arithmetic placing the pointer out of bounds. This out-of-bounds pointer is then dereferenced, causing an **out-of-bounds read**. In some cases, the memory past the boundary might have been recently freed leading to the KASAN report of **use-after-free**, however, the root cause remains the **out-of-bounds read**.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on the reported **use-after-free** condition. However, further analysis of the vulnerability description and the call trace clearly indicates that the root cause is an **out-of-bounds read** due to an incorrect directory entry length check. The "**use-after-free**" is a consequence of reading from memory that may have been recently freed, but the primary issue is accessing memory outside the allocated buffer.

The vulnerability description states: "Mounting a corrupted filesystem with directory which contains . dir entry with rec_len == block size results in **out-of-bounds read** (later on, when the corrupted directory is removed)." and "Note This is reported by KASAN as **use-after-free** in case another structure was recently freed from the slot past the bound, but it is really an **OOB read**." This evidence strongly supports the selection of CWE-125 as the primary weakness.

CWE-125 is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability based on the provided evidence.

## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 775.57
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
