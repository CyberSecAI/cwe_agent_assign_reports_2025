## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:**
* The vulnerability lies in the `/admin/search-appointment.php` file of the "Beauty Parlour Management System PHP SQLite Project".
* The `searchdata` parameter is used directly in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses:**
* **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. This is a classic SQL injection vulnerability.
* **Direct use of User Input in SQL:** The application directly incorporates user-provided data into SQL queries, which allows for manipulation of the query structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database.
*   **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Comprehensive System Control:**  In severe cases, the attacker could potentially gain control over the entire system.
*   **Service Interruption:** Attackers could disrupt or stop the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
* The attack vector is through the `searchdata` parameter in the `/admin/search-appointment.php` file.
* The vulnerability is accessible via a POST request, as indicated by the provided sqlmap payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need any login or authorization to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable URL and modify the `searchdata` parameter.

**Technical Details:**
*   The provided information includes a sample SQL injection payload:
     ```
     searchdata=11111' AND (SELECT 2483 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))ylwb)-- fdyi&search=
     ```
     This payload is a time-based blind SQL injection example, aiming to cause a delay.
   * A UNION based payload is also provided:
   ```
   searchdata=11111' UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,CONCAT(0x71766a7a71,0x776156536c644673674278675648557666574a4f794f7a794b4e526a43514647626b514d6f6d6269,0x71786b6b71),NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL-- -&search=
   ```
   This payload aims to extract data by injecting a UNION ALL statement.
*  The content also provides a sample sqlmap command, demonstrating the use of the tool to identify and exploit the vulnerability.
```
sqlmap -u "http://10.211.55.6:1112/admin/search-appointment.php" --data="searchdata=11111&search=" --cookie="PHPSESSID=590ushp8n3aqabqpe4p1cpmeov" --batch --level=5 --risk=3 --dbms=mysql --dbs --random-agent
```

**Mitigation:**
* The provided mitigation steps include:
    *   Using prepared statements and parameter binding.
    *   Input validation and filtering.
    *   Minimizing database user permissions.
    *   Regular security audits.

This information provides a good understanding of the SQL injection vulnerability and how it can be exploited.
