# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-47729

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 1.0 | Base | Primary CWE | Allowed |
| CWE-321 | Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key | 0.7 | Variant | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the parent-child relationship between CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) and CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information). CWE-312 is a more specific case of CWE-311. CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) was also considered as a secondary weakness, because the reference links mentioned hardcoded credentials.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **cleartext storage** of messages, which leads to the impact of exposing user data. The **hardcoded credentials** is a secondary issue that could lead to further compromise.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is the **cleartext storage** of sensitive information, which directly aligns with CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information). The vulnerability description explicitly states that the TeleMessage archiving backend holds **cleartext copies** of messages. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also confirms this by stating "The TeleMessage Signal clone app archived decrypted messages without re-encrypting them for storage." This is a direct instance of sensitive data being stored without encryption.

CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) was considered but not chosen as the primary CWE because CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is a more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. CWE-312 is a child of CWE-311, providing a more granular classification.

CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) was considered as a secondary issue because the CVE Reference Links Content Summary mentions "Source code for the messaging app contains hardcoded credentials among other vulnerabilities." This indicates a potential secondary weakness related to cryptographic key management.

The choice of CWE-312 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **cleartext storage** aspect of the vulnerability.
Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).



## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.
