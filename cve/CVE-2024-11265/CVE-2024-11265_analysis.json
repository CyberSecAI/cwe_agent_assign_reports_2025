  "description": "The Increase Maximum Upload File Size | Increase Execution Time plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.3. This is due to returning image upload error messages with full path information. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level permissions and above, to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-11265:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the plugin's handling of image upload error messages. Specifically, the plugin returns error messages that include the full server path to the uploaded file.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Full Path Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the web application's full path due to the inclusion of file system paths in error messages.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can obtain the full server path of the web application. This information, while not directly exploitable, can be valuable in reconnaissance for further attacks.\n- **Aid in other attacks:** The disclosed path information can be used to facilitate other attacks by revealing the location of important files. This vulnerability would need to be chained with another vulnerability for a successful attack.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- **Network:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely through HTTP requests with malicious image uploads.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a user with \"author\" level privileges or higher. This is due to the function `wmufs_ajax_chunk_receiver()` requiring the `upload_files` capability.\n- **Access to WordPress backend:** The attacker needs to be able to access the WordPress dashboard to trigger the upload functionality.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- The vulnerable code is located within the `wmufs_ajax_chunk_receiver` function in `/inc/class-wmufs-chunk-files.php`. The issue arises because when an error occurs, the function includes the full path in the error message sent back to the user.\n- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.1.4 of the plugin.\n- The vulnerability is described as a medium severity with a CVSS score of 4.3.",
