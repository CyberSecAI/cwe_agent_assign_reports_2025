The description indicates a general access control issue without specifying whether it's due to authentication or authorization. |\n| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.60 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary candidate. There is a mention of \"Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels\". |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship to consider here is the parent-child relationship between CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization). CWE-284 is a high-level category, while CWE-863 is a more specific class focusing on authorization. Since the vulnerability description mentions \"Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels\" this suggests that CWE-863 could be more appropriate. However, due to the lack of specific details, sticking with the more general CWE-284 is safer.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Improper Access Control** (CWE-284) which leads to the impact of \"Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels\".\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the provided vulnerability description, which points to an **Improper Access Control** issue. The retriever results and the authentication vs authorization vs access control guidance suggest considering CWE-284, CWE-863.\n\nThe selection of CWE-284 is based on the root cause **Improper Access Control** which is mentioned in the vulnerability description. However, \"Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels\" suggests that authorization might be the problem. Without further evidence about the root cause, CWE-284 is the most appropriate and safest choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
