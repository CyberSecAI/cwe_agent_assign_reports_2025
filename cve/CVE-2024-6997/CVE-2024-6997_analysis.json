This is a variant-level CWE, providing a specific description of the vulnerability. No parent or child relationships influenced the selection in this case as the description matches the CWE perfectly.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe416 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **use-after-free** condition, which allows a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states \"**Use after free** in Tabs\", which directly corresponds to **CWE-416 (Use After Free)**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirms this by stating \"**Root cause:** Use-after-free in Tabs.\" and \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Use-after-free\". This direct evidence supports a high confidence level in the mapping to **CWE-416**. The other CWEs identified by the retriever are not directly supported by the description. **CWE-416** is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly describes the **rootcause** of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-416: Use After Free\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory \"belongs\" to the code that operates on the new pointer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed. This is often a component in phishing attacks.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.

This is a variant-level CWE, providing a specific description of the vulnerability. No parent or child relationships influenced the selection in this case as the description matches the CWE perfectly.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe416 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **use-after-free** condition, which allows a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states \"**Use after free** in Tabs\", which directly corresponds to **CWE-416 (Use After Free)**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirms this by stating \"**Root cause:** Use-after-free in Tabs.\" and \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Use-after-free\". This direct evidence supports a high confidence level in the mapping to **CWE-416**. The other CWEs identified by the retriever are not directly supported by the description. **CWE-416** is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly describes the **rootcause** of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-416: Use After Free\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory \"belongs\" to the code that operates on the new pointer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nIf two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
