Several base-level CWEs could be considered children of this class. CWE-941 [Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel] and CWE-923 [Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints] are related to the vulnerability.

This leads to the ability for a malicious remote to **set arbitrary RemoteId values for synced users**.\n\nCWE-346 (Root Cause) -> Impact: Setting arbitrary RemoteId values.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **failure to validate the source of sync messages**. The best fit is CWE-346 [Origin Validation Error], as it directly addresses the **lack of proper verification of the data source**. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the system \"fail[s] to validate the source of sync messages.\"\n\nCWE-941 [Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel] is also relevant, as it describes the **incorrect specification of the destination**, which is related to origin validation. However, CWE-346 is a more appropriate high-level classification.\n\nCWE-923 [Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints] is also relevant, as the communication channel is not properly restricted to the intended endpoints. This could be considered a broader category that includes the specific origin validation failure.\n\nThe selection of CWE-346 is based on the evidence from the vulnerability description: \"Mattermost versions 9.9.x <= 9.9.0 and 9.5.x <= 9.5.6 **fail to validate the source of sync messages** and only allow the correct remote IDs, which allows a malicious remote to set arbitrary RemoteId values for synced users and therefore claim that a user was synced from another remote.\"\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-346 providing a general classification and CWE-941 and CWE-923 providing more specific details about the vulnerability.\n\nOther CWEs Considered but Not Used:\n\n*   CWE-639 [Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key]: While the vulnerability allows setting arbitrary RemoteId values, it's primarily an origin validation issue rather than a direct authorization bypass through a user-controlled key.\n*   CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization]: Similar to CWE-639, the root cause is not primarily an authorization issue.\n*   CWE-347 [Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature]: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability does not involve cryptographic signatures.\n*   CWE-287 [Improper Authentication]: While related, the vulnerability is more about validating the origin of messages than a general authentication failure.\n*   CWE-1286 [Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input]: The issue is not about the syntactic correctness of the input, but the validity of the source.\n*   CWE-789 [Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value]: This CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-116 [Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output]: This CWE is not relevant to the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-322 [Key Exchange without Entity Authentication]: This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability does not involve key exchange.",
