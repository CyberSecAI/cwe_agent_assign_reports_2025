There aren't more specific CWEs supported by the evidence. This CWE sits at the top of an access control hierarchy, making it less specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe284 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves **data exfiltration** due to **improper access control**. The initial flaw is the lack of proper restrictions, leading to the impact of sensitive data being accessed by unauthorized apps.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the AAT application is vulnerable to data exfiltration due to **improper access control**. The vulnerability description and CVE reference links support the assessment that malicious apps can read data from AAT, including geolocations because of a **weakness** in access control. The retriever results suggest CWE-284 as a relevant candidate, although it is discouraged as it is a Pillar level CWE.
