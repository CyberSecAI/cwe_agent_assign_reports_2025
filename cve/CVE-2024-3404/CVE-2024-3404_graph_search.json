This flaw allows an authenticated attacker to bypass intended access restrictions and read the `history` files of other users, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information. The vulnerability is present in the applications handling of access control for the `history` path, where no adequate mechanism is in place to prevent an authenticated user from accessing another users chat history files. This issue poses a significant risk as it could allow attackers to obtain sensitive information from the chat history of other users. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-863 CWE-639 CWE-790 CWE-285 CWE-668 CWE-267 CWE-284 CWE-287 CWE-532",
