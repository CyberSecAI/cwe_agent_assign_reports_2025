This leads to predictable password hashes and ultimately a compromised authentication mechanism.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the explicit statement in the vulnerability description: \"DBIxClassEncodedColumn use the rand() function, which is not cryptographically secure to salt password hashes.\" This directly corresponds to **CWE-338 (Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG))**.\n\nThe retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-338 as a candidate.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but deemed less applicable. **CWE-330 (Use of Insufficiently Random Values)** is a more general class, and **CWE-338** is a more specific instance of this class.
