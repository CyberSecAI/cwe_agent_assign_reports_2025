  "description": "A vulnerability has been found in didi DDMQ 1.0 and classified as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the component Console Module. The manipulation with the input /login leads to **improper authentication**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This product takes the approach of rolling releases to provide continious delivery. Therefore, version details for affected and updated releases are not available. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
