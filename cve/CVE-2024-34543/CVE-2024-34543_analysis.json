It specifies that the attack vector is local (AV:L), the attack complexity is high (AC:H), the required privileges are low (PR:L), user interaction is required (UI:R) the scope is unchanged (S:U) and the impact to confidentiality, integrity and availability is high (C:H/I:H/A:H).\n- Intel has discontinued the RAID Web Console software and will not release updates to mitigate this vulnerability. They recommend migrating to newer generation products.",

The relationship indicates that the authorization mechanism is present but flawed. The choice of CWE-863 is more specific than CWE-284, as the description clearly states that there's **improper access control**, suggesting that authorization checks are happening, but incorrectly.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control**, specifically an incorrect authorization mechanism (CWE-863). This leads to privilege escalation, allowing an authenticated user to gain higher privileges than intended.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the provided information, particularly the vulnerability description's key phrase \"**improper access control**\" and the summary's root cause description. The retriever results highlighted several potential CWEs, including CWE-691, CWE-284, and CWE-269. However, the guidance on Authentication vs. Authorization vs. Access Control, along with the Privileges vs. Permissions guidance, helped refine the selection.\n\nThe description states that \"Improper access control in Intel(R) RAID Web Console software for all versions may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\" This suggests that the software is attempting to control access, but doing so incorrectly. This points to an authorization issue rather than a complete lack of access control or authentication.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a Class-level CWE, and the mapping guidance suggests it should be reviewed to see if a more specific Base-level CWE exists. However, based on the information available, CWE-863 appears to be the most accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-284 (Improper Access Control) was considered as a more general option, but the detail of incorrect access control points more directly to CWE-863.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
