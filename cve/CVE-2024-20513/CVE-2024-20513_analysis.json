  "description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server of Cisco Meraki MX and Cisco Meraki Z Series Teleworker Gateway devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition for targeted users of the AnyConnect service on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to **insufficient entropy** for handlers that are used during SSL VPN session establishment. An unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by brute forcing valid session handlers. An authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the AnyConnect VPN service of an affected device to retrieve a valid session handler and, based on that handler, predict further valid session handlers. The attacker would then send a crafted HTTPS request using the brute-forced or predicted session handler to the AnyConnect VPN server of the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to terminate targeted SSL VPN sessions, forcing remote users to initiate new VPN connections and reauthenticate.",

CWE-330 is a Class-level CWE, however, there does not appear to be a more specific Base or Variant CWE that directly addresses the **insufficient entropy** issue described. CWE-400 was considered because the impact is a DoS, however, the root cause is the lack of entropy rather than a failure to limit resource consumption directly.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe330[\"CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe330 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient entropy** (CWE-330), leading to predictable session handlers. Attackers can then exploit these predictable session handlers to send crafted HTTPS requests, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) (CWE-400) by terminating user sessions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description and CVE summary clearly point to **insufficient entropy** as the primary issue. The retriever results suggested several CWEs related to authentication and input validation, but these did not directly address the entropy problem.\n\nCWE-330, \"Use of Insufficiently Random Values,\" was selected as the primary CWE because it best captures the essence of the **insufficient entropy** issue. While it is a Class-level CWE, there isn't a more specific CWE available.\n\nCWE-400, \"Uncontrolled Resource Consumption,\" was considered as a secondary CWE due to the DoS impact. However, it's more of a consequence of the root cause (CWE-330) rather than a primary weakness.\n\nThe graph relationships were considered to understand the connections between the different CWEs, but the hierarchical relationship influenced the decision to stick with CWE-330 as the primary CWE. The level of specificity is optimal because there's no more specific CWE that directly addresses the **insufficient entropy** issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThis attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
