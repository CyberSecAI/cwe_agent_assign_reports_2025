# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-32948

## Vulnerability Description
The vulnerability allows any attacker to cause the PeerTube server to stop functioning, or in special cases send requests to arbitrary URLs (Blind SSRF). Attackers can send ActivityPub activities to PeerTubes inbox endpoint. By abusing the Create Activity functionality, it is possible to create crafted playlists which will cause either denial of service or an attacker-controlled blind SSRF.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** Create Activity functionality
- **vector:** crafted playlists
- **weakness:** **blind SSRF, request injection, SSRF**
- **product:** PeerTube
- **impact:** denial of service, stop PeerTube server, send requests to arbitrary URLs
- **attacker:** any attacker

## Analysis of CVE-2025-32948 Content

Here's an analysis of the provided content, focusing on CVE-2025-32948 as described in the initial prompt (PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval).  Since the CVE description is a placeholder, the analysis relies on the details provided in the content.

**1. Verification:**

The content from both `github.com` and `research.jfrog.com` directly relates to CVE-2025-32948. The GitHub release notes explicitly mention the CVE and link to the JFrog vulnerability report. The JFrog report details the vulnerability.

**2. Extracted Information:**

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details, extracted from the provided content:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    *   PeerTube's ActivityPub playlist creation process doesn't properly sanitize input, specifically the `url` field within ActivityPub objects.
    *   The `fetchElementUrls`, `rebuildVideoPlaylistElements`, `buildElementsDBAttributes`, and `fetchRemotePlaylistElement` functions are involved in processing the playlist elements.
    *   The `got` library is used for fetching remote resources, and improper handling of objects in the `url` field allows for manipulation of `got`'s options (e.g., enabling Unix sockets).
    *   Lack of proper error handling in the `_destroy` function of `got` leads to server crashes.
    *   The search functionality (`/api/v1/search/video-channels`) can be exploited if remote URI searching is enabled.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
    *   Denial of Service (DoS)
    *   Improper Input Validation
    *   Lack of Error Handling

*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **DoS:**  The server can be crashed, rendering it unavailable.
    *   **SSRF:** An attacker can potentially make the server send requests to arbitrary internal or external URLs, potentially accessing sensitive resources.

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Crafted ActivityPub Create Activities with malicious `url` fields.
    *   Exploiting the `/api/v1/search/video-channels` endpoint with a malicious URL when remote URI searching is enabled.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   An attacker needs to be able to send ActivityPub Create Activities to the PeerTube instance (e.g., through federation).
    *   For the search endpoint exploit, the attacker needs to be an authenticated user with permission to search remote URIs.

*   **Mitigation or fix:**
    *   The content states "No mitigations are supplied for this issue" but links to a release (v7.1.1) that fixes the vulnerability.  The release notes indicate the vulnerability is fixed in v7.1.1.

**3. Additional Details (Compared to a Placeholder CVE Description):**

The JFrog report provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description would. It includes:

*   A detailed explanation of the code flow leading to the vulnerability.
*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the exploit.
*   Specific function names involved.
*   Information about the configuration option (`search.remote_uri`) that affects the attack surface.
*   A link to PoC materials.

**4. Unrelated Content:**

The content from `twitter.com` and the initial GitHub page content (regarding features, pricing, etc.) are unrelated to the vulnerability and have been excluded. The GitHub page error messages are also unrelated.

**In summary, the provided content is highly relevant to CVE-2025-32948 and provides a comprehensive description of the vulnerability, its impact, and potential attack vectors.**
