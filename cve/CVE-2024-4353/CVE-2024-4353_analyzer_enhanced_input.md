# Vulnerability Description

    Concrete CMS versions 9.0.0 through 9.3.2 are affected by a stored **XSS vulnerability** in the generate dashboard board instance functionality. The Name input field **does not check the input sufficiently** letting a rogue administrator have the capability to inject malicious JavaScript code. The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v3.1 score of 3.1 with a vector of AVN/ACH/PRH/UIR/SU/CL/IL/AN https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator and a CVSS v4 score of 1.8 with a vector of CVSS4.0/AVN/ACH/ATN/PRH/UIA/VCL/VIL/VAN/SCN/SIN/SAN Concrete versions below 9 are not affected by this vulnerability. Thanks fhAnso for reporting.
