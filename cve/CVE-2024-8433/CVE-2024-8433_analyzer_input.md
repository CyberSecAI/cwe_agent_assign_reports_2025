# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-8433

# Vulnerability Description

    The Easy Mega Menu Plugin for WordPress - ThemeHunk plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the themehunk_megamenu_bg_image parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.0 due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. Please note that this was partially fixed in 1.1.0 due to the **missing authorization** protection that was added.
