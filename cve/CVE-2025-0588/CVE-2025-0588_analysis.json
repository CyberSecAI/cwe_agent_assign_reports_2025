By submitting a specifically crafted referrer header the user could ensure that all subsequent server responses would return 500 errors rendering the site mostly unusable. The user would be able to subsequently set and unset the referrer header to control the denial of service state with a valid CSRF token whilst new CSRF tokens could not be generated.",

By submitting a specifically crafted referrer header, the user could cause all subsequent server responses to return 500 errors.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Improper input validation (specifically of the Referrer header)\n*   Denial of Service (DoS)\n*   Potential for CSRF exploitation (controlling the DoS state with a CSRF token, but new tokens cannot be generated during the DoS)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nRendering the Octopus Server mostly unusable by causing 500 errors on all requests.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   A user with sufficient access submitting a crafted `Referrer` header.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   User with sufficient access to set custom headers.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade Octopus Server to version 2024.4.7091 or higher.\n*   Alternatively, upgrade to 2024.3.13097 or greater if unable to upgrade to 2024.4.7132. Specific upgrade paths are provided for older versions (2020.x, 2021.x, 2022.x, 2023.x, 2024.1.x, 2024.2.x, 2024.3.x, 2024.4.x).\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   Discovery Date: 18 NOV 2024\n*   Patch Release Date: 22 JAN 2025\n*   Advisory Release Date: 10 FEB 2025\n*   CVSS Score: 5.9\n*   The vulnerability was found by Edward Prior (@JankhJankh).\n*   No known mitigation other than upgrading.\n*   The Octopus Deploy security team is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability.",

This leads to **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)** because the server attempts to process the invalid header, resulting in 500 errors and a denial of service.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n1.  **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)**: The server fails to validate the crafted Referrer header.\n2.  **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)**: The server attempts to process the invalid header, leading to 500 errors.\n3.  **Denial of Service (DoS)**: The server becomes mostly unusable due to the continuous 500 errors.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability stems from the server's failure to properly validate the Referrer header, leading to a denial of service. The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference, which clearly indicates the **improper input validation** as the root cause and the resulting denial of service as the impact.\n\n**CWE-20 Improper Input Validation** is the primary CWE because the root cause of the vulnerability lies in the **lack of proper validation of the referrer header**. This allows an attacker to inject a crafted header that leads to server errors. The evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary directly supports this: \"**Improper input validation (specifically of the Referrer header)**\".\n\n**CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** is a secondary CWE because the **improperly validated input leads to excessive resource consumption** as the server generates 500 errors for all requests. This is a direct consequence of the **improper input validation** and contributes to the denial-of-service condition.\n\nThe graph relationships and chain analysis confirm that CWE-20 is the root cause that leads to CWE-400 and ultimately the denial of service. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause and the direct impact of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-610: Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an externally controlled name or reference that resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
