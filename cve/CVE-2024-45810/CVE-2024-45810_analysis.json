  "description": "Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. Envoy will crash when the http async client is handling `sendLocalReply` under some circumstance, e.g., websocket upgrade, and requests mirroring. The http async client will crash during the `sendLocalReply()` in http async client, one reason is http async client is duplicating the status code, another one is the destroy of router is called at the destructor of the async stream, while the stream is deferred deleted at first. There will be problems that the stream decoder is destroyed but its reference is called in `router.onDestroy()`, causing segment fault. This will impact ext_authz if the `upgrade` and `connection` header are allowed, and request mirrorring. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.31.2, 1.30.6, 1.29.9, and 1.28.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A crash occurs in the Envoy HTTP async client due to a double status code issue and the destruction of the router at the destructor of the async stream while the stream is deferred deleted. The stream decoder is destroyed, but its reference is called in `router.onDestroy()`, causing a segfault.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Double status code issue in HTTP async client, incorrect lifecycle management of async streams leading to use-after-free, which causes the stream decoder to be destroyed prematurely, resulting in a segfault when `router.onDestroy()` attempts to access the destroyed decoder.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** Envoy will crash, interrupting service and traffic processing.\n- **Attack vectors:** Sending a WebSocket upgrade request when `upgrade` and `connection` headers are allowed and request mirroring is enabled. The authentication server must then return a 400 error code to trigger the crash.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to an Envoy instance configured to allow `upgrade` and `connection` headers, with request mirroring enabled. The attacker also needs to send a WebSocket upgrade request that is rejected by an authentication server (resulting in a 400 response), leading to a crash of the Envoy instance.",

It occurs because the stream decoder is destroyed prematurely but its reference is later called in `router.onDestroy()`.\nCWE-416 is a child of CWE-560: Use of Functionality with Incompatible Security Levels and CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference.\n**Improper Control of Resource Consumption (CWE-664)** is a class-level CWE, considered as a secondary weakness, related to the resource management aspect of the vulnerability, where the Envoy proxy crashes due to **improper object destruction**, leading to excessive resource consumption due to the crash itself.\nThe relationship between CWE-416 and other CWEs are mainly related to the timing and the state of the objects.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    cwe560[\"CWE-560: Use of Functionality with Incompatible Security Levels\"]\n    cwe825[\"CWE-825: Expired Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe560\n    cwe416 -->|CHILDOF| cwe825\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe416 primary\n    class cwe560,cwe825,cwe664 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper object destruction** (manifested as premature destruction of the stream decoder). This leads to a use-after-free condition when `router.onDestroy()` attempts to access the destroyed decoder, resulting in a crash.\nThe chain is: **Improper Object Destruction** -> **Use After Free** (CWE-416) -> **Crash**.\nThe crash could also be seen as **Improper Control of Resource Consumption** (CWE-664).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-416, representing the use-after-free condition caused by the premature destruction of the stream decoder. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary clearly indicates this condition, where the decoder is destroyed, and a reference to it is later called, leading to a crash.\nCWE-664 is considered as a secondary CWE because the crash leads to resource consumption.\nThe Retriever Results listed CWE-770, CWE-789, and others. However, these are less relevant than CWE-416. CWE-770 and CWE-789 relate to resource allocation, which isn't the primary issue here. The core of this issue is the premature destruction of an object that is still referenced, leading to a use-after-free condition and a crash.\nCWE-416 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the use-after-free condition, which is the root cause of the crash.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
