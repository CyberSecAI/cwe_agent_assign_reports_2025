  "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Duo Epic for Hyperdrive could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view sensitive information in cleartext on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to **improper storage of an unencrypted registry key**. A low-privileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability by viewing or querying the registry key on the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive information in cleartext.",

This is appropriate because the vulnerability involves storing sensitive information in cleartext in a registry key. No parent-child or chain relationships influenced this decision, as the evidence clearly points to this specific weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe312 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-312 **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information** due to **improper storage of an unencrypted registry key**.\n2.  **Impact:** View sensitive information in cleartext.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly indicates that the root cause of the vulnerability is the **improper storage of an unencrypted registry key**, leading to the ability to view sensitive information in cleartext.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states: \"This vulnerability is due to **improper storage of an unencrypted registry key**.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also supports this, stating: \"Root cause of vulnerability: Improper storage of an unencrypted registry key.\"\n\nCWE-312 **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information** is the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **improper storage of an unencrypted registry key**, which is the root cause of the vulnerability.

CWE-312 **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information** is more specific.\n*   CWE-256 **Plaintext Storage of a Password**: This CWE is specific to passwords, while the vulnerability description refers to sensitive information in general.\n*   CWE-522 **Insufficiently Protected Credentials**: This CWE is about credentials, whereas the vulnerability is about sensitive information in general.\n*   CWE-319 **Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information**: This CWE is about transmission, whereas the vulnerability is about storage.\n*   CWE-321 **Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key**: This CWE is specific to cryptographic keys, not general sensitive information.",
