## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-4742 Content

This content **IS RELATED** to a vulnerability. It provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `torch.load` function is used without the `weights_only=True` parameter when loading a training state from a checkpoint file. This allows for the deserialization of untrusted data contained within a pickle structure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The use of `torch.load` without proper safeguards allows for the execution of arbitrary code embedded within a malicious pickle file.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized access to system resources.
*   Data theft.
*   System compromise (e.g., backdoor access).
*   Modification of important configuration files.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker replaces a legitimate "training\_state.pt" file with a malicious one.
*   The malicious file contains Python code embedded within the pickle data structure.
*   When `torch.load` is called, the malicious code is deserialized and executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to write to the directory specified by `model_name_or_path` to replace the legitimate checkpoint file.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Use `torch.load` with the `weights_only=True` parameter to prevent the deserialization of arbitrary code. This ensures that only the model weights are loaded, and any potentially malicious code within the pickle data is ignored.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The issue is present in all versions of the affected software.
*   Specific code location is provided: `<https://github.com/XU-YIJIE/grpo-flat/blob/main/grpo_vanilla.py#L212C1-L222C1>`
*   A detailed explanation of the exploit process is given, including how an attacker would create and deploy the malicious file.
