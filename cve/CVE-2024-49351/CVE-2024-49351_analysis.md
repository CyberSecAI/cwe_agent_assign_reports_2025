# Analysis for CVE-2024-49351

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-256 | Plaintext Storage of a Password | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-522 | Insufficiently Protected Credentials | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the decision is that CWE-256 is a more specific type of CWE-522. CWE-256 is a Base level CWE, while CWE-522 is a Class level CWE. The vulnerability description clearly indicates that passwords are being stored in plaintext, which makes CWE-256 the more precise classification.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain is straightforward: the **root cause** is **plaintext storage of user credentials** (CWE-256), which directly leads to the impact of a local user being able to read those credentials.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis correctly identified CWE-256 as a strong candidate based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly states that user credentials are stored in plaintext. The retriever results also ranked CWE-256 as the top candidate. This assessment is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The graph relationships show that CWE-256 is a child of CWE-522, which represents a broader category of insufficiently protected credentials. Given the specificity of the description, CWE-256 is the optimal choice.

The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-523: Unprotected Transport of Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Login pages do not use adequate measures to protect the user name and password while they are in transit from the client to the server.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
