## Vulnerability Description
The Collapsing Categories plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the taxonomy parameter of the /wp-json/collapsing-categories/v1/get REST API in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.8 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**
- **weakness:** **SQL injection**
- **impact:** extract sensitive information from the database and information disclosure
- **vector:** taxonomy parameter
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **product:** Collapsing Categories plugin for WordPress
- **version:** all versions up to and including 3.0.8
- **component:** /wp-json/collapsing-categories/v1/get REST API

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and lack of proper SQL query preparation within the Collapsing Categories WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `taxonomy` parameter within the `/wp-json/collapsing-categories/v1/get` REST API endpoint is not adequately handled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw. The plugin fails to properly sanitize the `taxonomy` parameter received through the REST API before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** User-supplied data, specifically the `taxonomy` parameter, is not sufficiently sanitized or escaped before being incorporated into a database query.
*   **Insufficient Query Preparation:** The existing SQL query lacks sufficient preparation, making it susceptible to manipulation via injected SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the WordPress database by injecting malicious SQL queries designed to reveal database contents.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful exploitation could also allow attackers to perform other database related attacks, potentially gaining control of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **REST API Endpoint:** The attack vector is the `/wp-json/collapsing-categories/v1/get` REST API endpoint.
*   **`taxonomy` Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is the `taxonomy` parameter passed to the REST API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers, meaning no prior access to the website is required.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress website to send requests to the REST API endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the Collapsing Categories plugin up to and including 3.0.8.
*   The patched version is 3.0.9, which addresses this SQL injection issue by removing the REST API.
*   The provided changeset on the WordPress plugins repository ([plugins.trac.wordpress.org](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3201979%40collapsing-categories&new=3201979%40collapsing-categories&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=)) shows the removal of the vulnerable REST API endpoint.
