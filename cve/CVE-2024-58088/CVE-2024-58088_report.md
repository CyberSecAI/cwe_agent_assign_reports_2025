# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-58088

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved bpf Fix deadlock when freeing cgroup storage The following commit bc235cdb423a (bpf Prevent deadlock from recursive bpf_task_storage_[get|delete]) first introduced deadlock prevention for fentry/fexit programs attaching on bpf_task_storage helpers. That commit also employed the logic in map free path in its v6 version. Later bpf_cgrp_storage was first introduced in c4bcfb38a95e (bpf Implement cgroup storage available to non-cgroup-attached bpf progs) which faces the same issue as bpf_task_storage, instead of its busy counter, NULL was passed to bpf_local_storage_map_free() which opened a window to cause deadlock (acquiring local_storage->lock) _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x3d/0x50 bpf_local_storage_update+0xd1/0x460 bpf_cgrp_storage_get+0x109/0x130 bpf_prog_a4d4a370ba857314_cgrp_ptr+0x139/0x170 ? __bpf_prog_enter_recur+0x16/0x80 bpf_trampoline_6442485186+0x43/0xa4 cgroup_storage_ptr+0x9/0x20 (holding local_storage->lock) bpf_selem_unlink_storage_nolock.constprop.0+0x135/0x160 bpf_selem_unlink_storage+0x6f/0x110 bpf_local_storage_map_free+0xa2/0x110 bpf_map_free_deferred+0x5b/0x90 process_one_work+0x17c/0x390 worker_thread+0x251/0x360 kthread+0xd2/0x100 ret_from_fork+0x34/0x50 ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30 Progs - A SEC(fentry/cgroup_storage_ptr) - cgid (BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH) Record the id of the cgroup the current task belonging to in this hash map, using the address of the cgroup as the map key. - cgrpa (BPF_MAP_TYPE_CGRP_STORAGE) If current task is a kworker, lookup the above hash map using function parameter @owner as the key to get its corresponding cgroup id which is then used to get a trusted pointer to the cgroup through bpf_cgroup_from_id(). This trusted pointer can then be passed to bpf_cgrp_storage_get() to finally trigger the deadlock issue. - B SEC(tp_btf/sys_enter) - cgrpb (BPF_MAP_TYPE_CGRP_STORAGE) The only purpose of this prog is to fill Prog As hash map by calling bpf_cgrp_storage_get() for as many userspace tasks as possible. Steps to reproduce - Run A - while (true) { Run B Destroy B } Fix this issue by passing its busy counter to the free procedure so it can be properly incremented before storage/smap locking.

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-476 | NULL Pointer Dereference | 0.8 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-667 | Improper Locking | 0.6 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-833 | Deadlock | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-476 **NULL Pointer Dereference**, which directly relates to the stated **rootcause**. The secondary weaknesses, CWE-667 **Improper Locking** and CWE-833 **Deadlock**, are related to the impact of the **null pointer dereference** leading to a **deadlock** situation during the locking process.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **null pointer dereference** (CWE-476) when a **NULL** value is passed to `bpf_local_storage_map_free()`. This then leads to **improper locking** (CWE-667) when the system tries to acquire a lock on the **NULL** `local_storage` object. Finally, this **improper locking** results in a **deadlock** (CWE-833).

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions a **rootcause** of "**null pointer dereference**" and an impact of "**deadlock**". The retriever results also point to related CWEs like **Improper Locking** and **Deadlock**, which support the classification.

The primary CWE selected is CWE-476 **NULL Pointer Dereference** as that is the **rootcause** as explicitly mentioned in the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases. The vulnerability description states "...NULL was passed to bpf_local_storage_map_free() which opened a window to cause **deadlock** (acquiring local_storage->lock)...". This led to the selection of CWE-667 **Improper Locking** because the system attempts to acquire a lock on a resource `local_storage` that is **NULL**, and CWE-833 **Deadlock** as that is the ultimate impact of the **null pointer dereference**.

Other CWEs considered were:
*   CWE-367 **Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition**: While concurrency is involved, the primary issue isn't a race condition but a **null pointer dereference**.
*   CWE-404 **Improper Resource Shutdown or Release**: This is related, but the core issue is not the release of a resource but the attempt to operate on a **NULL** resource.
*   CWE-755 **Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions**: While a **null pointer** is an exceptional condition, CWE-476 is a more precise classification.
*   CWE-909 **Missing Initialization of Resource**: Though initialization is a factor, the direct cause is passing a **NULL** value, making CWE-476 a better fit.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-476 is a Base-level CWE that accurately describes the **rootcause**. CWE-667 and CWE-833 describe the resulting issues from the primary weakness.

The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-833: Deadlock
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL.

- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense
