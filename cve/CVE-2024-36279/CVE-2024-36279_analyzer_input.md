# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-36279

## Vulnerability Description
Reliance on obfuscation or encryption of security-relevant inputs without integrity checking issue exists in FreeFrom - the nostr client App versions prior to 1.3.5 for Android and iOS. If this vulnerability is exploited, the content of direct messages (DMs) between users may be manipulated by a man-in-the-middle attack.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **reliance on obfuscation or encryption without integrity checking**
- **impact:** integrity and manipulate content of direct messages
- **vector:** man-in-the-middle attack
- **product:** FreeFrom - nostr client App
- **version:** prior to 1.3.5

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36279:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the application's reliance on obfuscation or encryption of security-relevant inputs without proper integrity checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CWE-649:** Reliance on obfuscation or encryption of security-relevant inputs without integrity checking. This means that the application encrypts data, such as direct messages (DMs), but does not verify the integrity of the encrypted data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacker can manipulate the content of direct messages between users.
*   The application will not detect that the DM content has been altered.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack:** An attacker positioned between the sender and receiver can intercept encrypted messages and modify them without the application being able to detect the tampering.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the app and the server to perform a MitM attack. This typically requires the attacker to be on the same network as the user or have control over network routing.
*   No user interaction is required beyond the user using the app and sending DMs.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions prior to 1.3.5 of the "FreeFrom - the nostr client" app for both Android and iOS.
*   The fix is to update the application to the latest version.
*   This vulnerability is related to CVE-2024-36289 which also allows for manipulation of DMs via MitM.
*   The application utilizes the Nostr protocol for decentralized social networking.

**Summary:**
The application encrypts direct messages but lacks integrity checks on the encrypted data. This allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to modify message content without detection by the application.
