  "description": "fugit contains time tools for flor and the floraison group. The fugit natural parser, that turns every wednesday at 5pm into 0 17 * * 3, accepted any length of input and went on attempting to parse it, not returning promptly, as expected. The parse call could hold the thread with no end in sight. Fugit dependents that do not check (user) input length for plausibility are impacted. A fix was released in fugit 1.11.1.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-43380:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the `Fugit.parse` and related functions in the `fugit` gem (Ruby library) having poor time complexity when parsing \"natural\" language cron expressions. The parser would accept arbitrarily long input strings and attempt to parse them, leading to excessive resource consumption and potential thread hangs.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Algorithmic Complexity:** The core weakness is the inefficient parsing algorithm in `Fugit::Nat.parse` and related methods that does not handle lengthy input strings gracefully. This leads to a denial-of-service vulnerability.\n- **Lack of Input Validation:** The parser did not check the length of the input string, which could be supplied by users.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could provide a long, crafted input string to the vulnerable `fugit` functions, causing the application to hang indefinitely or consume excessive resources, effectively leading to a denial of service. This would impact services using the `fugit` gem for scheduling tasks.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Input Injection:** The primary attack vector is through the injection of a long, malicious string to any of the vulnerable methods: `Fugit.parse(s)`, `Fugit.do_parse(s)`, `Fugit.parse_nat(s)`, `Fugit.do_parse_nat(s)`, `Fugit::Nat.parse(s)`, and `Fugit::Nat.do_parse(s)`.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs the ability to control or influence the input strings provided to the vulnerable `fugit` parsing methods. This could be through user-supplied data, configuration files, or other external inputs.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The issue was reported in [issue #104](https://github.com/floraison/fugit/issues/104).\n- The fix was implemented by limiting the length of the input string to 256 characters for the `Fugit::Nat.parse(s)` method.\n- The vulnerability was present in versions prior to 1.11.1 of the `fugit` gem.\n- The vulnerability is considered to have a \"Low\" severity rating.\n- The fix was released in `fugit` version 1.11.1.\n- Workarounds involve ensuring that input strings to the mentioned `fugit` functions are not excessively long and are vetted. A limit of 1000 characters is suggested as a safe value, while 10,000 causes stalling.\n- The patch introduced a hard limit of 256 characters in `Fugit::Nat.parse(s)`.\n- Several downstream projects like `sidekiq-cron`, `good_job`, `solid_queue`, and `jets` have been updated to require `fugit` version 1.11.1 or greater to address this vulnerability.\n\nThis information provides more detail than the CVE description placeholder.",

However, in this case, CWE-407 directly addresses the algorithmic inefficiency that is the root cause.

The `Fugit.parse` function accepts any length of input and attempts to parse it, leading to excessive resource consumption.\n\nEvidence:\n\n*   \"The fugit natural parser, that turns every wednesday at 5pm into 0 17 * * 3, accepted any length of input and went on attempting to parse it, not returning promptly, as expected.\"\n*   \"The parse call could hold the thread with no end in sight.\"\n*   \"The vulnerability stems from the `Fugit.parse` and related functions in the `fugit` gem (Ruby library) having poor time complexity when parsing \"natural\" language cron expressions.\"\n\nCWE-407 (Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity) is the most appropriate because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability. The algorithm's inefficiency allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by providing a long, crafted input string.\n\nCWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is a secondary weakness because the parser did not check the length of the input string. This lack of validation allows an attacker to provide an arbitrarily long input string, which then triggers the inefficient algorithm.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the weaknesses present in the vulnerability. CWE-407 is a Class, but captures the main weakness. CWE-1284 being Base level elaborates on the lack of validation.\n\n**CWEs Considered But Not Used:**\n\n*   CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity): While regular expressions are often associated with parsing, the vulnerability description does not explicitly mention the use of inefficient regular expressions. Therefore, this CWE is not as accurate as CWE-407.\n*   CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value): This CWE is related to allocating memory based on untrusted size values. While the inefficient algorithm may lead to excessive memory allocation, the core issue is the algorithmic complexity itself, not the memory allocation.\n*   CWE-409 (Improper Handling of Highly Compressed Data (Data Amplification)): This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability does not involve highly compressed data.\n*   CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference): This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is not related to null pointer dereferences.\n*   CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) and CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read): These are related to memory access issues, but the core weakness is algorithmic complexity, not memory access.\n* CWE-193 (Off-by-one Error): This is not applicable as there are no off by one errors involved.\n* CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation): This is not applicable because it is not a certificate validation issue.\n* CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): This is not applicable because it is not an authorization issue.\n* CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication): This is not applicable because it is not an authentication issue.",
