## Analysis of CVE-2024-10498 Content

This content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2024-10498. Here's an extraction of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   An unauthorized attacker can modify configuration values outside of the normal range when sending specific Modbus write packets to the device. This can result in invalid data or loss of web interface functionality.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Invalid data
*   Loss of web interface functionality

**Attack vectors:**

*   Sending specific Modbus write packets to the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Unauthorized attacker
*   Network access to the device.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Remediation:** Upgrade to version v0.62.11 or newer of HDPM6000.
*   **Mitigation (if patching is delayed):** Ensure the device is not accessible via the Modbus protocol outside the local network segment by applying appropriate firewall configuration and controls, and that access to the network segment is protected and controlled.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   **CVSS Scores:**
    *   v3.1 Base Score: 6.5 (Medium) - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L
