## Vulnerability Description
The WP Travel Ultimate Travel Booking System, Tour Management Engine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the booking_itinerary parameter of the wptravel_get_booking_data function in all versions up to, and including, 10.0.0 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
**Content from plugins.trac.wordpress.org_6f1c7fa7_20250625_002925.html (stripped)**

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   The code retrieves and uses data from `$\_REQUEST` without proper sanitization in line 37.  Specifically, the `wptravel_sanitize_array` function is used, which might not be sufficient to prevent all types of vulnerabilities depending on its implementation and the context in which the data is used.
    *   The code is using  `$wpdb->prepare()` function, which is the correct way to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. However, improper use of the prepare function can still lead to vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   The `wptravel_get_booking_data()` function is designed to fetch booking statistics. The code takes several parameters (`booking_stat_from`, `booking_stat_to`, `booking_country`, `booking_itinerary`, and `compare_stat_from`, `compare_stat_to`, `compare_country`, `compare_itinerary`) from the `$\_REQUEST` array.  An attacker can potentially manipulate these parameters via a crafted HTTP request.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The code checks if the user has "manage\_options" capability before proceeding (line 43). This suggests that the vulnerability, if exploitable, might be accessible to users with administrator privileges.
*   **Mitigation or fix:**
    *   Ensure all data from `$\_REQUEST` is properly validated and sanitized before use. The current use of `wptravel_sanitize_array()` needs to be carefully reviewed to ensure it effectively prevents all potential security issues.
    *   Review and validate the use of `$wpdb->prepare()` to ensure parameters are correctly passed and that the prepared statements are used to prevent SQL injection.
