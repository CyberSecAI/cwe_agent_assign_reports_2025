# Analysis for CVE-2024-11992

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-36 | Absolute Path Traversal | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 0.8 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-36 (Absolute Path Traversal)**, a **Base** level CWE. **CWE-36** is a child of **CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'))**, indicating a more specific type of path traversal. The vulnerability description clearly states "Absolute path traversal" making **CWE-36** a strong candidate. Both **CWE-22** and **CWE-36** can **CANFOLLOW** **CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path)**, which makes sense since the path is influenced by external input.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **ROOTCAUSE** of **CWE-36 (Absolute Path Traversal)** where the application fails to properly neutralize absolute paths provided by the user. This allows an attacker to **bypass restrictions** and **download any file** on the server with appropriate permissions, and potentially **delete files**. The chain is:

1.  **CWE-36 (Absolute Path Traversal)**: Improper neutralization of absolute paths in user-supplied input.
2.  **Impact**: Bypass of intended restrictions, leading to unauthorized file download and deletion.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis strongly suggests **CWE-36 (Absolute Path Traversal)** as the primary CWE, given the explicit mention of "Absolute path traversal" in the vulnerability description. The description states: "**Absolute path traversal** vulnerability in Quick.CMS, version 6.7, the exploitation of which could allow remote users to bypass the intended restrictions and download any file if it has the appropriate permissions outside of documentroot configured on the server via the aDirFiles%5B0%5D parameter in the admin.php page. This vulnerability allows an attacker to delete files stored on the server due to a **lack of proper verification of user-supplied input**."

The retriever results also consistently list **CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'))** and **CWE-36 (Absolute Path Traversal)** as top candidates. While **CWE-22** is a parent of **CWE-36**, the description is specific about "absolute path traversal", justifying the selection of the child CWE. **CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path)** is also relevant, as the vulnerability involves external control of file paths. However, it's a prerequisite for the path traversal, not the **ROOTCAUSE** itself.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with **CWE-36** being a **Base** level CWE that directly reflects the stated vulnerability type.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it
