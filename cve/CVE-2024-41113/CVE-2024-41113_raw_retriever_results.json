Prior to commit c4f81d9616d40c60584e36abb15300853a66e489, the `vis_params` variable on line 383 or line 390 in `pages/1__Timelapse.py` takes user input, which is later used in the `eval()` function on line 395, leading to remote code execution. Commit c4f81d9616d40c60584e36abb15300853a66e489 fixes this issue.",
