# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-10649

# Vulnerability Description

    wandb/openui latest commit c945bb859979659add5f490a874140ad17c56a5d contains a vulnerability where **unauthenticated endpoints** allow **file uploads and downloads from an AWS S3 bucket**. This can lead to **multiple security issues** including denial of service, stored XSS, and information disclosure. The affected endpoints are /v1/share/{idstr} for uploading and /v1/share/{idstr} for downloading JSON files. The **lack of authentication** allows any user to upload and overwrite files, potentially causing the S3 bucket to run out of space, injecting malicious scripts, and accessing sensitive information.
