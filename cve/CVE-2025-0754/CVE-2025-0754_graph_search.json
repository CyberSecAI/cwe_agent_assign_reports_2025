This lack of sanitization can allow attackers to inject malicious payloads into service mesh logs, leading to log injection and spoofing attacks. Such injections can mislead logging mechanisms, enabling attackers to manipulate log entries or execute reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-93 CWE-444 CWE-79 CWE-74 CWE-1385 CWE-138 CWE-918 CWE-941 CWE-532",
