# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-0754

## Vulnerability Description
The vulnerability was found in OpenShift Service Mesh 2.6.3 and 2.5.6. This issue occurs due to **improper sanitization of HTTP headers by Envoy**, particularly the x-forwarded-for header. This lack of sanitization can allow attackers to inject malicious payloads into service mesh logs, leading to log injection and spoofing attacks. Such injections can mislead logging mechanisms, enabling attackers to manipulate log entries or execute reflected **cross-site scripting** (XSS) attacks.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper sanitization of HTTP headers by Envoy**
- **weakness:** **cross-site scripting**
- **impact:** log injection and spoofing attacks
- **product:** OpenShift Service Mesh
- **version:** 2.6.3 and 2.5.6
- **component:** x-forwarded-for header

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-0754 based on provided content:

This content is directly related to CVE-2025-0754. It's a Red Hat Bugzilla report specifically referencing the CVE. Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

Insufficient sanitization of HTTP headers within the OpenShift Service Mesh, specifically the `x-forwarded-for` header.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Log injection attacks via the `x-forwarded-for` header.
*   Lack of proper input validation/sanitization of HTTP headers.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Misleading log entries.
*   Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   Misattribution of request sources.
*   The impact is limited as it primarily affects logging and doesn't lead to remote code execution or privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Crafting HTTP requests with malicious data in the `x-forwarded-for` header.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Ability to send HTTP requests to the OpenShift Service Mesh. No specific privileges are required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

1.  **Filter malicious headers:** Use the `request_headers_to_remove` key to strip potentially malicious headers (including `x-forwarded-for`) from requests.
2.  **Do not trust `x-forwarded-for`:**
    *   Set `xff_num_trusted_hops = 0` (no trusted addresses in XFF).
    *   Set `use_remote_address=true` to use the downstream real IP address instead of relying on the `x-forwarded-for` header (for untrusted environments).

**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**

*   The bug report links to a related CVE (CVE-2025-0752) and suggests the remediation is similar.
*   The report indicates the vulnerability exists in OpenShift Service Mesh versions 2.6.3 and 2.5.6.
*   The report is marked as "NEEDINFO", indicating further investigation or information is required.
