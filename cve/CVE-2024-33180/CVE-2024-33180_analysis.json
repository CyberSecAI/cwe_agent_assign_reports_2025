CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119, which indicates a more specific type of buffer overflow occurring on the stack. The hierarchical relationship helps refine the selection from a general buffer overflow (CWE-119) to a more precise stack-based overflow (CWE-121).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **stack-based buffer overflow** due to the `deviceId` parameter. This leads to potential code execution or denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerability via the deviceId parameter\". This directly aligns with CWE-121, which is a variant-level CWE representing a buffer overflow occurring specifically on the stack.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-121 as a highly relevant candidate, further supporting this selection. The confidence level is high because the description provides clear evidence of a stack-based buffer overflow.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but not selected:\n*   CWE-119: This is a more general class of weakness, and CWE-121 is a more specific variant that fits the vulnerability description better.\n*   CWE-120: This CWE describes a buffer copy without checking the size of the input. While it's related to buffer overflows, the provided description doesn't specify a buffer copy operation, making CWE-121 a more accurate fit.\n*   CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound is not directly related to the provided vulnerability description, which focuses on buffer overflows.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
