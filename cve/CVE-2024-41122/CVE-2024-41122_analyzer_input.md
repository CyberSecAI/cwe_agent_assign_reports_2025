# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-41122

## Vulnerability Description
Woodpecker is a simple yet powerful CI/CD engine with great extensibility. The server allow to create any user who can trigger a pipeline run malicious workflows 1. Those workflows can either lead to a host takeover that runs the agent executing the workflow. 2. Or allow to extract the secrets who would be normally provided to the plugins whos entrypoint are overwritten. This issue has been addressed in release version 2.7.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** host takeover and extract secrets
- **vector:** malicious workflows
- **attacker:** any user who can trigger a pipeline run

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-41122:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the ability to inject arbitrary environment variables into plugin executions within the Woodpecker CI system. Specifically, the lack of sanitization or filtering of environment variables provided to plugins allowed attackers to potentially overwrite environment variables that could alter the execution flow of plugins.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unrestricted Environment Variable Injection:** The core weakness is that Woodpecker CI allowed users to set arbitrary environment variables that were passed directly to plugin executions. This permitted the use of "dangerous" environment variables like `LD_PRELOAD` or `PATH` which influence how binaries and libraries are loaded and executed.
- **Escalated Plugin Context:** The vulnerability is particularly dangerous within the context of escalated plugins, which have higher privileges than standard plugins. This means that an attacker could leverage environment variable injection to execute malicious code with elevated permissions.
- **Bypass of Plugin Entrypoints:** By using these environment variables, an attacker could effectively bypass the intended entrypoint of a plugin and inject their own code to be executed instead.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:

- **Host Takeover:** Attackers could potentially achieve host takeover on the machine running the agent that executes the vulnerable pipeline steps. By using `LD_PRELOAD`, arbitrary shared objects could be loaded and executed with the agent's permissions.
- **Secret Extraction:** Attackers could overwrite environment variables that plugins rely on, intercept secrets, or exfiltrate the provided secrets by running arbitrary commands.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In general, the attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Pipeline Configuration:** An attacker could create a malicious pipeline configuration, either directly or by contributing to a project, that sets specific environment variables designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Malicious User:** A user with access to creating pipeline definitions or triggering pipelines could exploit the vulnerability through crafted workflow definitions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Create/Modify Pipelines:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify pipeline configurations within the Woodpecker CI system. This could be achieved via direct access or by contributing to a project's workflow.
- **Low Privilege:** The required privileges to exploit the issue is considered low. The user does not need administrative access.
- **Network Access:** The attack vector is network based.
- **No User Interaction:** The attack requires no user interaction.

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue was fixed by restricting environment variables to only those starting with `PLUGIN_` and adding a blocklist of dangerous environment variables to prevent interference with plugin execution.
- The vulnerability was present in Woodpecker CI versions prior to 2.7.0.
- A workaround was suggested to enable the gated repo feature and review every change.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Daniel Kilimnik and Felipe Custodio Romero from Neodyme AG.
