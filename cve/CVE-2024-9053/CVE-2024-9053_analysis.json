  "description": "vllm-project vllm version 0.6.0 contains a vulnerability in the AsyncEngineRPCServer() RPC server entrypoints. The core functionality run_server_loop() calls the function _make_handler_coro(), which directly uses cloudpickle.loads() on received messages without any sanitization. This can result in remote code execution by deserializing malicious pickle data.",

CWE-94 [Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')] is a related weakness, and while it is often associated with code execution, it is a more general case. CWE-502 is a more precise description of the vulnerability in this case, since the root cause is specifically due to deserialization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code\"]\n    \n    cwe502 -->|PEEROF| cwe94\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe502 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **deserialization** of untrusted data (CWE-502). The `cloudpickle.loads()` function directly processes received messages without sanitization, leading to remote code execution. Thus, the chain is: CWE-502 -> Code Execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly indicates CWE-502 [Deserialization of Untrusted Data] as the primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions that the `cloudpickle.loads()` function directly uses received messages without any sanitization, which matches the CWE-502 description. The impact is remote code execution.\n\nThe retriever results also support CWE-502 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-94 [Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')] was considered because the vulnerability ultimately leads to code execution. However, since the root cause is the deserialization of untrusted data, CWE-502 is the more specific and appropriate choice.\n\nThe evidence provided in the vulnerability description is clear and directly supports the selection of CWE-502 as the primary weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g. \"eval\").\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed -
