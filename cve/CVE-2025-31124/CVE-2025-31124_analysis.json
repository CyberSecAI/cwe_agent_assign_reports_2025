  "description": "Zitadel is open-source identity infrastructure software. ZITADEL administrators can enable a setting called Ignoring unknown usernames which helps mitigate attacks that try to guess/enumerate usernames. If enabled, ZITADEL will show the password prompt even if the user doesnt exist and report Username or Password invalid. While the setting was correctly respected during the login flow, the users username was normalized leading to a disclosure of the users existence. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.71.6, 2.70.8, 2.69.9, 2.68.9, 2.67.13, 2.66.16, 2.65.7, 2.64.6, and 2.63.9.",

  "reference_content": "CVE-2025-31124\n\n**Vulnerability Description:**\n\nThe content details a user enumeration vulnerability in zitadel. The vulnerability stems from the removal of username normalization during the login process. Previously, a setting \"Ignoring unknown usernames\" was intended to prevent username enumeration, but the normalization process bypassed this protection, revealing whether a username existed.\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe root cause is the removal of username normalization during the login flow, which allowed an attacker to determine if a username exists within the system.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   User Enumeration: An attacker can enumerate valid usernames.\n\n**Impact:**\n\nDisclosure of user existence.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\nAn attacker can attempt to log in with various usernames to determine which ones are valid.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\nNo special privileges or access are required. The attack can be performed remotely.\n\n**Mitigation/Fix:**\n\nUpdate to a patched version:\n\n*   2.71.6 or later\n*   2.70.8 or later\n*   2.69.9 or later\n*   2.68.9 or later\n*   2.67.13 or later\n*   2.66.16 or later\n*   2.65.7 or later\n*   2.64.6 or later\n*   2.63.9 or later\n\nThe fix involves removing the normalization of usernames during the login process.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-31124\n*   **CVSS Score:** Moderate\n*   The vulnerability was reported by Ivan Jedek.\n*   The vulnerability affects versions prior to 2.71.6, 2.70.8, 2.69.9, 2.68.9, 2.67.13, 2.66.16, 2.65.7, 2.64.6, and 2.63.9.",

CWE-203 captures the general issue of the system behaving differently based on valid/invalid usernames. CWE-204 is a more specific case where the difference is in the response. CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) is a higher-level class that is indirectly related. The choice of CWE-203 as primary is based on its ability to capture the root cause, while CWE-204 is a more specific manifestation of this cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe203[\"CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe204[\"CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe204 -->|CHILDOF| cwe203\n    cwe1390 -->|RELATED_TO| cwe203\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe203 primary\n    class cwe204 secondary\n    class cwe1390 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **username normalization** (the **weakness**) which leads to an **observable discrepancy** (CWE-203). The observable discrepancy allows for **user enumeration**, which is the impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis focuses on the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **username normalization** during the login flow. This leads to an observable discrepancy where the system behaves differently based on whether a username exists. The evidence for this is clear in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states that \"The root cause is the removal of username normalization during the login flow, which allowed an attacker to determine if a username exists within the system.\"\n\nCWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy) is the most appropriate primary CWE because it captures the general issue of the system behaving differently, exposing security-relevant information. CWE-204 (Observable Response Discrepancy) is a more specific manifestation of this issue, where the response differs based on username validity. CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) is considered but is a higher-level class that is indirectly related, as the user enumeration weakens the authentication mechanism.\n\nThe selection of CWE-203 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it captures the root cause of the vulnerability without being overly specific to the response mechanism.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25
