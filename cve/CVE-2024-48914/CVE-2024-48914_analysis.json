  "description": "Vendure is an open-source headless commerce platform. Prior to versions 3.0.5 and 2.3.3, a vulnerability in Vendures asset server plugin allows an attacker to craft a request which is able to traverse the server file system and retrieve the contents of arbitrary files, including sensitive data such as configuration files, environment variables, and other critical data stored on the server. In the same code path is an additional vector for crashing the server via a malformed URI. Patches are available in versions 3.0.5 and 2.3.3. Some workarounds are also available. One may use object storage rather than the local file system, e.g. MinIO or S3, or define middleware which detects and blocks requests with urls containing `/../`.",

This allows path traversal attacks.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n1.  **Path Traversal:** The application does not properly sanitize user-provided paths, allowing an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.\n2. **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Malformed URI characters in the asset URL can crash the server due to an error in `decodeURIComponent`.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n1.  **Path Traversal:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive data like configuration files and credentials.\n2.  **DoS:** Malformed requests can crash the server, making the service unavailable to users.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n1. **Path Traversal:** Sending a crafted HTTP request with a URL containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the asset path. For example: `http://localhost:3000/assets/../package.json`\n2. **DoS:** Sending a crafted HTTP request with a malformed URI (e.g., `%80`) in the asset path. For example: `http://localhost:3000/assets/%80package.json`\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nThe attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server. No prior authentication or special privileges are required. The attacker can be on the network (remote).",

The vulnerability stems from the usage of `decodeURIComponent(req.path)` directly in `path.join` without any path normalization. This allows path traversal attacks |\n| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. Malformed URI characters in the asset URL can crash the server due to an error in `decodeURIComponent`. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-23, which describes the path traversal vulnerability. CWE-400 is the denial of service due to malformed requests.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe23[\"CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe834[\"CWE-834: Excessive Iteration\"]\n    \n    cwe23 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe400 -->|CHILDOF| cwe834\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe23 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper neutralization of path delimiters** in user-controlled input (CWE-23).\n2.  **Impact:** Arbitrary file read.\n3.  **Root Cause:** **Improper handling of malformed URI characters** leading to a crash (CWE-400).\n4.  **Impact:** Denial of Service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is **Relative Path Traversal (CWE-23)**. The vulnerability description clearly states that an attacker can craft a request to traverse the server file system and retrieve arbitrary files. The root cause is the **lack of proper sanitization of user-provided paths**, specifically the use of `decodeURIComponent(req.path)` in `path.join` without normalization, as mentioned in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\n\nAdditionally, there's a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability due to malformed URI characters. This is classified as **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)**, as the malformed input leads to excessive resource consumption, crashing the server.\n\nThe retriever results list CWE-22 and CWE-23 which are related. CWE-23 is more specific and thus more appropriate.\n\nCWE-918, CWE-212, CWE-201, CWE-863, CWE-639, CWE-306, CWE-502 and CWE-226 were considered but are not as closely aligned with the specific vulnerabilities described. They are either related to different attack vectors (SSRF, Deserialization) or different types of weaknesses (information leakage, authorization issues).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced
