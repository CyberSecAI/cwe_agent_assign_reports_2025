- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** sqlitedict
- **version:** up to v2.1.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-35515:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure deserialization of data using the `pickle.loads` function within the `sqlitedict` library. The library stores values in a SQLite database after serializing them with pickle, and deserializes them upon retrieval using `pickle.loads` without proper sanitization. This allows for the execution of arbitrary code by crafting malicious pickle payloads.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The core issue is the use of `pickle.loads` to deserialize data retrieved from the SQLite database. `pickle` is known to be vulnerable to code execution attacks if used to deserialize data from untrusted sources.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The `sqlitedict` library does not sanitize or validate the data retrieved from the database before deserializing it with `pickle.loads`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By inserting a specially crafted pickle payload into the database, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the system when the data is later retrieved and deserialized using `sqlitedict`.
*   **Local Code Execution:** The provided exploit demonstrates local code execution, which can potentially be escalated to gain further access.
*   **Data Manipulation:** It may allow for data manipulation within the sqlite database.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Database Poisoning:** An attacker could create or modify a SQLite database file containing malicious pickle payloads within the stored data.
*   **Data Injection:** If an attacker can inject data into a database that is subsequently accessed by a vulnerable `sqlitedict` instance, they can trigger the deserialization of malicious data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to Modify or Create a SQLite database:** The attacker must be able to either create a new SQLite database or modify an existing one that will later be accessed by the vulnerable application.
*   **Access to Execute Python Code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute Python code to create the malicious payload, and be able to have the vulnerable `sqlitedict` library process the malicious data.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes Proof-of-Concept (PoC) code showing how to generate a malicious SQLite database and how to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability exists in `sqlitedict` versions <= 2.1.0.
*   The maintainers of `sqlitedict` were informed about the vulnerability.

This is more detailed than the basic CVE description, and provides a good understanding of the vulnerability and how it can be exploited.
