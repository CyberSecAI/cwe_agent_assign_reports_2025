CWE-770 and CWE-410 are both children of higher-level classes and represent more specific resource management issues. The vulnerability description directly mentions **uncontrolled resource consumption**, making CWE-400 a good initial fit. CWE-770 and CWE-410 provide more granular details about the specific type of resource issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe410[\"CWE-410: Insufficient Resource Pool\"]\n    cwe664[\"CWE-664: Improper Control of Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664\n    cwe410 -->|CHILDOF| cwe664\n    cwe664 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe410 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the lack of control over resource consumption (CWE-400). An attacker exploits this by sending large batches of queries, leading to the exhaustion of resources and denial of service. The lack of limits on resource allocation (CWE-770) and the insufficient resource pool (CWE-410) contribute to the vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-400 as the primary weakness due to the direct mention of **uncontrolled resource consumption**. The retriever results and graph relationships support this choice, with CWE-400 being the most relevant class-level CWE. CWE-770 and CWE-410 were considered as more specific weaknesses that contribute to the overall uncontrolled resource consumption. CWE-770 captures the **root cause** of allocating resources without limits, and CWE-410 highlights that the resource pool is not large enough to handle the attack. The selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-400 as the general class and CWE-770 and CWE-410 providing more detailed information about the specific resource management issues.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states, \"This vulnerability is due to **uncontrolled resource consumption**.\" This statement provides direct evidence supporting the selection of CWE-400 as the primary weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.63\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the \"technical impact\" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs.
