# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-7177

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in TOTOLINK A3600R 4.1.2cu.5182_B20201102. It has been classified as critical. Affected is the function setLanguageCfg of the file /cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi. The manipulation of the argument langType leads to **buffer overflow**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. VDB-272598 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability. NOTE The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **buffer overflow**
- **product:** TOTOLINK A3600R
- **version:** 4.1.2cu.5182_B20201102
- **component:** setLanguageCfg in /cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the `setLanguageCfg` function within the TOTOLINK A3600R router firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The `langType` parameter, received through a POST request, is used in the `CsteSystem` function without proper bounds checking. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system.
- **Command Injection:** Due to the lack of input sanitization, the attacker can inject malicious commands directly into the `langType` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system.
- **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete control of the vulnerable device.
- **Data Exposure/Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially access, modify, or delete data stored on the device.
- **Denial of Service:** The attacker could cause the device to malfunction or become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted POST request to the `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint with the `topicurl` set to `setLanguageCfg` and the `langType` parameter containing malicious commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router. This could be from within the same network or, if the router's administration interface is exposed, from the internet.
- **Understanding of the API:** The attacker needs to know the correct endpoint (`/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi`), the correct topic URL (`setLanguageCfg`), and the vulnerable parameter (`langType`).
- **No Authentication Bypass Necessary:** While the provided POC uses a cookie, the vulnerability is present in how the `langType` parameter is processed, meaning that even with valid credentials a malicious command can be sent through this parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided POC demonstrates how an attacker could use `ls -al ../` to list the contents of the parent directory. However, any shell command can be executed.
- The vulnerability affects the TOTOLINK A3600R router, specifically firmware version `V4.1.2cu.5182_B20201102`.
