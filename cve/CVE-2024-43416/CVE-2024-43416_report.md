# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-43416

## Description

GLPI is a free asset and IT management software package. Starting in version 0.80 and prior to version 10.0.17, an unauthenticated user can use an application endpoint to check if an email address corresponds to a valid GLPI user. Version 10.0.17 fixes the issue.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Impact:** check if email corresponds to valid GLPI user
- **Vector:** unauthenticated
- **Attacker:** user
- **Product:** GLPI
- **Version:** 0.80 to 10.0.17
- **Component:** application endpoint

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability exposes valid email addresses, which is sensitive information. |
| CWE-209 | Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. While the vulnerability doesn't explicitly generate an *error* message, the application's response reveals information (valid email) that it shouldn't. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-201, which focuses on the insertion of sensitive information into sent data. CWE-209 is a peer that involves the generation of error messages containing sensitive data. While the described vulnerability doesn't produce error messages, it does expose sensitive user information, so CWE-209 is a possible secondary CWE.

## Vulnerability Chain
The chain starts with the application endpoint that fails to properly obscure whether an email address is associated with a valid user account. This leads to the exposure of sensitive information (valid email addresses).

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided evidence from the vulnerability description and the CVE reference. The core issue is that the application reveals whether an email address is associated with a valid user, which falls under the definition of CWE-201, Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data.

The selection of CWE-201 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The application endpoint, due to **missing** controls or **improper** design, allows an unauthenticated user to determine whether an email address is present in the system.

CWE-209, Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information, was considered because the application is effectively "leaking" information about the system's users, but it doesn't explicitly involve an error message. The key phrase is "check if email corresponds to valid GLPI user" which is the sensitive information.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74

## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).
