  "description": "A log spoofing flaw was found in the Tuned package due to improper sanitization of some API arguments. This flaw allows an attacker to pass a controlled sequence of characters newlines can be inserted into the log. Instead of the evil the attacker could mimic a valid TuneD log line and trick the administrator. The quotes are usually used in TuneD logs citing raw user input, so there will always be the character ending the spoofed input, and the administrator can easily overlook this. This logged string is later used in logging and in the output of utilities, for example, `tuned-adm get_instances` or other third-party programs that use Tuneds D-Bus interface for such operations.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-52337:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe `instance_name` parameter within the `instance_create()` D-Bus method of the `tuned` daemon is not properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary data into the instance name string.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the absence of input validation and sanitization for the `instance_name` parameter before it's used in logging and other outputs.\n- **Log Spoofing:** By injecting newline characters into the `instance_name`, an attacker can create seemingly independent and legitimate-looking log entries, effectively spoofing the logs.\n- **Terminal Manipulation:** Injection of terminal control sequences within the `instance_name` can influence the terminal emulators of administrators or other users who view the output.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Log Spoofing:**  Attackers can insert misleading or fabricated log entries, potentially hiding malicious activities or creating confusion.\n- **Terminal Hijacking:** By injecting terminal control sequences, an attacker can potentially manipulate the terminal emulators, leading to unexpected behavior, visual deception, or denial-of-service on affected terminals. The provided PoC shows that an attacker can cause a terminal to switch to the alternate screen, thus breaking the administrator's view.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **D-Bus Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `instance_create()` D-Bus method of the `tuned` daemon.\n- **Local Access:**  The attacker needs to be a locally logged-in user on the system to exploit the vulnerability. Polkit allows `instance_create` method calls without authentication for locally logged-in users.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Local User:** The attacker must have a user account on the target system.\n- **D-Bus Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to send D-Bus messages to the `tuned` daemon.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- This vulnerability affects `tuned` versions >= 2.23.0.\n- The `instance_create()` D-Bus method was introduced in commit [cddcd233](https://github.com/redhat-performance/tuned/commit/cddcd2336944a56e313324c699dd739fe8f1f85d).\n- Patches are available in `tuned` version 2.24.1 which include input sanitization using the `is_valid_name()` function.\n- Red Hat has issued security advisories (RHSA-2024:10381, RHSA-2024:10384, RHSA-2024:11161, RHSA-2025:0195) to address this vulnerability in various versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.",

This vulnerability stems from the `tuned` package's failure to properly sanitize API arguments before writing them to logs. **CWE-93 CRLF Injection** is a contributing factor because the **improper sanitization** allows for the injection of newline characters.

This leads to **CWE-93 Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')**, allowing an attacker to inject newline characters.

The key phrase \"**improper sanitization of API arguments**\" points to a neutralization issue, and the summary confirms the **lack of input sanitization**.\n\nThe graph relationships helped to clarify the sequence of events. **CWE-117** is the primary weakness as it's the initial flaw. **CWE-93** contributes by allowing the injection, and **CWE-532** is the final impact.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. **CWE-117** is a Base CWE that directly addresses the **improper output neutralization** in logs. **CWE-93** is a Base CWE that highlights the specific type of injection. **CWE-532** is a Base CWE that accurately describes the insertion of sensitive information into the log file.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   **CWE-117 Improper Output Neutralization for Logs**: The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes output that is written to logs. This aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description, where the `tuned` package fails to sanitize API arguments before logging them.\n*   **CWE-93 Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')**: The product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs. The vulnerability allows injecting newline characters, which directly corresponds to this CWE.\n*   **CWE-532 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File**: The product writes sensitive information to a log file. The log spoofing results in the insertion of attacker-controlled data into the logs, making this CWE relevant.\n\nCWEs Considered but Not Used:\n\n*   CWE-74, CWE-78, CWE-88, CWE-94, CWE-138, CWE-116: These are related to injection and improper neutralization, but they are either too general or focused on specific injection types (e.g., OS command injection, code injection) that don't precisely match the vulnerability. While there is injection of CRLF sequences (**CWE-93**), the **root cause** is the **improper output neutralization** for logs (**CWE-117**).\n*   CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'): This is specific to web applications, so it is not relevant to this vulnerability.\n*   CWE-532: While the end result is insertion into the log file, that is an impact of the root cause, so that is secondary.",
