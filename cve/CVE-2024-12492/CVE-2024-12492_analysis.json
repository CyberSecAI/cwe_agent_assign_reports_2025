The **weakness** is explicitly identified as **sql injection**. The most relevant CWE is therefore CWE-89, which directly addresses **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')**.\n\nThe retriever results also strongly support this, with CWE-89 having the highest score of 1.0.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
