The vulnerability description clearly states that the manipulation leads to **os command injection**. |\n| CWE-77 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary candidate. CWE-77 is a parent of CWE-78.

CWE-74 is a more general injection issue.

Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"os command injection\", CWE-78 is the more appropriate choice. CWE-74 is too high-level and does not provide enough specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: OS Command Injection\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Command Injection\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Injection\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe77 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n    class cwe74 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of special elements within the input, leading to **OS command injection**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates an **OS command injection** vulnerability. The Retriever Results strongly support CWE-78 as the primary CWE. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-78 is the most specific and appropriate choice compared to its parents. The decision is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and supported by the retriever results.
