CWE-200 is a broader Class level CWE that describes the exposure of sensitive information. CWE-359 is more specific than CWE-200. CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) could be a contributing factor, as a lack of authorization checks might lead to the information exposure. However, the description focuses on the exposure itself due to error messages.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe359 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe862 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe359\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe359 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Information Exposure** through error messages, which allows unauthenticated attackers to exfiltrate data from the wp_usermeta table.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **information exposure**, specifically the exposure of private personal information due to error messages. The description explicitly states \"This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to exfiltrate data from wp_usermeta table\". This aligns well with CWE-359.\n\nCWE-359 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred. The vulnerability description highlights the exposure of private personal information, making CWE-359 a good fit.\n\nCWE-200 was considered but not chosen as the primary CWE because CWE-359 is a more specific child that better matches the vulnerability description.\n\nCWE-862 was considered because the **missing authorization** could be a contributing factor to information exposure, but the vulnerability description doesn't explicitly mention that authorization checks are missing. The root cause of the vulnerability is the information exposure through error messages.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially
