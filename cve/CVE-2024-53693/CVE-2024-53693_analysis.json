CWE-113, a variant of CWE-93, specifies this weakness in the context of HTTP headers. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences** and **CRLF Injection**, making CWE-93 the most appropriate root cause. CWE-113 is considered as a secondary candidate since the specific context of the vulnerability (HTTP headers) isn't definitively confirmed, although it is highly likely given the nature of web applications.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\"]\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    \n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe93\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe93 primary\n    class cwe113 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences** (CWE-93), which leads to the ability for remote attackers with user access to modify application data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences** which directly maps to CWE-93. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section further confirms this as the **root cause of the vulnerability**, stating: \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** **Improper neutralization of CRLF sequences** ('CRLF Injection').\" and \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CRLF Injection vulnerability.\" The impact is the modification of application data. Given the high similarity scores and the explicit mention in the vulnerability description, CWE-93 is the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nCWE-113, while a more specific variant, is considered as a secondary candidate. It's a strong possibility, but without explicit confirmation of the vulnerability affecting HTTP headers, it's safer to keep it as a secondary consideration.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced
