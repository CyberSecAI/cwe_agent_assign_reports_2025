  "description": "A vulnerability in Crater Invoice allows an unauthenticated attacker with knowledge of the APP_KEY to achieve remote command execution on the server by manipulating the laravel_session cookie, exploiting **arbitrary deserialization** through the encrypted session data. The exploitation vector of this vulnerability relies on an attacker obtaining Laravels secret APP_KEY, which would allow them to decrypt and manipulate session cookies (laravel_session) containing serialized data. By altering this data and re-encrypting it with the APP_KEY, the attacker could trigger **arbitrary deserialization** on the server, potentially leading to remote command execution (RCE). The vulnerability is primarily exploited by accessing an exposed cookie and manipulating it using the secret key to gain malicious access to the server.",

  "reference_content": "```\nRoot cause of vulnerability:\nThe vulnerability is caused by the use of the `SESSION_DRIVER=cookie` option in the default Crater `.env` file. This stores sessions as a ciphered value inside a cookie. These sessions are made from a specially crafted JSON containing serialized data which is then ciphered using Laravel's `encrypt()` function. An attacker in possession of the `APP_KEY` can decrypt the cookie and modify the serialized data to achieve arbitrary deserialization, leading to remote command execution.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n- Unauthenticated Remote Command Execution\n- Arbitrary deserialization\n- Laravel session cookie vulnerability\n\nImpact of exploitation:\nRemote command execution on the server.\n\nAttack vectors:\nThe attack vector is to obtain the `APP_KEY`, retrieve the `laravel_session` and `DqNfdAQoevsVc3L2TmqIttblIQGIJPVdLrwoY7xT` cookies, decrypt them, modify the serialized data to include a malicious payload, re-encrypt the cookies and send the manipulated cookies to the server.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\nAn attacker needs to be in possession of the `APP_KEY`.\n\nMitigation or fix:\n- Regenerate a new `APP_KEY`.\n- Migrate to InvoiceShelf, a Crater invoice fork that is still maintained.\n```",
