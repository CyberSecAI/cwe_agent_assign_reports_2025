Since no further information is available in the description, it is difficult to determine a more specific Base or Variant CWE. Several related CWEs, such as CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization], and CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function] were considered, but the description specifically mentions \"**improper authorization**,\" making CWE-862 the most relevant choice. The parent-child relationships indicate that more specific authorization-related CWEs exist, but the current description lacks the detail needed to select them.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|PEEROF| cwe285\n    cwe862 -->|PEEROF| cwe863\n    cwe862 -->|PEEROF| cwe306\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe863,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check, which leads to unauthorized access.\n\nMissing Authorization (CWE-862) -> Unauthorized Access\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates \"**improper authorization**\" due to manipulation of `/index.php/display/database/` in Altenergy Power Control Software. The provided evidence is weak as the description is high level with little technical detail.\n\nThe description explicitly points to an authorization issue. Given the absence of authentication-related keywords, CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function] is not suitable. The choice is between CWE-862 [Missing Authorization], CWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization], and CWE-285 [Improper Authorization]. CWE-862 is selected because the description says \"**improper authorization**\".\n\nThe optimal level of specificity is limited by the available information.\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
