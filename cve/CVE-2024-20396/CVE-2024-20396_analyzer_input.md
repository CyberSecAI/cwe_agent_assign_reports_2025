# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-20396

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the protocol handlers of Cisco Webex App could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information. This vulnerability exists because the affected application **does not safely handle file protocol handlers**. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a link that is designed to cause the application to send requests. If the attacker can observe transmitted traffic in a privileged network position, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to capture sensitive information, including credential information, from the requests.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **does not safely handle file protocol handlers**
- **impact:** capture sensitive information and gain access to sensitive information and including credential information
- **vector:** persuading a user to follow a link
- **attacker:** unauthenticated remote attacker
- **product:** Cisco Webex App
- **component:** protocol handlers

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because the affected application does not safely handle file protocol handlers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unsafe handling of file protocol handlers, leading to potential information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could capture sensitive information, including credential information, from the requests.
