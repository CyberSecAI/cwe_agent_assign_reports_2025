  "description": "A vulnerability in the protocol handlers of Cisco Webex App could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information. This vulnerability exists because the affected application **does not safely handle file protocol handlers**. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a link that is designed to cause the application to send requests. If the attacker can observe transmitted traffic in a privileged network position, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to capture sensitive information, including credential information, from the requests.",

While several other CWEs were considered, they were either too general (e.g., CWE-20, CWE-287) or not directly applicable to the core issue of sensitive data being transmitted without encryption. CWE-306 was considered as a secondary weakness because the vulnerability could be related to a missing authentication mechanism that allows sensitive information to be transmitted without proper authorization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe672[\"CWE-672: Operation on a Resource Without Holding a Required Lock\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe306\n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe319\n    cwe613[\"CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\"]\n    cwe613 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe613 -->|CHILDOF| cwe672\n    cwe306 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe613\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n    class cwe287,cwe672,cwe613 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **unsafe handling of file protocol handlers** in the Webex App. This leads to the application sending requests that, when observed by an attacker, reveal sensitive information in cleartext (CWE-319). A possible contributing factor could be **missing authentication for critical functions** (CWE-306) that would otherwise protect the sensitive data being transmitted.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary focus of this vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive information due to cleartext transmission. The vulnerability description explicitly states that an attacker can capture sensitive information, including credential information, from the requests. The root cause is the application **does not safely handle file protocol handlers**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-319 is strongly supported by the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which both highlight the cleartext transmission of sensitive data. The retriever results also list CWE-319 as the top combined result, reinforcing this choice.\n\nCWE-306 was considered as a potential secondary weakness, as the lack of proper authentication could contribute to the vulnerability. If authentication were in place, the sensitive information might not be transmitted in the first place. However, the primary issue is the cleartext transmission itself, making CWE-319 the more appropriate primary classification.\n\nCWE-20, CWE-287, and other high-level CWEs were considered but ultimately rejected because they do not accurately reflect the specific nature of the vulnerability, which is the transmission of sensitive information in cleartext.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
