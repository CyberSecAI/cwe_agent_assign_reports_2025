Specifically, a user with lower privileges could gain the ability to perform actions or access resources that should be restricted to users with higher privileges.\n\n**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). The attack is of low complexity (AC:L) and requires a low privileged user (PR:L) with no user interaction (UI:N). The scope is unchanged (S:U), indicating the vulnerability is confined to the component itself.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have low privileged access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.",

CWE-285 Improper Authorization is a parent of CWE-863, while CWE-284 Improper Access Control is a more general term. The selection of CWE-863 is based on the vulnerability description specifying an **Improper Authorization vulnerability** leading to a security feature bypass, implying that authorization checks are in place but are not correctly implemented. This indicates a more specific case of authorization failure compared to a general access control issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Improper Authorization vulnerability** (CWE-863), leading to a Security feature bypass. A low-privileged attacker can then leverage this to disclose minor information. The root cause is the flawed authorization logic, and the impact is the security feature bypass and information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly suggested CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization due to the explicit mention of **Improper Authorization vulnerability**. The provided evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section further confirms this, stating that the **Root cause of vulnerability:** **Improper Access Control (CWE-284)** and that \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from an improper access control, allowing a user to potentially perform actions they should not be authorized to execute.\" However, since the vulnerability description is more specific about **Improper Authorization**, selecting CWE-863 is more appropriate than CWE-284 which is a more general term. Furthermore, the guidance on authentication vs authorization supports this decision.

CWE-285 Improper Authorization is a parent of CWE-863, while CWE-284 Improper Access Control is a more general term. The selection of CWE-863 is based on the vulnerability description specifying an **Improper Authorization vulnerability** leading to a security feature bypass, implying that authorization checks are in place but are not correctly implemented. This indicates a more specific case of authorization failure compared to a general access control issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Improper Authorization vulnerability** (CWE-863), leading to a Security feature bypass. A low-privileged attacker can then leverage this to disclose minor information. The root cause is the flawed authorization logic, and the impact is the security feature bypass and information disclosure.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly suggested CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization due to the explicit mention of **Improper Authorization vulnerability**. The provided evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section further confirms this, stating that the **Root cause of vulnerability:** **Improper Access Control (CWE-284)** and that \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from an improper access control, allowing a user to potentially perform actions they should not be authorized to execute.\" However, since the vulnerability description is more specific about **Improper Authorization**, selecting CWE-863 is more appropriate than CWE-284 which is a more general term.
