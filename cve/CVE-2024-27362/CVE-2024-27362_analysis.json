  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-27362\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The mobile processor does not properly check the length of the data being processed.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- Improper data length validation. This allows for out-of-bounds reads, which can expose sensitive information.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Information disclosure. An attacker could potentially read memory contents beyond the intended boundaries, revealing sensitive data.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The vulnerability is in the mobile processor, likely within firmware or a driver related to data processing.\n- The exact method of triggering this vulnerability is not specified in this description, but it likely involves sending specially crafted input data to the affected processor.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- An attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted data input to the affected mobile processor. This could potentially be achieved through a malicious app or by exploiting other vulnerabilities that lead to code execution on the device.\n- The attacker does not need to be physically present and can trigger this vulnerability remotely if the device is vulnerable to receiving malicious data.\n\n**Affected Products and Versions:**\n- Exynos 1280\n- Exynos 2200\n- Exynos 1330\n- Exynos 1380\n- Exynos 2400\n\n**Severity:**\n- Medium\n\n**Reported Date:**\n- 2024-01-15\n\n**Acknowledgement:**\n- Chao Ma of Baidu AIoT Security Team.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The content provides more specific details than the CVE description placeholder, such as affected product names and the reporting date.\n- The content is from an official Samsung website which suggests that this information can be considered reliable.",

The **CWE-125** then leads to **CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**. **CWE-1284** is a child of **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**.
