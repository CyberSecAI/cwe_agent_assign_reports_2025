CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119, representing a more specific type of buffer overflow. Given the explicit mention of a \"heap-based buffer overflow\" in the vulnerability description, CWE-122 was chosen for its higher specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single, direct weakness:\n\n1.  **Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-122)**: The `H5Z__scaleoffset_decompress_one_byte` function in HDF5 1.14.6 contains a **heap-based buffer overflow** vulnerability.\n\nThis chain highlights the direct cause-and-effect relationship, where the **buffer overflow** directly leads to potential exploitation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability based on the provided description. The key phrase \"heap-based buffer overflow\" immediately pointed towards CWE-122. The retriever results also listed CWE-122 and CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) as highly relevant.\n\nThe final decision to assign CWE-122 as the primary CWE was based on the principle of selecting the most specific CWE that accurately represents the weakness. While CWE-119 is a broader category, CWE-122 provides a more precise classification of the vulnerability as a **heap-based buffer overflow**. The evidence provided in the vulnerability description directly supports this classification.\n\nCWE-119 was considered as a secondary CWE due to its parent relationship with CWE-122, but given the explicit **heap-based buffer overflow**, CWE-122 was chosen as the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant
