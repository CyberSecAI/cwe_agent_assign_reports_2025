  "description": "In the goTenna Pro App, the encryption keys are stored along with a static IV on the End User Device (EUD). This allows for complete decryption of keys stored on the EUD if physically compromised. This allows an attacker to decrypt all encrypted broadcast communications based on encryption keys stored on the EUD. This requires access to and control of the EUD, so it is recommended to use strong access control measures and layered encryption on the EUD for more secure operation.",

CWE-1204 (Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)) is a Base CWE and represents a related but distinct weakness, as the vulnerability involves both the storage of encryption keys and the use of a static IV. These weaknesses can exist independently but are related in this vulnerability. There are no direct relationships between CWE-321 and CWE-1204 in the graph.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe1204[\"CWE-1204: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe321 primary\n    class cwe1204,cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insecure storage of encryption keys along with a static IV (CWE-321, CWE-1204)** on the End User Device (EUD). This leads to the potential **complete decryption of keys stored on the EUD if physically compromised**, enabling an attacker to **decrypt all encrypted broadcast communications**. The vulnerability chain is:\n1.  **CWE-321**: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key - Root Cause: **Encryption keys stored**\n2.  **CWE-1204**: Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV) - Root Cause: **Static IV**\n3.  Impact: Complete decryption of keys stored on EUD and encrypted communications\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis identifies the primary weakness as CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) because the **encryption keys are stored** on the End User Device (EUD) and a secondary weakness of CWE-1204 (Generation of Weak Initialization Vector (IV)) because a **static IV** is used.\n\nThe selection of CWE-321 as the primary CWE is supported by the vulnerability description, which states that encryption keys are stored along with a static IV. This aligns with the description of CWE-321, which refers to the use of hard-coded cryptographic keys. The use of a static IV is represented by the secondary weakness CWE-1204.\n\nThe retriever results also listed CWE-321 as the top candidate.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root causes of the vulnerability. CWE-321 is a Variant, and CWE-1204 is a Base, which are the preferred abstraction levels.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
