  "description": "The Add Admin CSS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.1. This is due to the plugin utilizing bootstrap and leaving test files with **display_errors** on. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6547:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the \"Add Admin CSS\" WordPress plugin including test files that have `display_errors` enabled. This causes the plugin to inadvertently expose the full server path when those test files are accessed.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Full Path Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the full server path due to misconfigured error handling in test files.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can discover the absolute path of the web application on the server.\n- **Aid to Further Attacks:** While the path itself isn't directly harmful, it provides valuable information to an attacker. This information can be leveraged to help them craft more targeted and effective attacks if they find other vulnerabilities. The disclosure is not useful on its own.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests to the affected test file.\n- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable website.\n- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any specific privileges or to log in to the website.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- The vulnerability exists in all versions of the Add Admin CSS plugin up to and including 2.0.1.\n- The fix is not available at the time of this posting. The suggested mitigation is to uninstall the plugin and find an alternative.\n- The vulnerability was discovered by stealthcopter and publicly disclosed on July 26, 2024.",
