## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to **insufficient validation of received IPv4 PIMv2 packets**. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PIMv2 packet to a PIM-enabled interface on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note This vulnerability can be exploited with either an IPv4 multicast or unicast packet.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient validation of received IPv4 PIMv2 packets**
- **impact:** denial of service (DoS)
- **vector:** crafted PIMv2 packet
- **attacker:** unauthenticated remote attacker
- **product:** Cisco IOS XE Software
- **component:** Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) feature

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient validation of received IPv4 PIMv2 packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation of PIMv2 packets.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted PIMv2 packet to a PIM-enabled interface on an affected device. This can be achieved using either an IPv4 multicast or unicast packet.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to a PIM-enabled interface on the vulnerable device.
