## Vulnerability Description
A problem with the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app can result in exposure of encrypted user credentials, used for connecting to GlobalProtect, in application logs. Normally, these application logs are only viewable by local users and are included when generating logs for troubleshooting purposes. This means that these encrypted credentials are exposed to recipients of the application logs.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** exposure of encrypted user credentials
- **product:** Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app improperly handles encrypted user credentials, including username and password, and writes them to application log files (PanGPA.log), where they can be exposed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    -  Insertion of sensitive information (encrypted user credentials) into log files (CWE-532).
    - Exposure of encrypted credentials to recipients of the application logs.
-  **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Exposure of user credentials used to connect to GlobalProtect.
    - Potential compromise of user accounts if the encryption is weak or can be broken.
    -  Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of the system can be impacted
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network: A remote attacker could obtain the log files, which might contain exposed credentials, if the log files are transmitted.
    - Local access to the endpoint where the GlobalProtect application is installed: Local users can view the log files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    -  Access to log files:  Either a local user on the system, or someone who gains access to the logs if they are transmitted.
    - No special privileges are required to view the log files
    - Requires user interaction - logs need to be generated.
