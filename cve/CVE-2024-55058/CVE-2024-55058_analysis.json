It's related to higher-level categories like CWE-285 Improper Authorization and CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization, but provides a more specific description of the root cause.

This allows an attacker to directly request and access sensitive data, bypassing intended access controls (CWE-425). The underlying cause is likely an incorrect or missing authorization mechanism (CWE-863) that fails to properly validate the user's permission to access the requested data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis strongly supports CWE-639 as the primary CWE due to the clear evidence of an **insecure direct object reference** in the vulnerability description and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\". The vulnerability allows authenticated users to access sensitive birth certificate details of other users by manipulating the `viewid` parameter in the URL, indicating a direct bypass of authorization through a user-controlled key.\n\nCWE-425 is a relevant secondary CWE as the vulnerability also involves a direct request to a resource without adequate authorization enforcement. CWE-863 is included as a high-level classification indicating the presence of some authorization mechanism, albeit an **incorrect** one.\n\nThe selection is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions the **insecure direct object reference** and the ability to access other users' data by manipulating the `viewid` parameter. The retriever results also support these findings, with CWE-639 being the top-ranked result.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-639 being a base-level CWE that directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Justification:** The vulnerability description states that authenticated users can access sensitive data of other users by manipulating the `viewid` parameter. This directly aligns with the description of CWE-639, where the authorization mechanism fails to prevent unauthorized access through a user-controlled key. Confidence: 0.95\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Justification:** The vulnerability allows authenticated users to directly request and access data associated with other users by manipulating the `viewid` parameter in the URL. The application does not adequately enforce authorization, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information. Confidence: 0.75\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1362.61\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Justification:** This vulnerability implies that there might be some sort of authorization in place, but it's not correctly implemented, allowing the bypass. While CWE-639 is more specific, CWE-863 captures the high-level aspect of an authorization check existing but failing. Confidence: 0.65\n\n## Other CWEs Considered\n\n*   **CWE-285: Improper Authorization**: While relevant, it's a higher-level class CWE and less specific than CWE-639.\n*   **CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function**: Not applicable, as the vulnerability requires an authenticated user.\n*   **CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path** and **CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')**: These are not relevant as the vulnerability doesn't involve file path manipulation or SQL injection.",
