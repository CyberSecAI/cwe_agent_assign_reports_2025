An authenticated user must be able to interact with the installer on the local machine. The user needs to trigger the installer with a specially crafted input.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access to the targeted Windows machine and must be able to run the Zoom Workplace Desktop application installer. The user also needs to be able to trigger the vulnerability with the required input.",

While ideally a more specific CWE would be chosen, the information provided is too general to pinpoint the exact type of **improper input validation**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe20 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** in the Zoom Workplace Desktop App installer, which leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the denial-of-service vulnerability. The description clearly states that the vulnerability stems from **improper input validation** in the installer.\n\nThe **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** identifies the **rootcause** as \"**Improper input validation**\" which is a perfect match for CWE-20.\n\nThe **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** states:\n- \"**Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the installer of the Zoom Workplace Desktop App for Windows.\"\n- \"**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The installer does not properly validate input, allowing for a denial-of-service attack.\"\n\nThe retriever results also point to CWE-20 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-20 is a Class-level CWE, and the guidance discourages its use when more specific CWEs are available. However, without further details about the specific type of **input validation** that is missing or incorrect, it is difficult to select a more specific CWE. While other CWEs like CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) and CWE-1285 (Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input) were considered, the information available doesn't point to any specific type of **input validation** issue. Therefore, CWE-20 is chosen as the most appropriate, albeit generic, classification based on the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: While the name itself indicates an assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which \"permissions\" are not checked, which is an \"authorization\" weakness (CWE-285 or descendants) within CWE's model [REF-1287].\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input or data, but it does\n        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the\n        properties that are required to process the data safely and\n        correctly.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis. It is also a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
