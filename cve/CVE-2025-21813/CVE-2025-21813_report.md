# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-21813

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved timers/migration Fix off-by-one root mis-connection Before attaching a new root to the old root, the children counter of the new root is checked to verify that only the upcoming CPUs top group have been connected to it. However since the recently added commit b729cc1ec21a (timers/migration Fix another race between hotplug and idle entry/exit) this check is not valid anymore because the old root is pre-accounted as a child to the new root. Therefore after connecting the upcoming CPUs top group to the new root, the children count to be expected must be 2 and not 1 anymore. This omission results in the old root to not be connected to the new root. Then eventually the system may run with more than one top level, which defeats the purpose of a single idle migrator. Also the **old root is pre-accounted but not connected** upon the new root creation. But it can be connected to the new root later on. Therefore the old root may be accounted twice to the new root. The propagation of such overcommit can end up creating a double final top-level root with a groupmask incorrectly initialized. Although harmless given that the final top level roots will never have a parent to walk up to, this oddity opportunistically reported the core issue WARNING CPU 8 PID 0 at kernel/time/timer_migration.c543 tmigr_requires_handle_remote CPU 8 UID 0 PID 0 Comm swapper/8 RIP 0010tmigr_requires_handle_remote Call Trace ? tmigr_requires_handle_remote ? hrtimer_run_queues update_process_times tick_periodic tick_handle_periodic __sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt Fix the problem by taking the old root into account in the children count of the new root so the connection is not omitted.

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-193 | Off-by-one Error | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-835 | Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop') | 0.3 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-193 which is a base level CWE. There are no parent-child or peer relationships that greatly influenced the decision. The vulnerability description talks about an **off-by-one** error, and CWE-193 directly addresses this. CWE-835, while less directly related, was considered due to the potential for a loop to continue indefinitely if the **off-by-one** error prevents the exit condition from being met.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **off-by-one error** (CWE-193) in the children counter check. This leads to the **old root not being connected** to the new root, and potentially the system running with more than one top level. If the off-by-one error leads to a loop with an unreachable exit condition, that would be CWE-835.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an **off-by-one** error, making CWE-193 the most appropriate primary classification. The statement, "Therefore after connecting the upcoming CPUs top group to the new root, the children count to be expected must be 2 and not 1 anymore. This omission results in the old root to not be connected to the new root" is the evidence.

The retriever results suggested other CWEs like CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition), CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges), and CWE-835 (Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')). However, these CWEs don't directly capture the root cause as accurately as CWE-193. CWE-835 could be a potential secondary weakness if the incorrect children count leads to an infinite loop, but this is not explicitly stated in the description, thus the low confidence.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-193 directly describes the **off-by-one** error, and it is at the base level of abstraction.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
