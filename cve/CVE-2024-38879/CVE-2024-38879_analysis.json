This allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain direct access to the exposed application.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Improper Input Validation (CWE-20): The system fails to properly validate or restrict access to the internal application, leading to its exposure on the public interface.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Confidentiality loss: An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the exposed internal application potentially leading to disclosure of sensitive information, though the impact is limited to confidentiality.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Network-based: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by connecting to the exposed port on the public network interface.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to reach the public network interface of the affected system. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.",

CWE-306 is a base-level CWE, providing a more specific description of the **missing authentication** than its parent classes. CWE-200 was considered but not used as a primary mapping because the root cause is **missing authentication** rather than a general exposure of sensitive information. The relationship analysis also considered the guidance provided which directed the analysis to authentication CWEs if the root cause was that no login was required.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** for a critical function (CWE-306). This leads to the exposure of an internal application on the public network interface. The impact of this exposure is potential confidentiality loss due to unauthorized access (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description and CVE reference links clearly indicate that the affected system **exposes an internal application on the public network interface without requiring authentication**. This directly aligns with the definition of CWE-306, \"Missing Authentication for Critical Function.\"\n\nThe guidance clearly pointed to selecting authentication CWEs when no login was required. The retriever results also listed CWE-306 as a candidate.\n\nCWE-200, \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor,\" was considered as a secondary weakness, representing the potential impact of the **missing authentication**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-306 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the root cause and is a base-level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used**: This is not a path equivalence issue.\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used**: This is not an issue of inserting sensitive information into a file or directory.\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used**: The issue is not reliance on untrusted inputs, but **missing authentication**\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Used**: This is not a data removal issue.\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
