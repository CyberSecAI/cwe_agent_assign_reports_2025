  "description": "In invoke-ai/invokeai version v5.0.2, the web API `POST /api/v1/images/delete` is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Deletion. This vulnerability allows unauthorized attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, potentially including critical or sensitive system files such as SSH keys, SQLite databases, and configuration files. This can impact the integrity and availability of applications relying on these files.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2024-11042 Content\n\nBased on the provided content, this relates to a directory traversal vulnerability.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of image names before constructing file paths. Specifically, the code previously lacked checks to prevent attackers from using directory traversal sequences (e.g., \"../\") within image names to access files outside the intended storage directory.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Directory Traversal:** The application is susceptible to directory traversal attacks due to inadequate input validation.\n*   **Path Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate the image name to construct malicious file paths.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation could allow an attacker to:\n\n*   Access sensitive files outside the intended image storage directory.\n*   Potentially overwrite or delete critical system files (depending on permissions).\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker could supply a crafted image name containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., \"../evil.txt\") when uploading or requesting an image.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to control the image name used by the application. This could be through a file upload form, an API endpoint, or any other interface where image names are accepted.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe commit message indicates a fix has been implemented:\n\n*   The `get_path` method now includes checks to strip path information from the filename and validates that the resulting image path is relative to the base folder.\n*   A `ValueError` is raised if directory traversal is detected.\n*   The code now checks if the image path is outside the outputs folder, raising a `ValueError` if it is.\n\n**More detail than official CVE description:**\n\nYes, the content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It includes specific code changes, explanations of the vulnerability's root cause, and details about the mitigation implemented. It also includes test cases designed to verify the fix.",

CWE-22 is a parent of CWE-23 and describes a more general case of path traversal, so CWE-23 is more specific. CWE-73, External Control of File Name or Path, represents the broader issue of allowing user input to control file paths, which can lead to path traversal.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe23[\"CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    \n    cwe23 -->|CHILDOF| cwe22\n    cwe22 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe73\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe23 primary\n    class cwe22,cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with external control of the file name/path (CWE-73), which leads to **improper limitation of pathname** to a restricted directory (CWE-22), eventually resulting in **relative path traversal** (CWE-23) and arbitrary file deletion.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-23, **Relative Path Traversal**, because the vulnerability description clearly states that the web API is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to missing validation of image names, allowing attackers to use directory traversal sequences like \"../\" to access files outside the intended storage directory. This is supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\n\nThe evidence is strong, with the CVE description and analysis highlighting the root cause as insufficient validation of image names leading to directory traversal.\n\nCWE-73 and CWE-22 were considered as they are related to path manipulation and traversal, but CWE-23 is the most specific and directly reflects the **relative path traversal** vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
