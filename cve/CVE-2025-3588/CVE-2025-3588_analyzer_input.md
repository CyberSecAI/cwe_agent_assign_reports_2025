# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-3588

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in joelittlejohn jsonschema2pojo 1.2.2. This issue affects the function apply of the file org/jsonschema2pojo/rules/SchemaRule.java of the component JSON File Handler. The manipulation leads to **stack-based buffer overflow**. Attacking locally is a requirement. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## CVE-2025-3588 Analysis

The provided content is **RELATED** to a potential vulnerability in jsonschema2pojo. It details a StackOverflowError that can occur when processing a specific JSON structure, potentially leading to a denial of service.

Here's a breakdown of the information extracted from the content:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a recursive loop in the `SchemaRule.apply()` method when processing a JSON schema with a `$ref` pointing to itself (`"$ref": "#"`). The `nameFromRef()` method returns `null` in this case, causing the `apply()` method to call itself repeatedly without terminating, ultimately leading to a StackOverflowError.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Recursive Call Vulnerability:** The code doesn't handle self-referencing schemas correctly, leading to infinite recursion.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code doesn't validate the `$ref` value to prevent self-references.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A crafted JSON schema can cause the `jsonschema2pojo` tool to crash due to the StackOverflowError, preventing it from completing its task.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious JSON Schema:** An attacker can provide a specially crafted JSON schema containing a self-referencing `$ref` to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Compromised Schema Source:** If the JSON schema is fetched from an untrusted source, an attacker could modify the schema to include the malicious `$ref`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to provide a JSON schema:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a JSON schema to the `jsonschema2pojo` tool, either directly or through a source it controls.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The provided content doesn't explicitly state a fix, but the analysis suggests that the code needs to be modified to handle self-referencing schemas correctly. This could involve:

*   **Adding a check for self-references:**  Preventing the recursive call when `nameFromRef()` returns `null`.
*   **Limiting recursion depth:** Implementing a maximum recursion depth to prevent the stack from overflowing.
*   **Validating the `$ref` value:** Ensuring that the `$ref` value is a valid reference and not a self-reference.

**Additional Details:**

The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including the specific code snippet involved and a detailed explanation of the root cause. It also includes the environment details (JDK version, jsonschema2pojo versions) where the vulnerability was observed.
