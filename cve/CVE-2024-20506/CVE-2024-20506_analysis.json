  "description": "A vulnerability in the ClamD service module of Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) versions 1.4.0, 1.3.2 and prior versions, all 1.2.x versions, 1.0.6 and prior versions, all 0.105.x versions, all 0.104.x versions, and 0.103.11 and all prior versions could allow an authenticated, local attacker to corrupt critical system files. The vulnerability is due to allowing the ClamD process to write to its log file while privileged without checking if the logfile has been replaced with a symbolic link. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if they replace the ClamD log file with a symlink to a critical system file and then find a way to restart the ClamD process. An exploit could allow the attacker to corrupt a critical system file by appending ClamD log messages after restart.",

Attacker replaces the ClamD log file with a symlink.\n2.  ClamD process restarts.\n3.  ClamD process writes to the log file, which is now a symlink to a critical system file (CWE-59).\n4.

This matches CWE-59.\n\nThe evidence is based on these facts from the vulnerability description:\n*   \"The vulnerability is due to allowing the ClamD process to write to its log file while privileged without checking if the logfile has been replaced with a symbolic link.\"\n*   \"An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if they replace the ClamD log file with a symlink to a critical system file and then find a way to restart the ClamD process.\"\n*   \"An exploit could allow the attacker to corrupt a critical system file by appending ClamD log messages after restart.\"\n*   \"Root cause of vulnerability: The logging module in ClamAV was following symlinks on Linux and Unix systems.\"\n*   \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper handling of symlinks in the logging module.\"\n\nCWE-732 is considered because the vulnerability involves an **improper file permission** because the log file can be replaced with a symbolic link. However, CWE-59 is a better fit because it more specifically describes the symlink issue.\n\nCWE-367 is considered because there is a race condition involved. The attacker has to replace the log file with a symlink before the ClamD process restarts.\n\nI am confident in this assessment because it is based on the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
