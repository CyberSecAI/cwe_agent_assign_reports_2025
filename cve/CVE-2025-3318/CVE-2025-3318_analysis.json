  "description": "A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Kenj_Frog company-financial-management 1.0. Affected by this vulnerability is the function page of the file src/main/java/com/controller/ShangpinleixingController.java. The manipulation of the argument sort leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This product takes the approach of rolling releases to provide continious delivery. Therefore, version details for affected and updated releases are not available.",
