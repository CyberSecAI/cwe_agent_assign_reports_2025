This leaves a struct proto registered by `iso_init()` with `proto_register()` invalid.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n- The primary weakness is the missing cleanup operation (`iso_exit()`) upon module unload. This leads to an invalid `struct proto` registered by `proto_register()`.\\n- Failure to call `iso_exit()` before module unload.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n- The primary impact is a kernel crash, specifically a \"list\\\\_add corruption\" bug triggered by loading the module again. This is due to the corrupted state of the linked list used internally by the kernel for managing protocols.\\n- This is a data corruption issue potentially leading to an invalid kernel state.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n- The vulnerability is triggered when a Bluetooth module is loaded, then unloaded, and then loaded again. This involves actions at the module management level using `modprobe`.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n- The attacker would need to be able to load and unload kernel modules, which requires root privileges.\\n- The attacker must be able to trigger the module load and unload sequence.\\n\\n**Technical Details:**\\n- The bug manifests as a kernel panic with a detailed error message: \"list\\\\_add corruption. next->prev should be prev (ffffffffb5355fd0), but was 0000000000000068. (next=ffffffffc0a010d0).\" followed by a stack trace.\\n- The fix includes calling `iso_exit()` in the `bt_exit()` function within `net/bluetooth/af_bluetooth.c`\\n- The `CONFIG_LIST_HARDENED` and `CONFIG_BUG_ON_DATA_CORRUPTION` kernel options make this easier to reproduce.\\n- The issue is related to the BTPROTO\\\\_ISO socket type that was added in a previous commit.\\n\\nThis analysis includes more technical details than the official CVE description which is a placeholder.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '415', 'name': 'Double Free', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:iso_exit() on module unload If iso_init() has been called', 'keyphrase': 'iso_exit() on module unload If iso_init() has been called', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'rootcause:iso_exit() must be called on module unload.
