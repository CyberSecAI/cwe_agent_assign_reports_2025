## Vulnerability Description
The Animation Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Sensitive Information Exposure** in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.6 via the render function in widgets/content-slider.php and widgets/tabs.php. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract sensitive private, pending, and draft Elementor template data.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper access control**
- **weakness:** **Sensitive Information Exposure**
- **impact:** extract sensitive private and pending and and draft Elementor template data
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access and above
- **product:** Animation Addons for Elementor WordPress plugin
- **version:** all versions up to and including 1.1.6
- **component:** render function in widgets/content-slider.php and widgets/tabs.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
### Summary:
The provided content describes a vulnerability in the Animation Addons for Elementor WordPress plugin, specifically versions 1.1.6 and earlier. This vulnerability allows authenticated users with Contributor-level access or higher to extract sensitive information from Elementor templates through the Content Slider and Tabs widgets.

### Root Cause of Vulnerability:
The vulnerability stems from the `render` function within the `widgets/content-slider.php` and `widgets/tabs.php` files. These functions, when rendering Elementor templates, did not check if the templates were publicly accessible (published), allowing users to access private, pending, and draft templates.

### Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The plugin exposes potentially sensitive data of Elementor templates.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The plugin lacks proper access control checks for template visibility, allowing contributors and higher-level users to bypass restrictions on accessing unpublished templates.

### Impact of Exploitation:
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in:
- **Data Leakage:** Attackers can access private content, including drafts and pending posts/pages, potentially containing sensitive or confidential information.
- **Unintended Disclosure:** Exposure of unfinished content, which may not be ready for public consumption.

### Attack Vectors:
The attack vector involves manipulating the `render` function of the Content Slider and Tabs widgets. This can be done by an attacker with an account that has at least Contributor level access. They can then insert an Elementor template into the widget and access the template data even if it's unpublished.

### Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site.
- **Contributor Level Access or Higher:** The attacker's user role must be Contributor or higher to exploit this vulnerability.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
