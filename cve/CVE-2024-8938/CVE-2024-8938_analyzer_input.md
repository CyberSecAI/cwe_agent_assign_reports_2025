# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-8938

## Vulnerability Description
CWE-119 **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer** vulnerability exists that could cause a potential arbitrary code execution after a successful Man-In-The-Middle attack followed by sending a crafted Modbus function call to tamper with memory area involved in memory size computation.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**
- **impact:** arbitrary code execution
- **vector:** crafted Modbus function call
- **attacker:** attacker

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-8938:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer". This means the software does not properly validate the size or boundaries of data being written to a memory buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-119:** Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer. This is a classic buffer overflow vulnerability where writing beyond allocated memory space can lead to overwriting other memory regions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution. This means an attacker can run their own malicious code on the controller.
- **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The vulnerability allows for the potential loss of confidentiality (reading sensitive data), integrity (tampering with controller settings and functions) and availability (disrupting controller operation/denial of service).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** A successful MitM attack is a prerequisite. This means an attacker has to intercept communication between the controller and other devices on the network.
- **Crafted Modbus Function Call:**  After a successful MitM, the attacker needs to send a crafted Modbus function call specifically designed to exploit the memory buffer vulnerability. This crafted call targets the memory area involved in memory size computation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Modicon controller's network (at least to port 502/TCP, the Modbus port).
- **MitM Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify Modbus communication between the controller and other devices.
- **Knowledge of Modbus Protocol:** The attacker needs to have detailed knowledge of the Modbus protocol to create the crafted function calls.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Area:** The attacker needs to know which memory area is involved in memory size computations to effectively target the crafted Modbus request.
