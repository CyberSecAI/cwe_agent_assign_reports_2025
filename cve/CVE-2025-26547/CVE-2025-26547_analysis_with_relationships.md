# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2025-26547

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | 1.0 | Compound | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship identified is that CSRF (**CWE-352**) can lead to other vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (**CWE-79**) if successfully exploited. While **CWE-352** is a compound weakness, it accurately represents the **missing CSRF protection** which is the root cause. **CWE-79** is a base weakness, and while XSS is an impact, it is a direct result of the **missing CSRF protection**, making it a valid secondary candidate.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing CSRF protection** (**CWE-352**). This allows an attacker to forge requests, leading to the execution of unwanted actions by a privileged user. The injected request can introduce malicious scripts, which results in Stored XSS (**CWE-79**). Thus, the chain is: **CWE-352** -> **CWE-79**.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, particularly the vulnerability description highlighting the **missing CSRF protection** and the CVE reference links content summary emphasizing the CSRF vulnerability. The retriever results also list **CWE-352** and **CWE-79** as top candidates.

The graph relationships confirm that a **missing CSRF protection** can lead to XSS.

**CWE-352** is selected as the primary CWE because the root cause is the **missing CSRF protection**, which allows an attacker to perform actions on behalf of another user, leading to further exploitation such as XSS. **CWE-79** is a secondary impact that can result from **CWE-352**.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. **CWE-352** accurately represents the **missing CSRF protection**, and **CWE-79** accurately describes the resulting XSS vulnerability.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-862: Missing Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
