CWE-863 is a more specific child of CWE-285, providing a better fit for describing the **incorrect** authorization issue. Both CWEs address authorization problems, but CWE-863 is preferred when the authorization mechanism is present but flawed.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect** location of method security annotations on private methods by Spring Security Aspects. This leads to the target method being invoked without proper authorization, resulting in an authorization bypass.\n  - **Root Cause**: **Spring Security Aspects may not correctly locate method security annotations on private methods**\n  - **Weakness**: Authorization bypass due to incorrect handling of method security annotations on private methods.\n  - **Impact**: The target method may be able to be invoked without proper authorization.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis focuses on the root cause and impact of the vulnerability. The root cause, \"Spring Security Aspects may not correctly locate method security annotations on private methods,\" directly leads to an authorization bypass. The evidence strongly supports CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as the primary CWE because the authorization check is present, but it's performed incorrectly. The analysis is heavily based on the provided evidence. The relationship between CWE-285 and CWE-863 was considered, with CWE-863 chosen for its greater specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
