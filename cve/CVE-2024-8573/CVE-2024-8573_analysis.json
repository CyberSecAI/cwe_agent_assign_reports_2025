  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in TOTOLINK AC1200 T8 and AC1200 T10 4.1.5cu.861_B20230220/4.1.8cu.5207. This affects the function setParentalRules of the file /cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi. The manipulation of the argument desc leads to **buffer overflow**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `setParentalRules` function of the TOTOLINK AC1200 T8 router firmware.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Buffer Overflow:** The `strcpy` function is used to copy the `desc` parameter from a POST request into the `v6` variable without proper bounds checking. This allows an attacker to write beyond the allocated memory for the `v6` variable.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service condition, potentially crashing the device or making it unresponsive.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint with the `topicurl` set to `setParentalRules` and a long string in the `desc` parameter.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router's web interface. This could potentially be done from a device on the same local network or, if the router's web interface is exposed to the internet, from a remote location.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- The vulnerable firmware version is `T8_Firmware V4.1.5cu.861_B20230220`.\n- The `desc` parameter within the POST request is the user-controlled input that causes the buffer overflow when copied to `v6` variable via `strcpy`.\n- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability using a Python script. The POC sends a POST request with a `desc` parameter consisting of 0x1000 'b' characters.\n\nThe provided information is more detailed than the standard CVE description placeholder.",

The **strcpy** function is used to copy data without proper bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow. |\n| CWE-121 | Stack-based Buffer Overflow | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary candidate.

The vulnerability involves writing outside the intended buffer boundary. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-120, which represents a classic buffer overflow due to copying data without checking the size of the input. CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) is a variant of a buffer overflow where the buffer is located on the stack, making it a more specific case of CWE-119. CWE-119 is a more general class that encompasses various memory boundary violations.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input\"]\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe120 primary\n    class cwe121,cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper use of `strcpy`**, leading to a **buffer overflow** and potentially causing a **denial of service**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based on the detailed information provided in the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" which clearly indicates that the vulnerability is a **buffer overflow** due to the **improper use of the `strcpy` function** without bounds checking when handling the `desc` parameter in the `setParentalRules` function.\n\nThe evidence is strong, indicating that CWE-120 is the most appropriate primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: a buffer copy operation without checking the size of the input. CWE-121 is considered as a secondary candidate because the overflow occurs on the stack.\n\nThe selection of CWE-120 is based on the MITRE mapping guidance, which suggests that this CWE is appropriate for buffer copy operations where there is no size checking, leading to writing past the end of the buffer.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Used*: This CWE does not apply because the vulnerability is due to missing bounds checking, not filtering of special elements.\n\n## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Used*: This CWE is a strong secondary candidate because the buffer is allocated on the stack\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used*: While a potential cause, the primary issue is the missing bounds check during the copy operation rather than an incorrect size calculation\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
