## Vulnerability Description
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the adm.cgi set_wzap() functionality of Wavlink AC3000 M33A8.V5030.210505. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to **stack-based buffer overflow**. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack-based buffer overflow**
- **vector:** specially crafted HTTP request
- **product:** Wavlink AC3000
- **version:** M33A8.V5030.210505
- **component:** adm.cgi set_wzap() functionality

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## CVE-2024-39358 Analysis

The content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2024-39358. It provides a detailed vulnerability report from Talos Intelligence. Here's the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `adm.cgi`'s `set_wzdap()` function of the Wavlink AC3000 router.
*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of length checking on input buffers when processing HTTP POST requests. Specifically, the `wlan_ssid2g` parameter is copied to the stack without size validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   CWE-120 - Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input (‘Classic Buffer Overflow’)
*   Stack-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can overwrite the return address of the `set_wzdap` function.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `adm.cgi` endpoint.
*   Requires authenticated access (HTTP request with a valid session cookie).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Network access to the Wavlink AC3000 router.
*   Authenticated access to the router's web interface (valid session cookie).

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The report does not explicitly state a fix, but implies patching is being worked on by the vendor. The product has been discontinued, but patches are being developed.

**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**

*   **Affected Product:** Wavlink AC3000 M33A8.V5030.210505
*   **CVSSv3 Score:** 9.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)
*   The vulnerability is triggered by providing a `page=wzdap` parameter in an HTTP POST request.
*   The `set_wzdap` function calls `strdup` on several parameters obtained from the HTTP request, including `wlan_ssid2g`, which is vulnerable to overflow.
*   The report includes GDB debugging information and crash details.
*   Timeline of vendor communication and disclosure.
*   Discovered by Lilith >\_> of Cisco Talos.
