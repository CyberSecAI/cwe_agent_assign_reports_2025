## Vulnerability Description
The Slider & Popup Builder by Depicter plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to generic SQL Injection via the s parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.1 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**

- **impact:** extract sensitive information from the database and append additional SQL queries
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **product:** Slider & Popup Builder by Depicter
- **version:** all versions up to and including 3.6.1

**1. Does the content relate to the CVE specified based on the official description?**

YES. The content explicitly states: "The Slider & Popup Builder by Depicter plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to generic SQL Injection via the ‘s' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.1".  This aligns directly with the CVE description.

**2. Relevant content extraction:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient escaping on the user-supplied parameter and a lack of sufficient preparation in the SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Generic SQL Injection
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Allows unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries to extract sensitive information from the database.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via the ‘s' parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Unauthenticated attackers.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** The content references a fix, specifically versions after 3.6.1.

**Content from github.com\_8e272f8f\_20250624\_233249.html (stripped)**

*   This content confirms the SQL injection vulnerability in the Depicter plugin, version 3.6.1, and provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) environment, including setup instructions and testing commands.

    *   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Implicitly confirms the root cause as it targets a parameter.
    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
    *   **Impact of exploitation:**  Extraction of admin details, execution of custom SQL queries.
    *   **Attack vectors:**  Exploits the vulnerability using a PoC script (`poc.py`) against the `http://localhost:5555` URL.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs access to the vulnerable WordPress installation, and the ability to run the PoC script.
    *   **Mitigation or fix:** The vulnerable version is 3.6.1, implied that versions greater than 3.6.1 fix the vulnerability.

**Content from plugins.trac.wordpress.org\_1642f21e\_20250624\_233256.html (stripped)**

*   This content reveals the source code of `LeadsAjaxController.php` in the Depicter plugin and shows the use of `Sanitize::textfield()` on the `s` parameter. The vulnerability arises because the sanitization is insufficient to prevent SQL injection.

    *   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient sanitization (`Sanitize::textfield`) of the `s` parameter.
    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
    *   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via the ‘s' parameter.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A malicious actor can exploit a vulnerability by manipulating the `s` parameter.
    *   **Mitigation or fix:** The fix involves replacing `Sanitize::textfield` with `Sanitize::sql` (in the changeset 3287525), which provides better protection against SQL injection.

**Content from plugins.trac.wordpress.org\_63ca2307\_20250624\_233300.html (stripped)**

*   This content reveals the source code of `LeadRepository.php` in the Depicter plugin. It shows how the `delete` method is used to delete leads and how it uses `Sanitize::int()` on the `$id` variable.

    *   **Root cause of vulnerability:** While `Sanitize::int()` is applied to the `$id` parameter, this code is not directly related to the identified SQL injection vulnerability via the 's' parameter, and doesn't expose the root cause
    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Not related to the SQL injection vulnerability.
    *   **Impact of exploitation:** Not related to the SQL injection vulnerability.
    *   **Attack vectors:** N/A
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** N/A
    *   **Mitigation or fix:** N/A

**Content from plugins.trac.wordpress.org\_6f6d8207\_20250624\_233308.html (stripped)**

*   This content reveals the source code of `LeadService.php` in the Depicter plugin and how the `add` method is used to add leads.
    *   **Root cause of vulnerability:** This code is not directly related to the identified SQL injection vulnerability via the 's' parameter and doesn't expose the root cause
    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Not related to the SQL injection vulnerability.
    *   **Impact of exploitation:** Not related to the SQL injection vulnerability.
    *   **Attack vectors:** N/A
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** N/A
    *   **Mitigation or fix:** N/A

**Content from plugins.trac.wordpress.org\_bee1f806\_20250624\_233256.html (stripped)**

*   This content provides the source code of `LeadsAjaxController.php` in the Depicter plugin, which handles AJAX requests related to leads. It reveals the use of `Sanitize::textfield` on the 's' parameter within the `index`, `list`, and `export` methods. It also shows the fix in changeset 3287525, where `Sanitize::textfield` is replaced with `Sanitize::sql` to address the SQL injection vulnerability.

    *   **Root cause of vulnerability:**  Insufficient sanitization of the `s` parameter using `Sanitize::textfield`.
    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  SQL Injection.
    *   **Impact of exploitation:** Allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `s` parameter, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the database.
    *   **Attack vectors:** Sending crafted requests to the AJAX endpoints that utilize the 's' parameter.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable AJAX endpoints and manipulate the 's' parameter.
    *   **Mitigation or fix:** Replacing `Sanitize::textfield` with `Sanitize::sql` in the code.
