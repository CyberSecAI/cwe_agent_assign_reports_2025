# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-327, which is a Class-level CWE. While it would be ideal to have a Base or Variant level CWE, there isn't sufficient information to determine which specific algorithm is broken or risky. CWE-327 relates to CWE-319 because using a broken algorithm can lead to sensitive information being transmitted in cleartext. CWE-327 also has a parent relationship with CWE-1240 (Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation), which is more specific but not directly supported by the evidence.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **use of obsolete algorithms** (CWE-327). This leads to the **potential for attackers to obtain plaintext SNMPv3 credentials** (CWE-319).
  - The **root cause** is the **obsolete algorithms** (CWE-327).
  - The **impact** is the **potential to obtain plaintext SNMPv3 credentials** (CWE-319).

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identifies CWE-327 as the primary weakness because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **use of obsolete algorithms**. This aligns directly with CWE-327's description. The secondary weakness, CWE-319, arises as a consequence of using these weak algorithms, leading to the **potential transmission of sensitive information in cleartext**.

The analysis relies heavily on the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**, specifically the **rootcause: obsolete algorithms for authentication protocol and encryption protocol** which suggests the use of weak or broken algorithms.

The graph relationships, particularly the child-of relationship between CWE-1240 and CWE-327, were considered. However, due to the lack of specific information about the cryptographic primitive used, CWE-327 was deemed more appropriate.

The selection of CWE-327 is at the optimal level of specificity given the available evidence. While more specific variants exist, they require detailed knowledge of the exact cryptographic flaws, which is not provided in the description.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 1163.21
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
