  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2024-26020 based on provided content:\n\nThis content **IS RELATED** to CVE-2024-26020 and provides significantly more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the way Anki (version 24.04) handles media files played through MPV on Windows. Specifically, it allows for arbitrary arguments to be passed directly to the MPV command-line interface.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **CWE-74 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component (\u2018Injection\u2019):**  The vulnerability is a script injection flaw.\n*   The Anki application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing the command to execute MPV.\n*   MPV's ability to load and execute Lua scripts via configuration files.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation leads to **full command injection on the user's system**. This means an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Anki.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker can craft a malicious flashcard containing a specially crafted `[sound:]` tag.\n*   The crafted tag includes a reference to a configuration file (`extra.conf`) that instructs MPV to load and execute a Lua script (`run.lua`).\n*   The attacker bundles the malicious `extra.conf` and `run.lua` files within the Anki media folder of the deck.\n*   When a user imports the deck (and its media), the malicious script is executed by MPV.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious Anki deck containing the crafted flashcard and associated files.\n*   The attacker relies on the user importing the malicious deck and its media.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The vendor released a patch for Anki in version 24.04 on June 24, 2024.  Users are advised to update to the patched version.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **CVSSv3 Score:** 9.6 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) - indicating a critical severity.\n*   The exploit leverages MPV's configuration file loading mechanism to execute arbitrary Lua scripts.\n*   The `[sound:--include=extra.conf]` tag is used to inject the malicious configuration file.\n*   The `extra.conf` file contains instructions to load and execute the `run.lua` script.\n*   The `idle=yes` parameter in `extra.conf` prevents MPV from closing immediately, allowing the script to complete execution.\n*   Discovered by Autumn Bee Skerritt of Cisco Duo Security and Jacob B.",

The Anki application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing the command to execute MPV leading to code injection. |\n| CWE-74 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection') | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability is a script injection flaw but CWE-94 is more precise. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the selection was the parent-child relationship between CWE-74 and CWE-94. While CWE-74 broadly describes injection issues, CWE-94 specifically addresses code injection, which is a more accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe94 primary\n    class cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of user-supplied input**, leading to **command injection** and culminating in **arbitrary code execution**.\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') (CWE-94)** - The Anki application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing the command to execute MPV.\n2.  **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the user's system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided content, specifically the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section. The key evidence supporting the selection of CWE-94 is the statement that \"The Anki application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing the command to execute MPV\" and that this leads to \"full command injection on the user's system\". This directly aligns with the description of CWE-94, which focuses on the **improper control of code generation** due to **unsanitized input**.\n\nThe relationship between CWE-74 and CWE-94 was crucial in determining the most specific and accurate CWE. While CWE-74 is a broader category encompassing various injection flaws, CWE-94 specifically targets code injection, making it a more precise fit for this vulnerability. The evidence clearly indicates that the vulnerability involves injecting code, not just any type of special element, justifying the selection of CWE-94.\n\nThe retriever results also support this conclusion, with CWE-94 having a high relevance score (0.502). While some other CWEs were considered, they were either too broad (e.g., CWE-20, CWE-74) or did not directly address the root cause of the vulnerability (e.g., CWE-120, CWE-78).\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause (CWE-94) and provide additional context about the nature of the vulnerability (CWE-74). They are not overly broad or generic, nor are they so specific that they miss the overall nature of the flaw.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
