This is a Class-level CWE. CWE-862 is related to other authorization-related CWEs such as CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization). CWE-285 is a parent of both CWE-862 and CWE-863.

This leads to the impact of teachers being able to modify student personal data without proper authorization.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the issue is due to **missing access control checks** in the student editing functionality. This directly corresponds to CWE-862 (Missing Authorization). The guidance also supports that if there's no role/privilege check after login, then CWE-862 is the proper mapping. The retriever results also had CWE-862 as the top match. The evidence provided is strong and directly supports the selection of CWE-862 as the primary weakness.\n\nCWE-285 was considered because it is a broader category for improper authorization, but CWE-862 is more specific and accurately describes the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-306 was considered because **missing access control checks** can sometimes be related to **missing authentication checks**. However, the description specifically mentions authorization checks, making CWE-862 a better fit.",
