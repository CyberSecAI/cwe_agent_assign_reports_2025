## Vulnerability Description
xfpt versions prior to 1.01 fails to handle appropriately some parameters inside the input data, resulting in a **stack-based buffer overflow** vulnerability. When a user of the affected product is tricked to process a specially crafted file, arbitrary code may be executed on the users environment.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack-based buffer overflow**
- **impact:** arbitrary code execution
- **vector:** specially crafted file
- **product:** xfpt
- **version:** prior to 1.01
