  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Weaver e-cology 8. It has been classified as problematic. Affected is an unknown function of the file /cloudstore/ecode/setup/ecology_dev.zip of the component Source Code Handler. The manipulation leads to information disclosure. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. NOTE The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access controls on the `/cloudstore/ecode/setup/ecology_dev.zip` file in Weaver e-cology 8. This allows unauthorized users to download the file.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the `ecology_dev.zip` file, which is likely to contain sensitive information about the system, potentially including source code and configuration data.\n*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The vulnerability can be classified as an Insecure Direct Object Reference, as the system allows direct access to a sensitive file without proper authorization checks.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** Attackers can obtain the `ecology_dev.zip` file, which could contain source code, configuration files, or other sensitive data.\n*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** The disclosed information could be used to discover additional vulnerabilities, leading to further compromise of the system. This could lead to remote code execution, data breaches, or other malicious activities.\n*   **Compromise of Intellectual Property:** If the zip file contains proprietary source code, its disclosure could lead to theft of intellectual property.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Direct File Request:** An attacker can directly request the vulnerable file via a web browser or other HTTP clients. The vulnerable URL is: `/cloudstore/ecode/setup/ecology_dev.zip`\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs to have network access to the system running the vulnerable Weaver e-cology 8 application. No authentication seems to be required to download the file.\n*   **Basic Web Skills:**  The attacker needs to be able to formulate a URL request.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe provided information describes an information disclosure vulnerability in Weaver e-cology 8, where an unauthenticated user can download the `ecology_dev.zip` file by directly accessing its URL. This file is likely to contain sensitive information, including source code, configuration files, or other proprietary data which could be further exploited by a malicious actor.",
