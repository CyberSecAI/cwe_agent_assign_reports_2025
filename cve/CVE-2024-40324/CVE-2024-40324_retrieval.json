Specifically, the application allows Carriage Return (CR) and Line Feed (LF) characters to be injected into input fields.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\\n\\n*   **CRLF Injection:** The core vulnerability is the ability to inject CRLF characters. These characters are crucial for delineating HTTP headers and body, and their injection can lead to response splitting.\\n*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application lacks proper input validation and sanitization, allowing the injection of control characters.\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n\\n*   **HTTP Response Splitting:** Attackers can inject malicious headers and control the content of the response, leading to various attacks.\\n*   **Arbitrary Header Injection:** Attackers can add or modify HTTP headers.\\n*   **Cache Poisoning:** By manipulating headers, an attacker might be able to cause a proxy or other caching mechanism to store a malicious response.\\n*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers might manipulate headers to steal or hijack user sessions.\\n*    **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The document mentions XSS as a potential impact of the header manipulation.\\n*   **Code Execution (Potential):**  The document states the impact as \"Impact Code execution\" although it is unclear how this is achieved directly via the CRLF injection.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n\\n*   **Remote:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning an attacker doesn\\'t need physical access to the server.\\n*   **Input Field Injection:** Attackers inject CRLF sequences into input fields that are used to construct HTTP headers. The provided example states that CRLF can be injected into HTTP headers, which is the attack vector to achieve response splitting.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n\\n*   The attacker needs the ability to supply input to the vulnerable application.\\n*   The attacker can be remote.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats':
