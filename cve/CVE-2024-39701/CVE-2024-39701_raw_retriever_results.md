# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-39701
## Query
Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Directus >=9.23.0, <=v10.5.3 improperly handles _in, _nin operators. It evaluates empty arrays as valid so expressions like {role {_in $CURRENT_USER.some_field}} would evaluate to true allowing the request to pass. This results in Broken Access Control because the rule fails to do what it was intended to do Pass rule if **field** matches any of the **values**. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.6.0.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'improperly handles _in', '_nin operators'
