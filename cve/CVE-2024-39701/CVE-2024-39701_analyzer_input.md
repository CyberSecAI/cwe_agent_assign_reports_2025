# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-39701

## Vulnerability Description
Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Directus >=9.23.0, <=v10.5.3 **improperly handles _in, _nin operators**. It evaluates empty arrays as valid so expressions like {role {_in $CURRENT_USER.some_field}} would evaluate to true allowing the request to pass. This results in Broken Access Control because the rule fails to do what it was intended to do Pass rule if **field** matches any of the **values**. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.6.0.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improperly handles _in, _nin operators**
- **impact:** Broken Access Control
- **product:** Directus
- **version:** >=9.23.0, <=v10.5.3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the incorrect handling of the `_in` and `_nin` filter operators in Directus versions between 9.23.0 and 10.5.3. Specifically, these operators incorrectly evaluate empty arrays as valid matches.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is a failure in access control. The system allows access based on faulty logic in filter rules. Empty arrays passed to `_in` operator cause the filter to incorrectly pass, granting unintended access.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** Directus fails to properly validate filter rules leading to unintended behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Exploiting this vulnerability can allow users to gain access to resources or functionalities that they are not supposed to. This can lead to users being able to perform actions or view data they are not authorized to.
*  **Privilege Escalation:**  In a real world scenario, users could potentially elevate their privileges and gain access to administrative functions/data through the access control bypass.
*   **Data Exposure:** Attackers might gain unauthorized access to sensitive information due to the broken access controls.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **Filter Manipulation:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by manipulating filter rules, specifically by using the `_in` or `_nin` operator with empty arrays. This could be done through requests made to the Directus API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privilege Access:** The attacker needs some access to the system, but doesn't need administrative privileges.
*   **Knowledge of Directus:** The attacker needs some understanding of how Directus filter rules and operators function.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided content includes a specific PoC demonstrating the vulnerability using a role-chooser extension, showing how a user with no role can set their role due to the validation rule failing with null values.
* The CVSS score of 6.3 is given as "Moderate".
* The advisory also includes CVSS v3 base metrics (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N) which can help in assessing its impact.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 10.6.0 and later of Directus.
* The report also mentions that the vulnerability is tracked under CVE-2024-39701

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
