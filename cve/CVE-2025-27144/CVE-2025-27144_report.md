# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-27144

## Description

Go JOSE provides an implementation of the Javascript Object Signing and Encryption set of standards in Go, including support for JSON Web Encryption (JWE), JSON Web Signature (JWS), and JSON Web Token (JWT) standards. In versions on the 4.x branch prior to version 4.0.5, when parsing compact JWS or JWE input, Go JOSE could use excessive memory. The code used strings.Split(token, .) to split JWT tokens, which is vulnerable to **excessive memory consumption** when processing maliciously crafted tokens with a large number of `.` characters. An attacker could exploit this by sending numerous malformed tokens, leading to memory exhaustion and a Denial of Service. Version 4.0.5 fixes this issue. As a workaround, applications could pre-validate that payloads passed to Go JOSE do not contain an excessive number of `.` characters.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Weakness:** excessive memory consumption
- **Impact:** Denial of Service
- **Vector:** maliciously crafted tokens with a large number of `.` characters
- **Product:** Go JOSE
- **Version:** 4.x branch prior to version 4.0.5

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-789 | Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE. The code allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated. |
| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability leads to excessive memory consumption, which is a form of uncontrolled resource consumption leading to DoS. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value)**, which is a variant of **CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling)** and is related to **CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption)** as a consequence of the excessive memory allocation. **CWE-789** is a more specific variant of **CWE-770**, which is a child of **CWE-400**.

```

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the use of `strings.Split(token, ".")` to split JWT tokens. This leads to **CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value)**, because an attacker can craft a token with a large number of '.' characters, leading to **excessive memory consumption** and, ultimately, **CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption)**, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided evidence, which includes the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The key phrase "**excessive memory consumption**" directly points to memory allocation issues. The CVE reference summary confirms that the code splits JWT tokens in a way that is vulnerable to excessive memory consumption when processing maliciously crafted tokens.

The retriever results also indicate **CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value)** as a potential candidate, and after careful consideration, it is the most appropriate primary CWE. Other CWEs like **CWE-834 (Excessive Iteration)** and **CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion)** are less relevant because the core issue is related to memory allocation rather than iteration or recursion. **CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption)** is also relevant as a consequence of the **excessive memory consumption**.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because **CWE-789** is a Variant-level CWE, providing a detailed description of the **memory allocation** issue, and **CWE-400** represents the broader impact of resource consumption.
