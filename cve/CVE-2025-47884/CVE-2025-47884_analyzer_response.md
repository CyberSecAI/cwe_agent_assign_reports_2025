# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-47884

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-526 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in an Environment Variable | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-639 | Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the selection was the hierarchical relationship between CWE-526 and its parent CWEs. While several other CWEs were considered due to their relevance to authorization and information exposure, CWE-526 directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: the use of environment variables to store sensitive information in cleartext, which then leads to the ability to craft tokens.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper use of environment variables** to store sensitive information (**CWE-526**). This leads to the possibility of attackers **overriding these variables** and crafting build ID Tokens, ultimately resulting in an **authorization bypass** (**CWE-639**) and unauthorized access to external services.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **use of overridden environment variables** in generating build ID Tokens. This led to the selection of CWE-526 as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **cleartext storage of sensitive information in environment variables**. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions "potentially overridden values of environment variables".

The retriever results also pointed to other relevant CWEs, such as CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), and CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key). However, these CWEs describe the symptoms or consequences of the vulnerability rather than the root cause.

CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) was considered as a secondary CWE because the ability to override environment variables and craft tokens allows attackers to bypass authorization checks and gain unauthorized access.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause and the resulting impact of the vulnerability. CWE-526 is a Variant that specifically addresses the **cleartext storage of sensitive information in environment variables**, while CWE-639 describes the resulting **authorization bypass**.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-862: Missing Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
