  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-7533:\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-after-free in the Sharing component of Google Chrome.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free (UAF). This occurs when a program attempts to access memory that has already been freed, potentially leading to crashes or unexpected behavior.\n*  **Impact of exploitation:** The content does not specify the exact impact beyond being a \"High\" severity issue. However, UAF vulnerabilities can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited successfully.\n*   **Attack vectors:** The content does not provide specific attack vectors. It's only mentioned that it occurs within the \"Sharing\" component.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The content does not describe the specific attacker capabilities or position required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was reported by lime(@limeSec\\_) from TIANGONG Team of Legendsec at QI-ANXIN Group on 2024-07-17\n*   The fix was included in Chrome version 127.0.6533.99/.100 for Windows, Mac, and 127.0.6533.99 for Linux.\n*   A reward of $11,000 was given for reporting this vulnerability.",
