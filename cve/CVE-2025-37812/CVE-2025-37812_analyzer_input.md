# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-37812

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved usb cdns3 Fix **deadlock** when using NCM gadget The cdns3 driver has the same NCM **deadlock** as fixed in cdnsp by commit 58f2fcb3a845 (usb cdnsp Fix **deadlock** issue during using NCM gadget). Under PREEMPT_RT the **deadlock** can be readily triggered by heavy network traffic, for example using iperf --bidir over NCM ethernet link. The **deadlock** occurs because the threaded interrupt handler gets preempted by a softirq, but both are protected by the same spinlock. Prevent **deadlock** by disabling softirq during threaded irq handler.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **spinlock protection in threaded interrupt handler and softirq**
- **weakness:** **deadlock**
- **impact:** deadlock
- **vector:** heavy network traffic
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** cdns3 driver
