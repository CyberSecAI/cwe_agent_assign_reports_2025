  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved usb cdns3 Fix **deadlock** when using NCM gadget The cdns3 driver has the same NCM **deadlock** as fixed in cdnsp by commit 58f2fcb3a845 (usb cdnsp Fix **deadlock** issue during using NCM gadget). Under PREEMPT_RT the **deadlock** can be readily triggered by heavy network traffic, for example using iperf --bidir over NCM ethernet link. The **deadlock** occurs because the threaded interrupt handler gets preempted by a softirq, but both are protected by the same spinlock. Prevent **deadlock** by disabling softirq during threaded irq handler.",

This is caused by concurrent execution and improper locking mechanisms. CWE-362 and CWE-667 are related as they describe the conditions that can lead to a **deadlock**. CWE-362 is a class-level CWE, with potential base-level children providing more specific details about the race condition. Similarly, CWE-667 is a class-level CWE, and more specific locking issues could be represented by its children. The relationship between these CWEs helps to understand the vulnerability's context, with CWE-833 being the manifestation of the problem and CWE-362 and CWE-667 being contributing factors.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe833[\"CWE-833: Deadlock\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    \n    cwe833 <--|CAUSED_BY| cwe362\n    cwe833 <--|CAUSED_BY| cwe667\n    cwe362 -->|PARENT_OF| cwe367\n    cwe667 -->|PARENT_OF| cwe413\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe833 primary\n    class cwe362,cwe667 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper synchronization** (CWE-362) and **improper locking** (CWE-667) of shared resources in a concurrent environment. This leads to a **deadlock** (CWE-833) when threads or processes wait indefinitely for each other to release locks.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-833 as the primary weakness, which aligns with the description of the vulnerability as a **deadlock**. This **deadlock** is a direct result of the **spinlock protection in threaded interrupt handler and softirq**.\n\nThe retriever results also support this, with CWE-833 having a high score. The vulnerability description clearly states that the **deadlock** occurs because the threaded interrupt handler gets preempted by a softirq, but both are protected by the same spinlock. This points to a concurrency issue where multiple threads are contending for the same resource (spinlock) without proper synchronization.\n\nCWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')) and CWE-667 (Improper Locking) are considered secondary because they describe the conditions contributing to the **deadlock**. The graph relationships show that CWE-362 and CWE-667 can lead to CWE-833.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity. CWE-833 is a Base-level CWE, representing the specific **deadlock** condition. While more specific child CWEs of CWE-362 or CWE-667 might exist, the provided information does not contain the level of detail required to make that determination.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-833: Deadlock\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in **deadlock**.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why this CWE was selected:** This perfectly matches the vulnerability description which explicitly mentions a **deadlock** condition.\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Why this CWE was selected:** This is potentially a contributing factor to the deadlock since the description mentions spinlocks.\n\n## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Pillar\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.\n\n**Why this CWE was NOT selected:** This is too general of a CWE.\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n**Why this CWE was selected:** This could be a contributing factor to the **deadlock**.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
