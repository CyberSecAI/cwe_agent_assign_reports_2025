All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2009-0935: Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice\n\n- CVE-2010-4210: function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.\n\n- CVE-2008-4302: Chain: OS kernel does not properly handle a failure of a function call (CWE-755), leading to an unlock of a resource that was not locked (CWE-832), with resultant crash.\n\n- CVE-2009-1243: OS kernel performs an unlock in some incorrect circumstances, leading to panic.\n\n- CVE-2009-2857: OS deadlock\n\n- CVE-2009-1961: OS deadlock involving 3 separate functions\n\n- CVE-2009-2699: deadlock in library\n\n- CVE-2009-4272: deadlock triggered by packets that force collisions in a routing table\n\n- CVE-2002-1850: read/write deadlock between web server and script\n\n- CVE-2004-0174: web server deadlock involving multiple listening connections\n\n- CVE-2009-1388: multiple simultaneous calls to the same function trigger deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2006-5158: chain: other weakness leads to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) or deadlock (CWE-833).\n\n- CVE-2006-4342: deadlock when an operation is performed on a resource while it is being removed.\n\n- CVE-2006-2374: Deadlock in device driver triggered by using file handle of a related device.\n\n- CVE-2006-2275: Deadlock when large number of small messages cannot be processed quickly enough.\n\n- CVE-2005-3847: OS kernel has deadlock triggered by a signal during a core dump.\n\n- CVE-2005-3106: Race condition leads to deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2005-2456: Chain: array index error (CWE-129) leads to deadlock (CWE-833)\n\n- CVE-2001-0682: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a mutex.\n\n- CVE-2002-1914: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.\n\n- CVE-2002-1915: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.\n\n- CVE-2002-0051: Critical file can be opened with exclusive read access by user, preventing application of security policy.

Resultant from permissions and randomness.\n\n- CVE-2000-1198: Chain: Lock files with predictable names. Resultant from randomness.\n\n- CVE-2002-1869: Product does not check if it can write to a log file, allowing attackers to avoid logging by accessing the file using an exclusive lock. Overlaps unchecked error condition. This is not quite CWE-412, but close.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0529: In memory management driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android SoCAndroid ID: A-185195268\n\n- CVE-2021-0625: In ccu, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS05594996; Issue ID: ALPS05594996.\n\n- CVE-2020-27014: Trend Micro Antivirus for Mac 2020 (Consumer) contains a race condition vulnerability in the Web Threat Protection Blocklist component, that if exploited, could allow an attacker to case a kernel panic or crash.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAn attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: A race condition was addressed with improved locking. This issue is fixed in macOS Big Sur 11.2, Security Update 2021-001 Catalina, Security Update 2021-001 Mojave, watchOS 7.3, tvOS 14.4, iOS 14.4 and iPadOS 14.4. A malicious application may be able to elevate privileges. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited..\n\n- CVE-2021-31961: Windows InstallService Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26708: A local privilege escalation was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.10.13. Multiple race conditions in the AF_VSOCK implementation are caused by wrong locking in net/vmw_vsock/af_vsock.c. The race conditions were implicitly introduced in the commits that added VSOCK multi-transport support.\n\n- CVE-2021-0330: In add_user_ce and remove_user_ce of storaged.cpp, there is a possible use-after-free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in storaged with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-9 Android-10 Android-11Android ID: A-170732441\n\n- CVE-2021-0940: In TBD of TBD, there is a possible out of bounds write due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in the kernel with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-171315276References: N/A\n\n- CVE-2021-26312: Failure to flush the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) of the I/O memory management unit (IOMMU) may lead an IO device to write to memory it should not be able to access, resulting in a potential loss of integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-29509: Puma is a concurrent HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications. The fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris). The fix is very small and a git patch is available for those using unsupported versions of Puma.\n\n- CVE-2021-4001: A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's ebpf verifier between bpf_map_update_elem and bpf_map_freeze due to a missing lock in kernel/bpf/syscall.c. In this flaw, a local user with a special privilege (cap_sys_admin or cap_bpf) can modify the frozen mapped address space. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.16 rc2.\n\n- CVE-2021-41141: PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in the C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In various parts of PJSIP, when error/failure occurs, it is found that the function returns without releasing the currently held locks. This could result in a system deadlock, which cause a denial of service for the users. No release has yet been made which contains the linked fix commit. All versions up to an including 2.11.1 are affected. Users may need to manually apply the patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-4149: A vulnerability was found in btrfs_alloc_tree_b in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c in the Linux kernel due to an improper lock operation in btrfs. In this flaw, a user with a local privilege may cause a denial of service (DOS) due to a deadlock problem.\n\n- CVE-2022-20016: In vow driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking.

This issue is fixed in macOS Monterey 12.5, macOS Big Sur 11.6.8, Security Update 2022-005 Catalina. An app may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.\n\n- CVE-2022-39131: In camera driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local denial of service in kernel.\n\n- CVE-2022-42775: In camera driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local denial of service in kernel.\n\n- CVE-2022-26356: Racy interactions between dirty vram tracking and paging log dirty hypercalls Activation of log dirty mode done by XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram (was named HVMOP_track_dirty_vram before Xen 4.9) is racy with ongoing log dirty hypercalls. A suitably timed call to XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram can enable log dirty while another CPU is still in the process of tearing down the structures related to a previously enabled log dirty mode (XEN_DOMCTL_SHADOW_OP_OFF). This is due to lack of mutually exclusive locking between both operations and can lead to entries being added in already freed slots, resulting in a memory leak.\n\n- CVE-2021-0147: Improper locking in the Power Management Controller (PMC) for some Intel Chipset firmware before versions pmc_fw_lbg_c1-21ww02a and pmc_fw_lbg_b0-21ww02a may allow a privileged user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-39640: In __dwc3_gadget_ep0_queue of ep0.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to improper locking.

This vulnerability is due to a deadlock condition in the code when processing COPS packets under certain conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending COPS packets with high burst rates to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the CPU to consume excessive resources, which prevents other control plane processes from obtaining resources and results in a DoS.\n\n- CVE-2021-20291: A deadlock vulnerability was found in 'github.com/containers/storage' in versions before 1.28.1. When a container image is processed, each layer is unpacked using `tar`. If one of those layers is not a valid `tar` archive this causes an error leading to an unexpected situation where the code indefinitely waits for the tar unpacked stream, which never finishes. An attacker could use this vulnerability to craft a malicious image, which when downloaded and stored by an application using containers/storage, would then cause a deadlock leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n- CVE-2021-28951: An issue was discovered in fs/io_uring.c in the Linux kernel through 5.11.8. It allows attackers to cause a denial of service (deadlock) because exit may be waiting to park a SQPOLL thread, but concurrently that SQPOLL thread is waiting for a signal to start, aka CID-3ebba796fa25.\n\n- CVE-2021-31611: The Bluetooth Classic implementation on Zhuhai Jieli AC690X and AC692X devices does not properly handle an out-of-order LMP Setup procedure that is followed by a malformed LMP packet, allowing attackers in radio range to deadlock a device via a crafted LMP packet. The user needs to manually reboot the device to restore communication.\n\n- CVE-2021-31785: The Bluetooth Classic implementation on Actions ATS2815 and ATS2819 chipsets does not properly handle the reception of multiple LMP_host_connection_req packets, allowing attackers in radio range to trigger a denial of service (deadlock) of the device via crafted LMP packets. Manual user intervention is required to restart the device and restore Bluetooth communication.\n\n- CVE-2021-38203: btrfs in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (deadlock) via processes that trigger allocation of new system chunks during times when there is a shortage of free space in the system space_info.\n\n- CVE-2021-31786: The Bluetooth Classic Audio implementation on Actions ATS2815 and ATS2819 devices does not properly handle a connection attempt from a host with the same BDAddress as the current connected BT host, allowing attackers to trigger a disconnection and deadlock of the device by connecting with a forged BDAddress that matches the original connected host.\n\n- CVE-2021-3499: A vulnerability was found in OVN Kubernetes in versions up to and including 0.3.0 where the Egress Firewall does not reliably apply firewall rules when there is multiple DNS rules. It could lead to potentially lose of confidentiality, integrity or availability of a service.\n\n- CVE-2021-3735: A deadlock issue was found in the AHCI controller device of QEMU. It occurs on a software reset (ahci_reset_port) while handling a host-to-device Register FIS (Frame Information Structure) packet from the guest. A privileged user inside the guest could use this flaw to hang the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-43395: An issue was discovered in illumos before f859e7171bb5db34321e45585839c6c3200ebb90, OmniOS Community Edition r151038, OpenIndiana Hipster 2021.04, and SmartOS 20210923. A local unprivileged user can cause a deadlock and kernel panic via crafted rename and rmdir calls on tmpfs filesystems. Oracle Solaris 10 and 11 is also affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-31621: MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. In extra/mariabackup/ds_xbstream.cc, when an error occurs (stream_ctxt->dest_file == NULL) while executing the method xbstream_open, the held lock is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock. Note: The vendor argues this is just an improper locking bug and not a vulnerability with adverse effects.\n\n- CVE-2022-31622: MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. In extra/mariabackup/ds_compress.cc, when an error occurs (pthread_create returns a nonzero value) while executing the method create_worker_threads, the held lock is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock. Note: The vendor argues this is just an improper locking bug and not a vulnerability with adverse effects.\n\n- CVE-2022-31623: MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. In extra/mariabackup/ds_compress.cc, when an error occurs (i.e., going to the err label) while executing the method create_worker_threads, the held lock thd->ctrl_mutex is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock. Note: The vendor argues this is just an improper locking bug and not a vulnerability with adverse effects.\n\n- CVE-2022-31624: MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. While executing the plugin/server_audit/server_audit.c method log_statement_ex, the held lock lock_bigbuffer is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2022-38791: In MariaDB before 10.9.2, compress_write in extra/mariabackup/ds_compress.cc does not release data_mutex upon a stream write failure, which allows local users to trigger a deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2022-42328: Guests can trigger deadlock in Linux netback driver T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] The patch for XSA-392 introduced another issue which might result in a deadlock when trying to free the SKB of a packet dropped due to the XSA-392 handling (CVE-2022-42328).

          "matched_text": "CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition\n\nType: Base\n\nStatus: Incomplete\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nRace conditions frequently occur in signal handlers, since signal handlers support asynchronous actions. These race conditions have a variety of root causes and symptoms. Attackers may be able to exploit a signal handler race condition to cause the product state to be corrupted, possibly leading to a denial of service or even code execution.\n\n\nThese issues occur when non-reentrant functions, or state-sensitive actions occur in the signal handler, where they may be called at any time. These behaviors can violate assumptions being made by the \"regular\" code that is interrupted, or by other signal handlers that may also be invoked. If these functions are called at an inopportune moment - such as while a non-reentrant function is already running - memory corruption could occur that may be exploitable for code execution. Another signal race condition commonly found occurs when free is called within a signal handler, resulting in a double free and therefore a write-what-where condition. Even if a given pointer is set to NULL after it has been freed, a race condition still exists between the time the memory was freed and the pointer was set to NULL. This is especially problematic if the same signal handler has been set for more than one signal -- since it means that the signal handler itself may be reentered.\n\n\nThere are several known behaviors related to signal handlers that have received the label of \"signal handler race condition\":\n\n\n  - Shared state (e.g. global data or static variables) that are accessible to both a signal handler and \"regular\" code\n\n  - Shared state between a signal handler and other signal handlers\n\n  - Use of non-reentrant functionality within a signal handler - which generally implies that shared state is being used. For example, malloc() and free() are non-reentrant because they may use global or static data structures for managing memory, and they are indirectly used by innocent-seeming functions such as syslog(); these functions could be exploited for memory corruption and, possibly, code execution.\n\n  - Association of the same signal handler function with multiple signals - which might imply shared state, since the same code and resources are accessed. For example, this can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\n  - Use of setjmp and longjmp, or other mechanisms that prevent a signal handler from returning control back to the original functionality\n\n  - While not technically a race condition, some signal handlers are designed to be called at most once, and being called more than once can introduce security problems, even when there are not any concurrent calls to the signal handler. This can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\nSignal handler vulnerabilities are often classified based on the absence of a specific protection mechanism, although this style of classification is discouraged in CWE because programmers often have a choice of several different mechanisms for addressing the weakness. Such protection mechanisms may preserve exclusivity of access to the shared resource, and behavioral atomicity for the relevant code:\n\n  - Avoiding shared state\n\n  - Using synchronization in the signal handler\n\n  - Using synchronization in the regular code\n\n  - Disabling or masking other signals, which provides atomicity (which effectively ensures exclusivity)\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-1999-0035: Signal handler does not disable other signal handlers, allowing it to be interrupted, causing other functionality to access files/etc. with raised privileges\n\n- CVE-2001-0905: Attacker can send a signal while another signal handler is already running, leading to crash or execution with root privileges\n\n- CVE-2001-1349: unsafe calls to library functions from signal handler\n\n- CVE-2004-0794: SIGURG can be used to remotely interrupt signal handler; other variants exist\n\n- CVE-2004-2259: SIGCHLD signal to FTP server can cause crash under heavy load while executing non-reentrant functions like malloc/free.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0244: A signal handler race condition exists in the Layer 2 Address Learning Daemon (L2ALD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS due to the absence of a specific protection mechanism to avoid a race condition which may allow an attacker to bypass the storm-control feature on devices.

Linux and Mac releases of the SDK version 1.14.0 and below contain a key disclosure vulnerability that, in certain conditions, can be exploited by local attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. SDK users of the SqliteAccountInfo format are vulnerable while users of the InMemoryAccountInfo format are safe. The SqliteAccountInfo saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping) in a local database file ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info, ~/.b2_account_info or a user-defined path). When first created, the file is world readable and is (typically a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the user. If the directory containing the file is readable by a local attacker then during the brief period between file creation and permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file and maintain a handle to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents after the file after the sensitive information has been saved to it. Consumers of this SDK who rely on it to save data using SqliteAccountInfo class should upgrade to the latest version of the SDK. Those who believe a local user might have opened a handle using this race condition, should remove the affected database files and regenerate all application keys. Users should upgrade to b2-sdk-python 1.14.1 or later.\n\n- CVE-2022-23653: B2 Command Line Tool is the official command line tool for the backblaze cloud storage service. Linux and Mac releases of the B2 command-line tool version 3.2.0 and below contain a key disclosure vulnerability that, in certain conditions, can be exploited by local attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. The command line tool saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping) in a local database file (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info`, `~/.b2_account_info` or a user-defined path) when `b2 authorize-account` is first run. This happens regardless of whether a valid key is provided or not. When first created, the file is world readable and is (typically a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the user. If the directory is readable by a local attacker and the user did not yet run `b2 authorize-account` then during the brief period between file creation and permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file and maintain a handle to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents after the file after the sensitive information has been saved to it. Users that have not yet run `b2 authorize-account` should upgrade to B2 Command-Line Tool v3.2.1 before running it. Users that have run `b2 authorize-account` are safe if at the time of the file creation no other local users had read access to the local configuration file. Users that have run `b2 authorize-account` where the designated path could be opened by another local user should upgrade to B2 Command-Line Tool v3.2.1 and remove the database and regenerate all application keys. Note that `b2 clear-account` does not remove the database file and it should not be used to ensure that all open handles to the file are invalidated. If B2 Command-Line Tool cannot be upgraded to v3.2.1 due to a dependency conflict, a binary release can be used instead. Alternatively a new version could be installed within a virtualenv, or the permissions can be changed to prevent local users from opening the database file.\n\n- CVE-2022-25165: An issue was discovered in Amazon AWS VPN Client 2.0.0. A TOCTOU race condition exists during the validation of VPN configuration files. This allows parameters outside of the AWS VPN Client allow list to be injected into the configuration file prior to the AWS VPN Client service (running as SYSTEM) processing the file. Dangerous arguments can be injected by a low-level user such as log, which allows an arbitrary destination to be specified for writing log files. This leads to an arbitrary file write as SYSTEM with partial control over the files content. This can be abused to cause an elevation of privilege or denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2022-26859: Dell BIOS contains a race condition vulnerability. A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious input via SMI in order to bypass security checks during SMM.\n\n- CVE-2022-28743: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulerability in Foscam R2C IP camera running System FW <= 1.13.1.6, and Application FW <= 2.91.2.66, allows an authenticated remote attacker with administrator permissions to execute arbitrary remote code via a malicious firmware patch. The impact of this vulnerability is that the remote attacker could gain full remote access to the IP camera and the underlying Linux system with root permissions. With root access to the camera's Linux OS, an attacker could effectively change the code that is running, add backdoor access, or invade the privacy of the user by accessing the live camera stream.\n\n- CVE-2022-29800: A time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition vulnerability was found in networkd-dispatcher. This flaw exists because there is a certain time between the scripts being discovered and them being run. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to replace scripts that networkd-dispatcher believes to be owned by root with ones that are not.\n\n- CVE-2022-31466: Time of Check - Time of Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability in Quick Heal Total Security prior to 12.1.1.27 allows a local attacker to achieve privilege escalation, potentially leading to deletion of system files. This is achieved through exploiting the time between detecting a file as malicious and when the action of quarantining or cleaning is performed, and using the time to replace the malicious file by a symlink.\n\n- CVE-2022-33691: A possible race condition vulnerability in score driver prior to SMR Jul-2022 Release 1 can allow local attackers to interleave malicious operations.\n\n- CVE-2022-34830: An Arm product family through 2022-06-29 has a TOCTOU Race Condition that allows non-privileged user to make improper GPU processing operations to gain access to already freed memory.\n\n- CVE-2022-34899: This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Parallels Access 6.5.4 (39316) Agent. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target host system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the Parallels service. By creating a symbolic link, an attacker can abuse the service to execute a file. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of root.

Race Condition vulnerability in WP ULike Plugin <= 4.6.4 on WordPress allows attackers to increase/decrease rating scores. \n\n- CVE-2022-1537: file.copy operations in GruntJS are vulnerable to a TOCTOU race condition leading to arbitrary file write in GitHub repository gruntjs/grunt prior to 1.5.3. This vulnerability is capable of arbitrary file writes which can lead to local privilege escalation to the GruntJS user if a lower-privileged user has write access to both source and destination directories as the lower-privileged user can create a symlink to the GruntJS user's .bashrc file or replace /etc/shadow file if the GruntJS user is root.\n\n- CVE-2022-21658: Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the `std::fs::remove_dir_all` standard library function is vulnerable a race condition enabling symlink following (CWE-363). An attacker could use this security issue to trick a privileged program into deleting files and directories the attacker couldn't otherwise access or delete. Rust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.58.0 is affected by this vulnerability with 1.58.1 containing a patch. Note that the following build targets don't have usable APIs to properly mitigate the attack, and are thus still vulnerable even with a patched toolchain: macOS before version 10.10 (Yosemite) and REDOX. We recommend everyone to update to Rust 1.58.1 as soon as possible, especially people developing programs expected to run in privileged contexts (including system daemons and setuid binaries), as those have the highest risk of being affected by this. Note that adding checks in your codebase before calling remove_dir_all will not mitigate the vulnerability, as they would also be vulnerable to race conditions like remove_dir_all itself. The existing mitigation is working as intended outside of race conditions.\n\n- CVE-2022-23563: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. In multiple places, TensorFlow uses `tempfile.mktemp` to create temporary files. While this is acceptable in testing, in utilities and libraries it is dangerous as a different process can create the file between the check for the filename in `mktemp` and the actual creation of the file by a subsequent operation (a TOC/TOU type of weakness). In several instances, TensorFlow was supposed to actually create a temporary directory instead of a file. This logic bug is hidden away by the `mktemp` function usage. We have patched the issue in several commits, replacing `mktemp` with the safer `mkstemp`/`mkdtemp` functions, according to the usage pattern. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-4098: Insufficient data validation in Mojo in Google Chrome prior to 96.0.4664.110 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to potentially perform a sandbox escape via a crafted HTML page.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-362 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-362 (ChildOf)",

When a signal handler uses global or static variables, or invokes functions that ultimately depend on such state or its associated metadata, then it could corrupt system state that is being used by normal functionality. This could subject the program to race conditions or other weaknesses that allow an attacker to cause the program state to be corrupted. While denial of service is frequently the consequence, in some cases this weakness could be leveraged for code execution.\n\n\nThere are several different scenarios that introduce this issue:\n\n\n  - Invocation of non-reentrant functions from within the handler. One example is malloc(), which modifies internal global variables as it manages memory. Very few functions are actually reentrant.\n\n  - Code sequences (not necessarily function calls) contain non-atomic use of global variables, or associated metadata or structures, that can be accessed by other functionality of the program, including other signal handlers. Frequently, the same function is registered to handle multiple signals.\n\n  - The signal handler function is intended to run at most one time, but instead it can be invoked multiple times. This could happen by repeated delivery of the same signal, or by delivery of different signals that have the same handler function (CWE-831).\n\nNote that in some environments or contexts, it might be possible for the signal handler to be interrupted itself.\n\nIf both a signal handler and the normal behavior of the product have to operate on the same set of state variables, and a signal is received in the middle of the normal execution's modifications of those variables, the variables may be in an incorrect or corrupt state during signal handler execution, and possibly still incorrect or corrupt upon return.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2008-4109: Signal handler uses functions that ultimately call the unsafe syslog/malloc/s*printf, leading to denial of service via multiple login attempts\n\n- CVE-2006-5051: Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n\n- CVE-2001-1349: unsafe calls to library functions from signal handler\n\n- CVE-2004-0794: SIGURG can be used to remotely interrupt signal handler; other variants exist.\n\n- CVE-2004-2259: SIGCHLD signal to FTP server can cause crash under heavy load while executing non-reentrant functions like malloc/free.\n\n- CVE-2002-1563: SIGCHLD not blocked in a daemon loop while counter is modified, causing counter to get out of sync.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-364 (ChildOf)",

A threat actor can obtain sensitive user data by decoding the tokens as JWT is signed and encoded, not encrypted.\n\n- CVE-2021-34421: The Keybase Client for Android before version 5.8.0 and the Keybase Client for iOS before version 5.8.0 fails to properly remove exploded messages initiated by a user if the receiving user places the chat session in the background while the sending user explodes the messages. This could lead to disclosure of sensitive information which was meant to be deleted from the customer's device.\n\n- CVE-2021-39327: The BulletProof Security WordPress plugin is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure due to a file path disclosure in the publicly accessible ~/db_backup_log.txt file which grants attackers the full path of the site, in addition to the path of database backup files. This affects versions up to, and including, 5.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-45330: An issue exsits in Gitea through 1.15.7, which could let a malicious user gain privileges due to client side cookies not being deleted and the session remains valid on the server side for reuse.\n\n- CVE-2021-4147: A flaw was found in the libvirt libxl driver.

In the case where an interrupt is not quiescent yet at the time this cleanup gets invoked, the cleanup attempt may be scheduled to be retried. When multiple interrupts are involved, this scheduling of a retry may get erroneously skipped. At the same time pointers may get cleared (resulting in a de-reference of NULL) and freed (resulting in a use-after-free), while other code would continue to assume them to be valid.\n\n- CVE-2022-1473: The OPENSSL_LH_flush() function, which empties a hash table, contains a bug that breaks reuse of the memory occuppied by the removed hash table entries. This function is used when decoding certificates or keys. If a long lived process periodically decodes certificates or keys its memory usage will expand without bounds and the process might be terminated by the operating system causing a denial of service. Also traversing the empty hash table entries will take increasingly more time. Typically such long lived processes might be TLS clients or TLS servers configured to accept client certificate authentication. The function was added in the OpenSSL 3.0 version thus older releases are not affected by the issue.

The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, get de-allocated when a guest switched (back) from v2 to v1. The freeing of such pages requires that the hypervisor know where in the guest these pages were mapped. The hypervisor tracks only one use within guest space, but racing requests from the guest to insert mappings of these pages may result in any of them to become mapped in multiple locations. Upon switching back from v2 to v1, the guest would then retain access to a page that was freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes.\n\n- CVE-2021-28701: Another race in XENMAPSPACE_grant_table handling Guests are permitted access to certain Xen-owned pages of memory. The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, are de-allocated when a guest switches (back) from v2 to v1. Freeing such pages requires that the hypervisor enforce that no parallel request can result in the addition of a mapping of such a page to a guest. That enforcement was missing, allowing guests to retain access to pages that were freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes. Unfortunately, when XSA-379 was being prepared, this similar issue was not noticed.\n\n- CVE-2020-11492: An issue was discovered in Docker Desktop through 2.2.0.5 on Windows.

This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j.

It allows an attacker to cause Denial of Service.\n\n- CVE-2021-37639: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. When restoring tensors via raw APIs, if the tensor name is not provided, TensorFlow can be tricked into dereferencing a null pointer. Alternatively, attackers can read memory outside the bounds of heap allocated data by providing some tensor names but not enough for a successful restoration. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/47a06f40411a69c99f381495f490536972152ac0/tensorflow/core/kernels/save_restore_tensor.cc#L158-L159) retrieves the tensor list corresponding to the `tensor_name` user controlled input and immediately retrieves the tensor at the restoration index (controlled via `preferred_shard` argument). This occurs without validating that the provided list has enough values. If the list is empty this results in dereferencing a null pointer (undefined behavior). If, however, the list has some elements, if the restoration index is outside the bounds this results in heap OOB read. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 9e82dce6e6bd1f36a57e08fa85af213e2b2f2622. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0.

Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-25926: Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.\n\n- CVE-2021-25963: Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\n\n- CVE-2021-1879: Universal XSS in mobile operating system, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-3580: Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in firewall product leads to XSS (CWE-79), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2014-8958: Admin GUI allows XSS through cookie.\n\n- CVE-2017-9764: Web stats program allows XSS through crafted HTTP header.\n\n- CVE-2014-5198: Web log analysis product allows XSS through crafted HTTP Referer header.\n\n- CVE-2008-5080: Chain: protection mechanism failure allows XSS\n\n- CVE-2006-4308: Chain: incomplete denylist (CWE-184) only checks \"javascript:\" tag, allowing XSS (CWE-79) using other tags\n\n- CVE-2007-5727: Chain: incomplete denylist (CWE-184) only removes SCRIPT tags, enabling XSS (CWE-79)\n\n- CVE-2008-5770: Reflected XSS using the PATH_INFO in a URL\n\n- CVE-2008-4730: Reflected XSS not properly handled when generating an error message\n\n- CVE-2008-5734: Reflected XSS sent through email message.\n\n- CVE-2008-0971: Stored XSS in a security product.\n\n- CVE-2008-5249: Stored XSS using a wiki page.\n\n- CVE-2006-3568: Stored XSS in a guestbook application.\n\n- CVE-2006-3211: Stored XSS in a guestbook application using a javascript: URI in a bbcode img tag.\n\n- CVE-2006-3295: Chain: library file is not protected against a direct request (CWE-425), leading to reflected XSS (CWE-79).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-7050: Codologic Codoforum through 4.8.4 allows a DOM-based XSS. While creating a new topic as a normal user, it is possible to add a poll that is automatically loaded in the DOM once the thread/topic is opened. Because session cookies lack the HttpOnly flag, it is possible to steal authentication cookies and take over accounts.\n\n- CVE-2020-7051: Codologic Codoforum through 4.8.4 allows stored XSS in the login area. This is relevant in conjunction with CVE-2020-5842 because session cookies lack the HttpOnly flag. The impact is account takeover.\n\n- CVE-2021-1543: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an attacker to do the following: Hijack a user session Execute arbitrary commands as a root user on the underlying operating system Conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack Conduct an HTML injection attack For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-21260: Online Invoicing System (OIS) is open source software which is a lean invoicing system for small businesses, consultants and freelancers created using AppGini. In OIS version 4.0 there is a stored XSS which can enables an attacker takeover of the admin account through a payload that extracts a csrf token and sends a request to change password. It has been found that Item description is reflected without sanitization in app/items_view.php which enables the malicious scenario.\n\n- CVE-2021-21283: Flarum is an open source discussion platform for websites. The \"Flarum Sticky\" extension versions 0.1.0-beta.14 and 0.1.0-beta.15 has a cross-site scripting vulnerability. A change in release beta 14 of the Sticky extension caused the plain text content of the first post of a pinned discussion to be injected as HTML on the discussion list. The issue was discovered following an internal audit. Any HTML would be injected through the m.trust() helper. This resulted in an HTML injection where <script> tags would not be executed. However it was possible to run javascript from other HTML attributes, enabling a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack to be performed. Since the exploit only happens with the first post of a pinned discussion, an attacker would need the ability to pin their own discussion, or be able to edit a discussion that was previously pinned. On forums where all pinned posts are authored by your staff, you can be relatively certain the vulnerability has not been exploited. Forums where some user-created discussions were pinned can look at the first post edit date to find whether the vulnerability might have been exploited. Because Flarum doesn't store the post content history, you cannot be certain if a malicious edit was reverted. The fix will be available in version v0.1.0-beta.16 with Flarum beta 16. The fix has already been back-ported to Flarum beta 15 as version v0.1.0-beta.15.1 of the Sticky extension. Forum administrators can disable the Sticky extension until they are able to apply the update. The vulnerability cannot be exploited while the extension is disabled.\n\n- CVE-2021-21332: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.27.0, the password reset endpoint served via Synapse was vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The impact depends on the configuration of the domain that Synapse is deployed on, but may allow access to cookies and other browser data, CSRF vulnerabilities, and access to other resources served on the same domain or parent domains. This is fixed in version 1.27.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-22223: Client-Side code injection through Feature Flag name in GitLab CE/EE starting with 11.9 allows a specially crafted feature flag name to PUT requests on behalf of other users via clicking on a link\n\n- CVE-2021-22722: A CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Stored Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could cause code injection when importing a CSV file or changing station parameters.\n\n- CVE-2021-22723: A CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-siteScripting) through Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could allow an attacker to impersonate the user who manages the charging station or carry out actions on their behalf when crafted malicious parameters are submitted to the charging station web server.\n\n- CVE-2021-24301: The Hotjar Connecticator WordPress plugin through 1.1.1 is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the 'hotjar script' textarea. The request did include a CSRF nonce that was properly verified by the server and this vulnerability could only be exploited by administrator users.\n\n- CVE-2021-24891: The Elementor Website Builder WordPress plugin before 3.4.8 does not sanitise or escape user input appended to the DOM via a malicious hash, resulting in a DOM Cross-Site Scripting issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-25955: In \u201cDolibarr ERP CRM\u201d, WYSIWYG Editor module, v2.8.1 to v13.0.2 are affected by a stored XSS vulnerability that allows low privileged application users to store malicious scripts in the \u201cPrivate Note\u201d field at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint. These scripts are executed in a victim\u2019s browser when they open the page containing the vulnerable field. In the worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged administrator. The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account takeover of the admin and due to other vulnerability (Improper Access Control on Private notes) a low privileged user can update the private notes which could lead to privilege escalation.\n\n- CVE-2021-26929: An XSS issue was discovered in Horde Groupware Webmail Edition through 5.2.22 (where the Horde_Text_Filter library before 2.3.7 is used). The attacker can send a plain text e-mail message, with JavaScript encoded as a link or email that is mishandled by preProcess in Text2html.php, because bespoke use of \\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00 and \\\\x01\\\\x01\\\\x01 interferes with XSS defenses.\n\n- CVE-2021-29208: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29209: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29210: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29459: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. It is possible to persistently inject scripts in XWiki versions prior to 12.6.3 and 12.8. Unregistred users can fill simple text fields. Registered users can fill in their personal information and (if they have edit rights) fill the values of static lists using App Within Minutes. There is no easy workaround except upgrading XWiki. The vulnerability has been patched on XWiki 12.8 and 12.6.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32772: Poddycast is a podcast app made with Electron. Prior to version 0.8.1, an attacker can create a podcast or episode with malicious characters and execute commands on the client machine. The application does not clean the HTML characters of the podcast information obtained from the Feed, which allows the injection of HTML and JS code (cross-site scripting). Being an application made in electron, cross-site scripting can be scaled to remote code execution, making it possible to execute commands on the machine where the application is running. The vulnerability is patched in Poddycast version 0.8.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-34656: The 2Way VideoCalls and Random Chat - HTML5 Webcam Videochat WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the `vws_notice` function found in the ~/inc/requirements.php file which allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 5.2.7.\n\n- CVE-2021-34763: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an attacker to execute a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or an open redirect attack. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-34821: Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in AAT Novus Management System through 1.51.2. The WebUI has wrong HTTP 404 error handling implemented. A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to exploit the issue by sending malicious HTTP requests to non-existing URIs. The value of the URL path filename is copied into the HTML document as plain text tags.\n\n- CVE-2021-3529: A flaw was found in noobaa-core in versions before 5.7.0. This flaw results in the name of an arbitrarily URL being copied into an HTML document as plain text between tags, including potentially a payload script. The input was echoed unmodified in the application response, resulting in arbitrary JavaScript being injected into an application's response. The highest threat to the system is for confidentiality, availability, and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-39186: GlobalNewFiles is a MediaWiki extension maintained by Miraheze. Prior to commit number cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d, the username column of the GlobalNewFiles special page is vulnerable to a stored XSS. Commit number cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d contains a patch. As a workaround, one may disallow <,> (or other characters required to insert html/js) from being used in account names so an XSS is not possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-37541: In JetBrains Hub before 2021.1.13402, HTML injection in the password reset email was possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-34419: In the Zoom Client for Meetings for Ubuntu Linux before version 5.1.0, there is an HTML injection flaw when sending a remote control request to a user in the process of in-meeting screen sharing.

An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML in \"/restful-services/2.0/analyticalDrivers\" via the 'LABEL' and 'NAME' parameters.\n\n- CVE-2021-22232: HTML injection was possible via the full name field before versions 13.11.6, 13.12.6, and 14.0.2 in GitLab CE\n\n- CVE-2020-23050: TAO Open Source Assessment Platform v3.3.0 RC02 was discovered to contain a HTML injection vulnerability in the userFirstName parameter of the user account input field. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute phishing attacks, external redirects, and arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-39348: The LearnPress WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient escaping on the $custom_profile parameter found in the ~/inc/admin/views/backend-user-profile.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 4.1.3.1. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled. Please note that this is seperate from CVE-2021-24702.\n\n- CVE-2021-21333: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.27.0, the notification emails sent for notifications for missed messages or for an expiring account are subject to HTML injection. In the case of the notification for missed messages, this could allow an attacker to insert forged content into the email. The account expiry feature is not enabled by default and the HTML injection is not controllable by an attacker. This is fixed in version 1.27.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-42663: An HTML injection vulnerability exists in Sourcecodester Online Event Booking and Reservation System in PHP/MySQL via the msg parameter to /event-management/index.php. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability in order to change the visibility of the website. Once the target user clicks on a given link he will display the content of the HTML code of the attacker's choice.\n\n- CVE-2021-41248: GraphiQL is the reference implementation of this monorepo, GraphQL IDE, an official project under the GraphQL Foundation. All versions of graphiql older than graphiql@1.4.7 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a vulnerable schema in graphiql. There are a number of ways that can occur. By default, the schema URL is not attacker-controllable in graphiql or in its suggested implementations or examples, leaving only very complex attack vectors. If a custom implementation of graphiql's fetcher allows the schema URL to be set dynamically, such as a URL query parameter like ?endpoint= in graphql-playground, or a database provided value, then this custom graphiql implementation is vulnerable to phishing attacks, and thus much more readily available, low or no privelege level xss attacks. The URLs could look like any generic looking graphql schema URL. It should be noted that desktop clients such as Altair, Insomnia, Postwoman, do not appear to be impacted by this. This vulnerability does not impact codemirror-graphql, monaco-graphql or other dependents, as it exists in onHasCompletion.ts in graphiql. It does impact all forks of graphiql, and every released version of graphiql.\n\n- CVE-2021-41249: GraphQL Playground is a GraphQL IDE for development of graphQL focused applications. All versions of graphql-playground-react older than graphql-playground-react@1.7.28 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a malicious schema in graphql-playground. There are several ways this can occur, including by specifying the URL to a malicious schema in the endpoint query parameter. If a user clicks on a link to a GraphQL Playground installation that specifies a malicious server, arbitrary JavaScript can run in the user's browser, which can be used to exfiltrate user credentials or other harmful goals. If you are using graphql-playground-react directly in your client app, upgrade to version 1.7.28 or later.\n\n- CVE-2021-41825: Verint Workforce Optimization (WFO) 15.2.5.1033 allows HTML injection via the /wfo/control/signin username parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-42564: An open redirect through HTML injection in confidential messages in Cryptshare before 5.1.0 allows remote attackers (with permission to provide confidential messages via Cryptshare) to redirect targeted victims to any URL via the '<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\"' substring in the editor parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-43683: pictshare v1.5 is affected by a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in api/info.php. The exit function will terminate the script and print the message which has $_REQUEST['hash'].\n\n- CVE-2021-31682: The login portal for the Automated Logic WebCTRL/WebCTRL OEM web application contains a vulnerability that allows for reflected XSS attacks due to the operatorlocale GET parameter not being sanitized. This issue impacts versions 6.5 and below. This issue works by passing in a basic XSS payload to a vulnerable GET parameter that is reflected in the output without sanitization.\n\n- CVE-2021-21313: GLPI is open source software which stands for Gestionnaire Libre de Parc Informatique and it is a Free Asset and IT Management Software package. In GLPI before verison 9.5.4, there is a vulnerability in the /ajax/common.tabs.php endpoint, indeed, at least two parameters _target and id are not properly sanitized.

When uploading file in a specific menu, the verification of the files is insufficient. It allows remote attackers to upload arbitrary files disguising them as image files.\n\n- CVE-2021-32478: The redirect URI in the LTI authorization endpoint required extra sanitizing to prevent reflected XSS and open redirect risks. Moodle versions 3.10 to 3.10.3, 3.9 to 3.9.6, 3.8 to 3.8.8 and earlier unsupported versions are affected.\n\n- CVE-2021-35229: Cross-site scripting vulnerability is present in Database Performance Monitor 2022.1.7779 and previous versions when using a complex SQL query\n\n- CVE-2021-36760: In accountrecoveryendpoint/recoverpassword.do in WSO2 Identity Server 5.7.0, it is possible to perform a DOM-Based XSS attack affecting the callback parameter modifying the URL that precedes the callback parameter. Once the username or password reset procedure is completed, the JavaScript code will be executed. (recoverpassword.do also has an open redirect issue for a similar reason.)\n\n- CVE-2021-38952: IBM InfoSphere Information Server 11.7 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This vulnerability allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI thus altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session. IBM X-Force ID: 211408.\n\n- CVE-2021-39910: An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 12.6 before 14.3.6, all versions starting from 14.4 before 14.4.4, all versions starting from 14.5 before 14.5.2. GitLab was vulnerable to HTML Injection through the Swagger UI feature.\n\n- CVE-2021-41948: A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the \"contact us\" plugin for Subrion CMS <= 4.2.1 version via \"List of subjects\".\n\n- CVE-2021-42136: A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Missing Data Codes functionality of REDCap before 11.4.0 allows remote attackers to execute JavaScript code in the client's browser by storing said code as a Missing Data Code value. This can then be leveraged to execute a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack to escalate privileges to administrator.\n\n- CVE-2021-43862: jQuery Terminal Emulator is a plugin for creating command line interpreters in your applications. Versions prior to 2.31.1 contain a low impact and limited cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The code for XSS payload is always visible, but an attacker can use other techniques to hide the code the victim sees. If the application uses the `execHash` option and executes code from URL, the attacker can use this URL to execute their code. The scope is limited because the javascript attribute used is added to span tag, so no automatic execution like with `onerror` on images is possible. This issue is fixed in version 2.31.1. As a workaround, the user can use formatting that wrap whole user input and its no op. The code for this workaround is available in the GitHub Security Advisory. The fix will only work when user of the library is not using different formatters (e.g. to highlight code in different way).\n\n- CVE-2021-43961: Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager 3.36.0 allows HTML Injection.\n\n- CVE-2021-44082: textpattern 4.8.7 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) via /textpattern/index.php,Body. A remote and unauthenticated attacker can use XSS to trigger remote code execution by uploading a webshell.

Argo CD starting with 2.3.0 and prior to 2.3.6 and 2.4.5 is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript in the `/auth/callback` page in a victim's browser. This vulnerability only affects Argo CD instances which have single sign on (SSO) enabled. The exploit also assumes the attacker has 1) access to the API server's encryption key, 2) a method to add a cookie to the victim's browser, and 3) the ability to convince the victim to visit a malicious `/auth/callback` link. The vulnerability is classified as low severity because access to the API server's encryption key already grants a high level of access. Exploiting the XSS would allow the attacker to impersonate the victim, but would not grant any privileges which the attacker could not otherwise gain using the encryption key. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions 2.4.5 and 2.3.6. There is currently no known workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-3242: Code Injection in GitHub repository microweber/microweber prior to 1.3.2.\n\n- CVE-2022-32763: A cross-site scripting (xss) sanitization vulnerability bypass exists in the SanitizeHtml functionality of Lansweeper lansweeper 10.1.1.0.

The victim's encrypted password can be stolen and most likely be decrypted.\n\n- CVE-2022-45004: Gophish through 0.12.1 was discovered to contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via a crafted landing page.\n\n- CVE-2022-45411: Cross-Site Tracing occurs when a server will echo a request back via the Trace method, allowing an XSS attack to access to authorization headers and cookies inaccessible to JavaScript (such as cookies protected by HTTPOnly). To mitigate this attack, browsers placed limits on <code>fetch()</code> and XMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have implemented non-standard headers such as <code>X-Http-Method-Override</code> that override the HTTP method, and made this attack possible again. Thunderbird has applied the same mitigations to the use of this and similar headers. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.\n\n- CVE-2022-39207: Onedev is an open source, self-hosted Git Server with CI/CD and Kanban. During CI/CD builds, it is possible to save build artifacts for later retrieval. They can be accessed through OneDev's web UI after the successful run of a build. These artifact files are served by the webserver in the same context as the UI without any further restrictions. This leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when a user creates a build artifact that contains HTML. When accessing the artifact, the content is rendered by the browser, including any JavaScript that it contains. Since all cookies (except for the rememberMe one) do not set the HttpOnly flag, an attacker could steal the session of a victim and use it to impersonate them. To exploit this issue, attackers need to be able to modify the content of artifacts, which usually means they need to be able to modify a project's build spec. The exploitation requires the victim to click on an attacker's link. It can be used to elevate privileges by targeting admins of a OneDev instance. In the worst case, this can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, because admins can create Server Shell Executors and use them to run any command on the server. This issue has been patched in version 7.3.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-3033: If a Thunderbird user replied to a crafted HTML email containing a <code>meta</code> tag, with the <code>meta</code> tag having the <code>http-equiv=\"refresh\"</code> attribute, and the content attribute specifying an URL, then Thunderbird started a network request to that URL, regardless of the configuration to block remote content. In combination with certain other HTML elements and attributes in the email, it was possible to execute JavaScript code included in the message in the context of the message compose document. The JavaScript code was able to perform actions including, but probably not limited to, read and modify the contents of the message compose document, including the quoted original message, which could potentially contain the decrypted plaintext of encrypted data in the crafted email. The contents could then be transmitted to the network, either to the URL specified in the META refresh tag, or to a different URL, as the JavaScript code could modify the URL specified in the document. This bug doesn't affect users who have changed the default Message Body display setting to 'simple html' or 'plain text'. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.2.1 and Thunderbird < 91.13.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-29444: Plugin Settings Change leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Cloudways Breeze plugin <= 2.0.2 on WordPress allows users with a subscriber or higher user role to execute any of the wp_ajax_* actions in the class Breeze_Configuration which includes the ability to change any of the plugin's settings including CDN setting which could be further used for XSS attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-36176: Multiple uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerabilities in the web interface of FortiPortal before 6.0.6 may allow a single low-privileged user to induce a denial of service via multiple HTTP requests.\n\n- CVE-2021-43929: Improper neutralization of special elements in output used by a downstream component ('Injection') vulnerability in work flow management in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 7.0.1-42218-2 allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2022-2178: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Saysis Computer Starcities allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).This issue affects Starcities: before 1.1. \n\n- CVE-2022-38628: Nortek Linear eMerge E3-Series 0.32-08f, 0.32-07p, 0.32-07e, 0.32-09c, 0.32-09b, 0.32-09a, and 0.32-08e were discovered to contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability which is chained with a local session fixation.

An attacker is able to inject arbitrary `CSS` into the generated graph allowing them to change the styling of elements outside of the generated graph, and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information by using specially crafted `CSS` selectors. The following example shows how an attacker can exfiltrate the contents of an input field by bruteforcing the `value` attribute one character at a time. Whenever there is an actual match, an `http` request will be made by the browser in order to \"load\" a background image that will let an attacker know what's the value of the character. This issue may lead to `Information Disclosure` via CSS selectors and functions able to generate HTTP requests. This also allows an attacker to change the document in ways which may lead a user to perform unintended actions, such as clicking on a link, etc. This issue has been resolved in version 9.1.3.

In affected versions due to incomplete validation in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeV2`, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/84d053187cb80d975ef2b9684d4b61981bca0c41/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_op.cc#L59) has some validation but does not check that `min_range` and `max_range` both have the same non-zero number of elements. If `axis` is provided (i.e., not `-1`), then validation should check that it is a value in range for the rank of `input` tensor and then the lengths of `min_range` and `max_range` inputs match the `axis` dimension of the `input` tensor. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 6da6620efad397c85493b8f8667b821403516708. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-37665: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions due to incomplete validation in MKL implementation of requantization, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/mkl/mkl_requantization_range_per_channel_op.cc) does not validate the dimensions of the `input` tensor. A similar issue occurs in `MklRequantizePerChannelOp`. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/mkl/mkl_requantize_per_channel_op.cc) does not perform full validation for all the input arguments.

Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-25727: Memory Corruption in modem due to improper length check while copying into memory in Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Voice & Music\n\n- CVE-2022-25793: A Stack-based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in Autodesk 3ds Max 2022, 2021, and 2020 may lead to code execution through the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer when parsing ActionScript Byte Code files.

Azure RTOS USBX implementation of host support for USB CDC ECM includes an integer underflow and a buffer overflow in the `_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function which may be potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution or denial of service. Setting mac address string descriptor length to a `0` or `1` allows an attacker to introduce an integer underflow followed (string_length) by a buffer overflow of the `cdc_ecm -> ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id` array. This may allow one to redirect the code execution flow or introduce a denial of service. The fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel). Improved mac address string descriptor length validation to check for unexpectedly small values may be used as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-36620: D-link DIR-816 A2_v1.10CNB04, DIR-878 DIR_878_FW1.30B08.img is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via /goform/addRouting.\n\n- CVE-2022-37134: D-link DIR-816 A2_v1.10CNB04.img is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via /goform/form2Wan.cgi.

Prior to version 0.10.2, the heap initialization methods were missing a minimum size check for the given heap size argument. This could lead to out-of-bound writes when a heap was initialized with a size smaller than `3 * size_of::<usize>` because of metadata write operations. This vulnerability impacts all the initialization functions on the `Heap` and `LockedHeap` types, including `Heap::new`, `Heap::init`, `Heap::init_from_slice`, and `LockedHeap::new`. It also affects multiple uses of the `Heap::extend` method. Version 0.10.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, ensure that the heap is only initialized with a size larger than `3 * size_of::<usize>` and that the `Heap::extend` method is only called with sizes larger than `2 * size_of::<usize>()`. Also, ensure that the total heap size is (and stays) a multiple of `2 * size_of::<usize>()`.\n\n- CVE-2022-36938: DexLoader function get_stringidx_fromdex() in Redex prior to commit 3b44c64 can load an out of bound address when loading the string index table, potentially allowing remote code execution during processing of a 3rd party Android APK file.\n\n- CVE-2021-1058: NVIDIA vGPU software contains a vulnerability in the guest kernel mode driver and vGPU plugin, in which an input data size is not validated, which may lead to tampering of data or denial of service.

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 39ec7eaf1428e90c37787e5b3fbd68ebd3c48860. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-48297: The geofencing kernel code has a vulnerability of not verifying the length of the input data. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause out-of-bounds memory access.\n\n- CVE-2022-48298: The geofencing kernel code does not verify the length of the input data. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause out-of-bounds memory access.\n\n- CVE-2021-0934: In findAllDeAccounts of AccountsDb.java, there is a possible denial of service due to resource exhaustion. This could lead to local denial of service with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-12 Android-12L Android-13Android ID: A-169762606\n\n- CVE-2021-28510: For certain systems running EOS, a Precision Time Protocol (PTP) packet of a management/signaling message with an invalid Type-Length-Value (TLV) causes the PTP agent to restart. Repeated restarts of the service will make the service unavailable.\n\n- CVE-2022-0214: The Custom Popup Builder WordPress plugin before 1.3.1 autoload data from its popup on every pages, as such data can be sent by unauthenticated user, and is not validated in length, this could cause a denial of service on the blog\n\n- CVE-2022-1174: A potential DoS vulnerability was discovered in Gitlab CE/EE versions 13.7 before 14.7.7, all versions starting from 14.8 before 14.8.5, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.2 allowed an attacker to trigger high CPU usage via a special crafted input added in Issues, Merge requests, Milestones, Snippets, Wiki pages, etc.\n\n- CVE-2022-23319: A segmentation fault during PCF file parsing in pcf2bdf versions >=1.05 allows an attacker to trigger a program crash via a specially crafted PCF font file. This crash affects the availability of the software and dependent downstream components.\n\n- CVE-2022-23580: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. During shape inference, TensorFlow can allocate a large vector based on a value from a tensor controlled by the user. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-29202: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.ragged.constant` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a denial of service by consuming all available memory. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36078: Binary provides encoding/decoding in Borsh and other formats. The vulnerability is a memory allocation vulnerability that can be exploited to allocate slices in memory with (arbitrary) excessive size value, which can either exhaust available memory or crash the whole program. When using `github.com/gagliardetto/binary` to parse unchecked (or wrong type of) data from untrusted sources of input (e.g. the blockchain) into slices, it's possible to allocate memory with excessive size. When `dec.Decode(&val)` method is used to parse data into a structure that is or contains slices of values, the length of the slice was previously read directly from the data itself without any checks on the size of it, and then a slice was allocated. This could lead to an overflow and an allocation of memory with excessive size value. Users should upgrade to `v0.7.1` or higher. A workaround is not to rely on the `dec.Decode(&val)` function to parse the data, but to use a custom `UnmarshalWithDecoder()` method that reads and checks the length of any slice.\n\n- CVE-2022-37311: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large location request parameter to the redirect servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-37312: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large request body containing a redirect URL to the deferrer servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-39294: conduit-hyper integrates a conduit application with the hyper server. Prior to version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` did not check any limit on a request's length before calling [`hyper::body::to_bytes`](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/body/fn.to_bytes.html). An attacker could send a malicious request with an abnormally large `Content-Length`, which could lead to a panic if memory allocation failed for that request. In version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` sets an internal limit of 128 MiB per request, otherwise returning status 400 (\"Bad Request\"). This crate is part of the implementation of Rust's [crates.io](https://crates.io/), but that service is not affected due to its existing cloud infrastructure, which already drops such malicious requests. Even with the new limit in place, `conduit-hyper` is not recommended for production use, nor to directly serve the public Internet.\n\n- CVE-2022-4111: Unrestricted file size limit can lead to DoS in tooljet/tooljet <1.27 by allowing a logged in attacker to upload profile pictures over 2MB. \n\n- CVE-2022-41968: Nextcloud Server is an open source personal cloud server. Prior to versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.5, calendar name lengths are not validated before writing to a database. As a result, an attacker can send unnecessary amounts of data against the database. Version 23.0.10 and 24.0.5 contain patches for the issue. No known workarounds are available.\n\n- CVE-2022-20488: In NotificationChannel of NotificationChannel.java, there is a possible failure to persist permissions settings due to resource exhaustion. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-12 Android-12L Android-13Android ID: A-242703217\n\n- CVE-2022-20491: In NotificationChannel of NotificationChannel.java, there is a possible failure to persist permissions settings due to resource exhaustion. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-12 Android-12L Android-13Android ID: A-242703556\n\n- CVE-2022-20691: A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol functionality of Cisco ATA 190 Series Adaptive Telephone Adapter firmware could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a DoS condition of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to missing length validation of certain Cisco Discovery Protocol packet header fields. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to exhaust available memory and cause the service to restart. Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability. \n\n- CVE-2022-21208: The package node-opcua before 2.74.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to a missing limitation on the number of received chunks - per single session or in total for all concurrent sessions. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending an unlimited number of huge chunks (e.g. 2GB each) without sending the Final closing chunk.\n\n- CVE-2022-29212: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, certain TFLite models that were created using TFLite model converter would crash when loaded in the TFLite interpreter. The culprit is that during quantization the scale of values could be greater than 1 but code was always assuming sub-unit scaling. Thus, since code was calling `QuantizeMultiplierSmallerThanOneExp`, the `TFLITE_CHECK_LT` assertion would trigger and abort the process. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29196: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackpropFilterV2` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate that the `filter_sizes` argument is a vector. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29200: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.LSTMBlockCell` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate the ranks of any of the arguments to this API call. This results in `CHECK`-failures when the elements of the tensor are accessed. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-789 (CanPrecede)",

This is accomplished by extracting package contents into a project's `node_modules` folder. If the `node_modules` folder of the root project or any of its dependencies is somehow replaced with a symbolic link, it could allow Arborist to write package dependencies to any arbitrary location on the file system. Note that symbolic links contained within package artifact contents are filtered out, so another means of creating a `node_modules` symbolic link would have to be employed. 1. A `preinstall` script could replace `node_modules` with a symlink. (This is prevented by using `--ignore-scripts`.) 2. An attacker could supply the target with a git repository, instructing them to run `npm install --ignore-scripts` in the root. This may be successful, because `npm install --ignore-scripts` is typically not capable of making changes outside of the project directory, so it may be deemed safe. This is patched in @npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above. For more information including workarounds please see the referenced GHSA-gmw6-94gg-2rc2.\n\n- CVE-2021-1612: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software CLI could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the local system. This vulnerability is due to improper access controls on files within the local file system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a symbolic link in a specific location on the local file system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on an affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-26089: An improper symlink following in FortiClient for Mac 6.4.3 and below may allow an non-privileged user to execute arbitrary privileged shell commands during installation phase.\n\n- CVE-2022-20720: Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOx application hosting environment on multiple Cisco platforms could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying host operating system, execute arbitrary code on the underlying host operating system, install applications without being authenticated, or conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the affected software. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2022-26612: In Apache Hadoop, The unTar function uses unTarUsingJava function on Windows and the built-in tar utility on Unix and other OSes. As a result, a TAR entry may create a symlink under the expected extraction directory which points to an external directory. A subsequent TAR entry may extract an arbitrary file into the external directory using the symlink name. This however would be caught by the same targetDirPath check on Unix because of the getCanonicalPath call. However on Windows, getCanonicalPath doesn't resolve symbolic links, which bypasses the check. unpackEntries during TAR extraction follows symbolic links which allows writing outside expected base directory on Windows. This was addressed in Apache Hadoop 3.2.3\n\n- CVE-2022-3592: A symlink following vulnerability was found in Samba, where a user can create a symbolic link that will make 'smbd' escape the configured share path. This flaw allows a remote user with access to the exported part of the file system under a share via SMB1 unix extensions or NFS to create symlinks to files outside the 'smbd' configured share path and gain access to another restricted server's filesystem.\n\n- CVE-2022-36113: Cargo is a package manager for the rust programming language. After a package is downloaded, Cargo extracts its source code in the ~/.cargo folder on disk, making it available to the Rust projects it builds. To record when an extraction is successful, Cargo writes \"ok\" to the .cargo-ok file at the root of the extracted source code once it extracted all the files. It was discovered that Cargo allowed packages to contain a .cargo-ok symbolic link, which Cargo would extract. Then, when Cargo attempted to write \"ok\" into .cargo-ok, it would actually replace the first two bytes of the file the symlink pointed to with ok. This would allow an attacker to corrupt one file on the machine using Cargo to extract the package. Note that by design Cargo allows code execution at build time, due to build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerabilities in this advisory allow performing a subset of the possible damage in a harder to track down way. Your dependencies must still be trusted if you want to be protected from attacks, as it's possible to perform the same attacks with build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerability is present in all versions of Cargo. Rust 1.64, to be released on September 22nd, will include a fix for it. Since the vulnerability is just a more limited way to accomplish what a malicious build scripts or procedural macros can do, we decided not to publish Rust point releases backporting the security fix. Patch files are available for Rust 1.63.0 are available in the wg-security-response repository for people building their own toolchain. Mitigations We recommend users of alternate registries to exercise care in which package they download, by only including trusted dependencies in their projects. Please note that even with these vulnerabilities fixed, by design Cargo allows arbitrary code execution at build time thanks to build scripts and procedural macros: a malicious dependency will be able to cause damage regardless of these vulnerabilities. crates.io implemented server-side checks to reject these kinds of packages years ago, and there are no packages on crates.io exploiting these vulnerabilities. crates.io users still need to exercise care in choosing their dependencies though, as remote code execution is allowed by design there as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24904: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with version 0.7.0 and prior to versions 2.1.15m 2.2.9, and 2.3.4 is vulnerable to a symlink following bug allowing a malicious user with repository write access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user with write access for a repository which is (or may be) used in a directory-type Application may commit a symlink which points to an out-of-bounds file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include manifest files from other Applications' source repositories (potentially decrypted files, if you are using a decryption plugin) or any JSON-formatted secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.4, 2.2.9, and 2.1.15. Users of versions 2.3.0 or above who do not have any Jsonnet/directory-type Applications may disable the Jsonnet/directory config management tool as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-35631: On MacOS and Linux, it may be possible to perform a symlink attack by replacing this predictable file name with a symlink to another file and have the Velociraptor client overwrite the other file. This issue was resolved in Velociraptor 0.6.5-2.\n\n- CVE-2022-45440: A vulnerability exists in the FTP server of the Zyxel AX7501-B0 firmware prior to V5.17(ABPC.3)C0, which processes symbolic links on external storage media.

            "extended_description": "\n\nRace conditions frequently occur in signal handlers, since signal handlers support asynchronous actions. These race conditions have a variety of root causes and symptoms. Attackers may be able to exploit a signal handler race condition to cause the product state to be corrupted, possibly leading to a denial of service or even code execution.\n\n\nThese issues occur when non-reentrant functions, or state-sensitive actions occur in the signal handler, where they may be called at any time. These behaviors can violate assumptions being made by the \"regular\" code that is interrupted, or by other signal handlers that may also be invoked. If these functions are called at an inopportune moment - such as while a non-reentrant function is already running - memory corruption could occur that may be exploitable for code execution. Another signal race condition commonly found occurs when free is called within a signal handler, resulting in a double free and therefore a write-what-where condition. Even if a given pointer is set to NULL after it has been freed, a race condition still exists between the time the memory was freed and the pointer was set to NULL. This is especially problematic if the same signal handler has been set for more than one signal -- since it means that the signal handler itself may be reentered.\n\n\nThere are several known behaviors related to signal handlers that have received the label of \"signal handler race condition\":\n\n\n  - Shared state (e.g. global data or static variables) that are accessible to both a signal handler and \"regular\" code\n\n  - Shared state between a signal handler and other signal handlers\n\n  - Use of non-reentrant functionality within a signal handler - which generally implies that shared state is being used. For example, malloc() and free() are non-reentrant because they may use global or static data structures for managing memory, and they are indirectly used by innocent-seeming functions such as syslog(); these functions could be exploited for memory corruption and, possibly, code execution.\n\n  - Association of the same signal handler function with multiple signals - which might imply shared state, since the same code and resources are accessed. For example, this can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\n  - Use of setjmp and longjmp, or other mechanisms that prevent a signal handler from returning control back to the original functionality\n\n  - While not technically a race condition, some signal handlers are designed to be called at most once, and being called more than once can introduce security problems, even when there are not any concurrent calls to the signal handler. This can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\nSignal handler vulnerabilities are often classified based on the absence of a specific protection mechanism, although this style of classification is discouraged in CWE because programmers often have a choice of several different mechanisms for addressing the weakness. Such protection mechanisms may preserve exclusivity of access to the shared resource, and behavioral atomicity for the relevant code:\n\n  - Avoiding shared state\n\n  - Using synchronization in the signal handler\n\n  - Using synchronization in the regular code\n\n  - Disabling or masking other signals, which provides atomicity (which effectively ensures exclusivity)\n\n",

              "extended_description": "\n\nRace conditions frequently occur in signal handlers, since signal handlers support asynchronous actions. These race conditions have a variety of root causes and symptoms. Attackers may be able to exploit a signal handler race condition to cause the product state to be corrupted, possibly leading to a denial of service or even code execution.\n\n\nThese issues occur when non-reentrant functions, or state-sensitive actions occur in the signal handler, where they may be called at any time. These behaviors can violate assumptions being made by the \"regular\" code that is interrupted, or by other signal handlers that may also be invoked. If these functions are called at an inopportune moment - such as while a non-reentrant function is already running - memory corruption could occur that may be exploitable for code execution. Another signal race condition commonly found occurs when free is called within a signal handler, resulting in a double free and therefore a write-what-where condition. Even if a given pointer is set to NULL after it has been freed, a race condition still exists between the time the memory was freed and the pointer was set to NULL. This is especially problematic if the same signal handler has been set for more than one signal -- since it means that the signal handler itself may be reentered.\n\n\nThere are several known behaviors related to signal handlers that have received the label of \"signal handler race condition\":\n\n\n  - Shared state (e.g. global data or static variables) that are accessible to both a signal handler and \"regular\" code\n\n  - Shared state between a signal handler and other signal handlers\n\n  - Use of non-reentrant functionality within a signal handler - which generally implies that shared state is being used. For example, malloc() and free() are non-reentrant because they may use global or static data structures for managing memory, and they are indirectly used by innocent-seeming functions such as syslog(); these functions could be exploited for memory corruption and, possibly, code execution.\n\n  - Association of the same signal handler function with multiple signals - which might imply shared state, since the same code and resources are accessed. For example, this can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\n  - Use of setjmp and longjmp, or other mechanisms that prevent a signal handler from returning control back to the original functionality\n\n  - While not technically a race condition, some signal handlers are designed to be called at most once, and being called more than once can introduce security problems, even when there are not any concurrent calls to the signal handler. This can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\nSignal handler vulnerabilities are often classified based on the absence of a specific protection mechanism, although this style of classification is discouraged in CWE because programmers often have a choice of several different mechanisms for addressing the weakness. Such protection mechanisms may preserve exclusivity of access to the shared resource, and behavioral atomicity for the relevant code:\n\n  - Avoiding shared state\n\n  - Using synchronization in the signal handler\n\n  - Using synchronization in the regular code\n\n  - Disabling or masking other signals, which provides atomicity (which effectively ensures exclusivity)\n\n",

These resources include internal buffers, crossbars and switches, individual ports, and channels. The sharing of resources causes contention and introduces interference between differently trusted domains, which poses a security threat via a timing channel, allowing attackers to infer data that belongs to a trusted agent. This may also result in introducing network interference, resulting in degraded throughput and latency.\n",

All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2009-0935: Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice\n\n- CVE-2010-4210: function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.\n\n- CVE-2008-4302: Chain: OS kernel does not properly handle a failure of a function call (CWE-755), leading to an unlock of a resource that was not locked (CWE-832), with resultant crash.\n\n- CVE-2009-1243: OS kernel performs an unlock in some incorrect circumstances, leading to panic.\n\n- CVE-2009-2857: OS deadlock\n\n- CVE-2009-1961: OS deadlock involving 3 separate functions\n\n- CVE-2009-2699: deadlock in library\n\n- CVE-2009-4272: deadlock triggered by packets that force collisions in a routing table\n\n- CVE-2002-1850: read/write deadlock between web server and script\n\n- CVE-2004-0174: web server deadlock involving multiple listening connections\n\n- CVE-2009-1388: multiple simultaneous calls to the same function trigger deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2006-5158: chain: other weakness leads to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) or deadlock (CWE-833).\n\n- CVE-2006-4342: deadlock when an operation is performed on a resource while it is being removed.\n\n- CVE-2006-2374: Deadlock in device driver triggered by using file handle of a related device.\n\n- CVE-2006-2275: Deadlock when large number of small messages cannot be processed quickly enough.\n\n- CVE-2005-3847: OS kernel has deadlock triggered by a signal during a core dump.\n\n- CVE-2005-3106: Race condition leads to deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2005-2456: Chain: array index error (CWE-129) leads to deadlock (CWE-833)\n\n- CVE-2001-0682: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a mutex.\n\n- CVE-2002-1914: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.\n\n- CVE-2002-1915: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.\n\n- CVE-2002-0051: Critical file can be opened with exclusive read access by user, preventing application of security policy. Possibly related to improper permissions, large-window race condition.\n\n- CVE-2000-0338: Chain: predictable file names used for locking, allowing attacker to create the lock beforehand. Resultant from permissions and randomness.\n\n- CVE-2000-1198: Chain: Lock files with predictable names. Resultant from randomness.\n\n- CVE-2002-1869: Product does not check if it can write to a log file, allowing attackers to avoid logging by accessing the file using an exclusive lock. Overlaps unchecked error condition. This is not quite CWE-412, but close.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0529: In memory management driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed.

The fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris). The fix is very small and a git patch is available for those using unsupported versions of Puma.\n\n- CVE-2021-4001: A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's ebpf verifier between bpf_map_update_elem and bpf_map_freeze due to a missing lock in kernel/bpf/syscall.c. In this flaw, a local user with a special privilege (cap_sys_admin or cap_bpf) can modify the frozen mapped address space. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.16 rc2.\n\n- CVE-2021-41141: PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in the C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In various parts of PJSIP, when error/failure occurs, it is found that the function returns without releasing the currently held locks. This could result in a system deadlock, which cause a denial of service for the users. No release has yet been made which contains the linked fix commit.

This vulnerability is due to a deadlock condition in the code when processing COPS packets under certain conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending COPS packets with high burst rates to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the CPU to consume excessive resources, which prevents other control plane processes from obtaining resources and results in a DoS.\n\n- CVE-2021-20291: A deadlock vulnerability was found in 'github.com/containers/storage' in versions before 1.28.1. When a container image is processed, each layer is unpacked using `tar`. If one of those layers is not a valid `tar` archive this causes an error leading to an unexpected situation where the code indefinitely waits for the tar unpacked stream, which never finishes. An attacker could use this vulnerability to craft a malicious image, which when downloaded and stored by an application using containers/storage, would then cause a deadlock leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n- CVE-2021-28951: An issue was discovered in fs/io_uring.c in the Linux kernel through 5.11.8.

            "matched_text": "CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition\n\nType: Base\n\nStatus: Incomplete\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nRace conditions frequently occur in signal handlers, since signal handlers support asynchronous actions. These race conditions have a variety of root causes and symptoms. Attackers may be able to exploit a signal handler race condition to cause the product state to be corrupted, possibly leading to a denial of service or even code execution.\n\n\nThese issues occur when non-reentrant functions, or state-sensitive actions occur in the signal handler, where they may be called at any time. These behaviors can violate assumptions being made by the \"regular\" code that is interrupted, or by other signal handlers that may also be invoked. If these functions are called at an inopportune moment - such as while a non-reentrant function is already running - memory corruption could occur that may be exploitable for code execution. Another signal race condition commonly found occurs when free is called within a signal handler, resulting in a double free and therefore a write-what-where condition. Even if a given pointer is set to NULL after it has been freed, a race condition still exists between the time the memory was freed and the pointer was set to NULL. This is especially problematic if the same signal handler has been set for more than one signal -- since it means that the signal handler itself may be reentered.\n\n\nThere are several known behaviors related to signal handlers that have received the label of \"signal handler race condition\":\n\n\n  - Shared state (e.g. global data or static variables) that are accessible to both a signal handler and \"regular\" code\n\n  - Shared state between a signal handler and other signal handlers\n\n  - Use of non-reentrant functionality within a signal handler - which generally implies that shared state is being used. For example, malloc() and free() are non-reentrant because they may use global or static data structures for managing memory, and they are indirectly used by innocent-seeming functions such as syslog(); these functions could be exploited for memory corruption and, possibly, code execution.\n\n  - Association of the same signal handler function with multiple signals - which might imply shared state, since the same code and resources are accessed. For example, this can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\n  - Use of setjmp and longjmp, or other mechanisms that prevent a signal handler from returning control back to the original functionality\n\n  - While not technically a race condition, some signal handlers are designed to be called at most once, and being called more than once can introduce security problems, even when there are not any concurrent calls to the signal handler. This can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\nSignal handler vulnerabilities are often classified based on the absence of a specific protection mechanism, although this style of classification is discouraged in CWE because programmers often have a choice of several different mechanisms for addressing the weakness. Such protection mechanisms may preserve exclusivity of access to the shared resource, and behavioral atomicity for the relevant code:\n\n  - Avoiding shared state\n\n  - Using synchronization in the signal handler\n\n  - Using synchronization in the regular code\n\n  - Disabling or masking other signals, which provides atomicity (which effectively ensures exclusivity)\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-1999-0035: Signal handler does not disable other signal handlers, allowing it to be interrupted, causing other functionality to access files/etc. with raised privileges\n\n- CVE-2001-0905: Attacker can send a signal while another signal handler is already running, leading to crash or execution with root privileges\n\n- CVE-2001-1349: unsafe calls to library functions from signal handler\n\n- CVE-2004-0794: SIGURG can be used to remotely interrupt signal handler; other variants exist\n\n- CVE-2004-2259: SIGCHLD signal to FTP server can cause crash under heavy load while executing non-reentrant functions like malloc/free.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0244: A signal handler race condition exists in the Layer 2 Address Learning Daemon (L2ALD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS due to the absence of a specific protection mechanism to avoid a race condition which may allow an attacker to bypass the storm-control feature on devices. This issue is a corner case and only occurs during specific actions taken by an administrator of a device under certain specifics actions which triggers the event. The event occurs less frequently on devices which are not configured with Virtual Chassis configurations, and more frequently on devices configured in Virtual Chassis configurations.

The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-0280: A race condition vulnerability exists in the QuickClean feature of McAfee Total Protection for Windows prior to 16.0.43 that allows a local user to gain privilege elevation and perform an arbitrary file delete. This could lead to sensitive files being deleted and potentially cause denial of service. This attack exploits the way symlinks are created and how the product works with them.\n\n- CVE-2022-0915: There is a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition Vulnerability in Logitech Sync for Windows prior to 2.4.574. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may escalate the permission to the system user.\n\n- CVE-2022-21198: Time-of-check time-of-use race condition in the BIOS firmware for some Intel(R) Processors may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\n\n- CVE-2022-23651: b2-sdk-python is a python library to access cloud storage provided by backblaze. Linux and Mac releases of the SDK version 1.14.0 and below contain a key disclosure vulnerability that, in certain conditions, can be exploited by local attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. SDK users of the SqliteAccountInfo format are vulnerable while users of the InMemoryAccountInfo format are safe. The SqliteAccountInfo saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping) in a local database file ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info, ~/.b2_account_info or a user-defined path). When first created, the file is world readable and is (typically a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the user. If the directory containing the file is readable by a local attacker then during the brief period between file creation and permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file and maintain a handle to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents after the file after the sensitive information has been saved to it. Consumers of this SDK who rely on it to save data using SqliteAccountInfo class should upgrade to the latest version of the SDK. Those who believe a local user might have opened a handle using this race condition, should remove the affected database files and regenerate all application keys. Users should upgrade to b2-sdk-python 1.14.1 or later.\n\n- CVE-2022-23653: B2 Command Line Tool is the official command line tool for the backblaze cloud storage service. Linux and Mac releases of the B2 command-line tool version 3.2.0 and below contain a key disclosure vulnerability that, in certain conditions, can be exploited by local attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. The command line tool saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping) in a local database file (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info`, `~/.b2_account_info` or a user-defined path) when `b2 authorize-account` is first run. This happens regardless of whether a valid key is provided or not. When first created, the file is world readable and is (typically a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the user. If the directory is readable by a local attacker and the user did not yet run `b2 authorize-account` then during the brief period between file creation and permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file and maintain a handle to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents after the file after the sensitive information has been saved to it. Users that have not yet run `b2 authorize-account` should upgrade to B2 Command-Line Tool v3.2.1 before running it. Users that have run `b2 authorize-account` are safe if at the time of the file creation no other local users had read access to the local configuration file. Users that have run `b2 authorize-account` where the designated path could be opened by another local user should upgrade to B2 Command-Line Tool v3.2.1 and remove the database and regenerate all application keys. Note that `b2 clear-account` does not remove the database file and it should not be used to ensure that all open handles to the file are invalidated. If B2 Command-Line Tool cannot be upgraded to v3.2.1 due to a dependency conflict, a binary release can be used instead. Alternatively a new version could be installed within a virtualenv, or the permissions can be changed to prevent local users from opening the database file.\n\n- CVE-2022-25165: An issue was discovered in Amazon AWS VPN Client 2.0.0. A TOCTOU race condition exists during the validation of VPN configuration files. This allows parameters outside of the AWS VPN Client allow list to be injected into the configuration file prior to the AWS VPN Client service (running as SYSTEM) processing the file. Dangerous arguments can be injected by a low-level user such as log, which allows an arbitrary destination to be specified for writing log files. This leads to an arbitrary file write as SYSTEM with partial control over the files content. This can be abused to cause an elevation of privilege or denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2022-26859: Dell BIOS contains a race condition vulnerability. A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious input via SMI in order to bypass security checks during SMM.\n\n- CVE-2022-28743: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulerability in Foscam R2C IP camera running System FW <= 1.13.1.6, and Application FW <= 2.91.2.66, allows an authenticated remote attacker with administrator permissions to execute arbitrary remote code via a malicious firmware patch. The impact of this vulnerability is that the remote attacker could gain full remote access to the IP camera and the underlying Linux system with root permissions. With root access to the camera's Linux OS, an attacker could effectively change the code that is running, add backdoor access, or invade the privacy of the user by accessing the live camera stream.\n\n- CVE-2022-29800: A time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition vulnerability was found in networkd-dispatcher. This flaw exists because there is a certain time between the scripts being discovered and them being run. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to replace scripts that networkd-dispatcher believes to be owned by root with ones that are not.\n\n- CVE-2022-31466: Time of Check - Time of Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability in Quick Heal Total Security prior to 12.1.1.27 allows a local attacker to achieve privilege escalation, potentially leading to deletion of system files. This is achieved through exploiting the time between detecting a file as malicious and when the action of quarantining or cleaning is performed, and using the time to replace the malicious file by a symlink.\n\n- CVE-2022-33691: A possible race condition vulnerability in score driver prior to SMR Jul-2022 Release 1 can allow local attackers to interleave malicious operations.\n\n- CVE-2022-34830: An Arm product family through 2022-06-29 has a TOCTOU Race Condition that allows non-privileged user to make improper GPU processing operations to gain access to already freed memory.\n\n- CVE-2022-34899: This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Parallels Access 6.5.4 (39316) Agent. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target host system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the Parallels service. By creating a symbolic link, an attacker can abuse the service to execute a file. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of root.

Because of a TOCTOU race condition between the validation checks and the HTTP request, attackers can reach internal hosts that are explicitly forbidden.\n\n- CVE-2022-45842: Unauth. Race Condition vulnerability in WP ULike Plugin <= 4.6.4 on WordPress allows attackers to increase/decrease rating scores. \n\n- CVE-2022-1537: file.copy operations in GruntJS are vulnerable to a TOCTOU race condition leading to arbitrary file write in GitHub repository gruntjs/grunt prior to 1.5.3. This vulnerability is capable of arbitrary file writes which can lead to local privilege escalation to the GruntJS user if a lower-privileged user has write access to both source and destination directories as the lower-privileged user can create a symlink to the GruntJS user's .bashrc file or replace /etc/shadow file if the GruntJS user is root.\n\n- CVE-2022-21658: Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the `std::fs::remove_dir_all` standard library function is vulnerable a race condition enabling symlink following (CWE-363). An attacker could use this security issue to trick a privileged program into deleting files and directories the attacker couldn't otherwise access or delete. Rust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.58.0 is affected by this vulnerability with 1.58.1 containing a patch. Note that the following build targets don't have usable APIs to properly mitigate the attack, and are thus still vulnerable even with a patched toolchain: macOS before version 10.10 (Yosemite) and REDOX. We recommend everyone to update to Rust 1.58.1 as soon as possible, especially people developing programs expected to run in privileged contexts (including system daemons and setuid binaries), as those have the highest risk of being affected by this. Note that adding checks in your codebase before calling remove_dir_all will not mitigate the vulnerability, as they would also be vulnerable to race conditions like remove_dir_all itself. The existing mitigation is working as intended outside of race conditions.\n\n- CVE-2022-23563: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. In multiple places, TensorFlow uses `tempfile.mktemp` to create temporary files. While this is acceptable in testing, in utilities and libraries it is dangerous as a different process can create the file between the check for the filename in `mktemp` and the actual creation of the file by a subsequent operation (a TOC/TOU type of weakness). In several instances, TensorFlow was supposed to actually create a temporary directory instead of a file. This logic bug is hidden away by the `mktemp` function usage. We have patched the issue in several commits, replacing `mktemp` with the safer `mkstemp`/`mkdtemp` functions, according to the usage pattern. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-4098: Insufficient data validation in Mojo in Google Chrome prior to 96.0.4664.110 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to potentially perform a sandbox escape via a crafted HTML page.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-362 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-362 (ChildOf)",

When a signal handler uses global or static variables, or invokes functions that ultimately depend on such state or its associated metadata, then it could corrupt system state that is being used by normal functionality. This could subject the program to race conditions or other weaknesses that allow an attacker to cause the program state to be corrupted. While denial of service is frequently the consequence, in some cases this weakness could be leveraged for code execution.\n\n\nThere are several different scenarios that introduce this issue:\n\n\n  - Invocation of non-reentrant functions from within the handler. One example is malloc(), which modifies internal global variables as it manages memory. Very few functions are actually reentrant.\n\n  - Code sequences (not necessarily function calls) contain non-atomic use of global variables, or associated metadata or structures, that can be accessed by other functionality of the program, including other signal handlers. Frequently, the same function is registered to handle multiple signals.\n\n  - The signal handler function is intended to run at most one time, but instead it can be invoked multiple times. This could happen by repeated delivery of the same signal, or by delivery of different signals that have the same handler function (CWE-831).\n\nNote that in some environments or contexts, it might be possible for the signal handler to be interrupted itself.\n\nIf both a signal handler and the normal behavior of the product have to operate on the same set of state variables, and a signal is received in the middle of the normal execution's modifications of those variables, the variables may be in an incorrect or corrupt state during signal handler execution, and possibly still incorrect or corrupt upon return.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2008-4109: Signal handler uses functions that ultimately call the unsafe syslog/malloc/s*printf, leading to denial of service via multiple login attempts\n\n- CVE-2006-5051: Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n\n- CVE-2001-1349: unsafe calls to library functions from signal handler\n\n- CVE-2004-0794: SIGURG can be used to remotely interrupt signal handler; other variants exist.\n\n- CVE-2004-2259: SIGCHLD signal to FTP server can cause crash under heavy load while executing non-reentrant functions like malloc/free.\n\n- CVE-2002-1563: SIGCHLD not blocked in a daemon loop while counter is modified, causing counter to get out of sync.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-364 (ChildOf)",

In the case where an interrupt is not quiescent yet at the time this cleanup gets invoked, the cleanup attempt may be scheduled to be retried. When multiple interrupts are involved, this scheduling of a retry may get erroneously skipped. At the same time pointers may get cleared (resulting in a de-reference of NULL) and freed (resulting in a use-after-free), while other code would continue to assume them to be valid.\n\n- CVE-2022-1473: The OPENSSL_LH_flush() function, which empties a hash table, contains a bug that breaks reuse of the memory occuppied by the removed hash table entries. This function is used when decoding certificates or keys. If a long lived process periodically decodes certificates or keys its memory usage will expand without bounds and the process might be terminated by the operating system causing a denial of service. Also traversing the empty hash table entries will take increasingly more time. Typically such long lived processes might be TLS clients or TLS servers configured to accept client certificate authentication. The function was added in the OpenSSL 3.0 version thus older releases are not affected by the issue.

The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, get de-allocated when a guest switched (back) from v2 to v1. The freeing of such pages requires that the hypervisor know where in the guest these pages were mapped. The hypervisor tracks only one use within guest space, but racing requests from the guest to insert mappings of these pages may result in any of them to become mapped in multiple locations. Upon switching back from v2 to v1, the guest would then retain access to a page that was freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes.\n\n- CVE-2021-28701: Another race in XENMAPSPACE_grant_table handling Guests are permitted access to certain Xen-owned pages of memory. The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, are de-allocated when a guest switches (back) from v2 to v1. Freeing such pages requires that the hypervisor enforce that no parallel request can result in the addition of a mapping of such a page to a guest. That enforcement was missing, allowing guests to retain access to pages that were freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes. Unfortunately, when XSA-379 was being prepared, this similar issue was not noticed.\n\n- CVE-2020-11492: An issue was discovered in Docker Desktop through 2.2.0.5 on Windows.

When restoring tensors via raw APIs, if the tensor name is not provided, TensorFlow can be tricked into dereferencing a null pointer. Alternatively, attackers can read memory outside the bounds of heap allocated data by providing some tensor names but not enough for a successful restoration. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/47a06f40411a69c99f381495f490536972152ac0/tensorflow/core/kernels/save_restore_tensor.cc#L158-L159) retrieves the tensor list corresponding to the `tensor_name` user controlled input and immediately retrieves the tensor at the restoration index (controlled via `preferred_shard` argument). This occurs without validating that the provided list has enough values. If the list is empty this results in dereferencing a null pointer (undefined behavior). If, however, the list has some elements, if the restoration index is outside the bounds this results in heap OOB read. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 9e82dce6e6bd1f36a57e08fa85af213e2b2f2622. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0.

Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-25926: Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.\n\n- CVE-2021-25963: Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\n\n- CVE-2021-1879: Universal XSS in mobile operating system, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-3580: Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in firewall product leads to XSS (CWE-79), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2014-8958: Admin GUI allows XSS through cookie.\n\n- CVE-2017-9764: Web stats program allows XSS through crafted HTTP header.\n\n- CVE-2014-5198: Web log analysis product allows XSS through crafted HTTP Referer header.\n\n- CVE-2008-5080: Chain: protection mechanism failure allows XSS\n\n- CVE-2006-4308: Chain: incomplete denylist (CWE-184) only checks \"javascript:\" tag, allowing XSS (CWE-79) using other tags\n\n- CVE-2007-5727: Chain: incomplete denylist (CWE-184) only removes SCRIPT tags, enabling XSS (CWE-79)\n\n- CVE-2008-5770: Reflected XSS using the PATH_INFO in a URL\n\n- CVE-2008-4730: Reflected XSS not properly handled when generating an error message\n\n- CVE-2008-5734: Reflected XSS sent through email message.\n\n- CVE-2008-0971: Stored XSS in a security product.\n\n- CVE-2008-5249: Stored XSS using a wiki page.\n\n- CVE-2006-3568: Stored XSS in a guestbook application.\n\n- CVE-2006-3211: Stored XSS in a guestbook application using a javascript: URI in a bbcode img tag.\n\n- CVE-2006-3295: Chain: library file is not protected against a direct request (CWE-425), leading to reflected XSS (CWE-79).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-7050: Codologic Codoforum through 4.8.4 allows a DOM-based XSS. While creating a new topic as a normal user, it is possible to add a poll that is automatically loaded in the DOM once the thread/topic is opened. Because session cookies lack the HttpOnly flag, it is possible to steal authentication cookies and take over accounts.\n\n- CVE-2020-7051: Codologic Codoforum through 4.8.4 allows stored XSS in the login area. This is relevant in conjunction with CVE-2020-5842 because session cookies lack the HttpOnly flag. The impact is account takeover.\n\n- CVE-2021-1543: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an attacker to do the following: Hijack a user session Execute arbitrary commands as a root user on the underlying operating system Conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack Conduct an HTML injection attack For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-21260: Online Invoicing System (OIS) is open source software which is a lean invoicing system for small businesses, consultants and freelancers created using AppGini. In OIS version 4.0 there is a stored XSS which can enables an attacker takeover of the admin account through a payload that extracts a csrf token and sends a request to change password. It has been found that Item description is reflected without sanitization in app/items_view.php which enables the malicious scenario.\n\n- CVE-2021-21283: Flarum is an open source discussion platform for websites. The \"Flarum Sticky\" extension versions 0.1.0-beta.14 and 0.1.0-beta.15 has a cross-site scripting vulnerability. A change in release beta 14 of the Sticky extension caused the plain text content of the first post of a pinned discussion to be injected as HTML on the discussion list. The issue was discovered following an internal audit. Any HTML would be injected through the m.trust() helper. This resulted in an HTML injection where <script> tags would not be executed. However it was possible to run javascript from other HTML attributes, enabling a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack to be performed. Since the exploit only happens with the first post of a pinned discussion, an attacker would need the ability to pin their own discussion, or be able to edit a discussion that was previously pinned. On forums where all pinned posts are authored by your staff, you can be relatively certain the vulnerability has not been exploited. Forums where some user-created discussions were pinned can look at the first post edit date to find whether the vulnerability might have been exploited. Because Flarum doesn't store the post content history, you cannot be certain if a malicious edit was reverted. The fix will be available in version v0.1.0-beta.16 with Flarum beta 16. The fix has already been back-ported to Flarum beta 15 as version v0.1.0-beta.15.1 of the Sticky extension. Forum administrators can disable the Sticky extension until they are able to apply the update. The vulnerability cannot be exploited while the extension is disabled.\n\n- CVE-2021-21332: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.27.0, the password reset endpoint served via Synapse was vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The impact depends on the configuration of the domain that Synapse is deployed on, but may allow access to cookies and other browser data, CSRF vulnerabilities, and access to other resources served on the same domain or parent domains. This is fixed in version 1.27.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-22223: Client-Side code injection through Feature Flag name in GitLab CE/EE starting with 11.9 allows a specially crafted feature flag name to PUT requests on behalf of other users via clicking on a link\n\n- CVE-2021-22722: A CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Stored Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could cause code injection when importing a CSV file or changing station parameters.\n\n- CVE-2021-22723: A CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-siteScripting) through Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could allow an attacker to impersonate the user who manages the charging station or carry out actions on their behalf when crafted malicious parameters are submitted to the charging station web server.\n\n- CVE-2021-24301: The Hotjar Connecticator WordPress plugin through 1.1.1 is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the 'hotjar script' textarea. The request did include a CSRF nonce that was properly verified by the server and this vulnerability could only be exploited by administrator users.\n\n- CVE-2021-24891: The Elementor Website Builder WordPress plugin before 3.4.8 does not sanitise or escape user input appended to the DOM via a malicious hash, resulting in a DOM Cross-Site Scripting issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-25955: In \u201cDolibarr ERP CRM\u201d, WYSIWYG Editor module, v2.8.1 to v13.0.2 are affected by a stored XSS vulnerability that allows low privileged application users to store malicious scripts in the \u201cPrivate Note\u201d field at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint. These scripts are executed in a victim\u2019s browser when they open the page containing the vulnerable field. In the worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged administrator. The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account takeover of the admin and due to other vulnerability (Improper Access Control on Private notes) a low privileged user can update the private notes which could lead to privilege escalation.\n\n- CVE-2021-26929: An XSS issue was discovered in Horde Groupware Webmail Edition through 5.2.22 (where the Horde_Text_Filter library before 2.3.7 is used). The attacker can send a plain text e-mail message, with JavaScript encoded as a link or email that is mishandled by preProcess in Text2html.php, because bespoke use of \\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00 and \\\\x01\\\\x01\\\\x01 interferes with XSS defenses.\n\n- CVE-2021-29208: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29209: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29210: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29459: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. It is possible to persistently inject scripts in XWiki versions prior to 12.6.3 and 12.8. Unregistred users can fill simple text fields. Registered users can fill in their personal information and (if they have edit rights) fill the values of static lists using App Within Minutes. There is no easy workaround except upgrading XWiki. The vulnerability has been patched on XWiki 12.8 and 12.6.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32772: Poddycast is a podcast app made with Electron. Prior to version 0.8.1, an attacker can create a podcast or episode with malicious characters and execute commands on the client machine. The application does not clean the HTML characters of the podcast information obtained from the Feed, which allows the injection of HTML and JS code (cross-site scripting). Being an application made in electron, cross-site scripting can be scaled to remote code execution, making it possible to execute commands on the machine where the application is running. The vulnerability is patched in Poddycast version 0.8.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-34656: The 2Way VideoCalls and Random Chat - HTML5 Webcam Videochat WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the `vws_notice` function found in the ~/inc/requirements.php file which allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 5.2.7.\n\n- CVE-2021-34763: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an attacker to execute a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or an open redirect attack.

The value of the URL path filename is copied into the HTML document as plain text tags.\n\n- CVE-2021-3529: A flaw was found in noobaa-core in versions before 5.7.0. This flaw results in the name of an arbitrarily URL being copied into an HTML document as plain text between tags, including potentially a payload script. The input was echoed unmodified in the application response, resulting in arbitrary JavaScript being injected into an application's response. The highest threat to the system is for confidentiality, availability, and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-39186: GlobalNewFiles is a MediaWiki extension maintained by Miraheze. Prior to commit number cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d, the username column of the GlobalNewFiles special page is vulnerable to a stored XSS. Commit number cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d contains a patch. As a workaround, one may disallow <,> (or other characters required to insert html/js) from being used in account names so an XSS is not possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-37541: In JetBrains Hub before 2021.1.13402, HTML injection in the password reset email was possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-34419: In the Zoom Client for Meetings for Ubuntu Linux before version 5.1.0, there is an HTML injection flaw when sending a remote control request to a user in the process of in-meeting screen sharing.

This vulnerability allows attackers to execute phishing attacks, external redirects, and arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-39348: The LearnPress WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient escaping on the $custom_profile parameter found in the ~/inc/admin/views/backend-user-profile.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 4.1.3.1. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled. Please note that this is seperate from CVE-2021-24702.\n\n- CVE-2021-21333: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.27.0, the notification emails sent for notifications for missed messages or for an expiring account are subject to HTML injection. In the case of the notification for missed messages, this could allow an attacker to insert forged content into the email. The account expiry feature is not enabled by default and the HTML injection is not controllable by an attacker. This is fixed in version 1.27.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-42663: An HTML injection vulnerability exists in Sourcecodester Online Event Booking and Reservation System in PHP/MySQL via the msg parameter to /event-management/index.php. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability in order to change the visibility of the website. Once the target user clicks on a given link he will display the content of the HTML code of the attacker's choice.\n\n- CVE-2021-41248: GraphiQL is the reference implementation of this monorepo, GraphQL IDE, an official project under the GraphQL Foundation. All versions of graphiql older than graphiql@1.4.7 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a vulnerable schema in graphiql. There are a number of ways that can occur. By default, the schema URL is not attacker-controllable in graphiql or in its suggested implementations or examples, leaving only very complex attack vectors. If a custom implementation of graphiql's fetcher allows the schema URL to be set dynamically, such as a URL query parameter like ?endpoint= in graphql-playground, or a database provided value, then this custom graphiql implementation is vulnerable to phishing attacks, and thus much more readily available, low or no privelege level xss attacks. The URLs could look like any generic looking graphql schema URL. It should be noted that desktop clients such as Altair, Insomnia, Postwoman, do not appear to be impacted by this. This vulnerability does not impact codemirror-graphql, monaco-graphql or other dependents, as it exists in onHasCompletion.ts in graphiql. It does impact all forks of graphiql, and every released version of graphiql.\n\n- CVE-2021-41249: GraphQL Playground is a GraphQL IDE for development of graphQL focused applications. All versions of graphql-playground-react older than graphql-playground-react@1.7.28 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a malicious schema in graphql-playground. There are several ways this can occur, including by specifying the URL to a malicious schema in the endpoint query parameter. If a user clicks on a link to a GraphQL Playground installation that specifies a malicious server, arbitrary JavaScript can run in the user's browser, which can be used to exfiltrate user credentials or other harmful goals. If you are using graphql-playground-react directly in your client app, upgrade to version 1.7.28 or later.\n\n- CVE-2021-41825: Verint Workforce Optimization (WFO) 15.2.5.1033 allows HTML injection via the /wfo/control/signin username parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-42564: An open redirect through HTML injection in confidential messages in Cryptshare before 5.1.0 allows remote attackers (with permission to provide confidential messages via Cryptshare) to redirect targeted victims to any URL via the '<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\"' substring in the editor parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-43683: pictshare v1.5 is affected by a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in api/info.php. The exit function will terminate the script and print the message which has $_REQUEST['hash'].\n\n- CVE-2021-31682: The login portal for the Automated Logic WebCTRL/WebCTRL OEM web application contains a vulnerability that allows for reflected XSS attacks due to the operatorlocale GET parameter not being sanitized. This issue impacts versions 6.5 and below. This issue works by passing in a basic XSS payload to a vulnerable GET parameter that is reflected in the output without sanitization.\n\n- CVE-2021-21313: GLPI is open source software which stands for Gestionnaire Libre de Parc Informatique and it is a Free Asset and IT Management Software package. In GLPI before verison 9.5.4, there is a vulnerability in the /ajax/common.tabs.php endpoint, indeed, at least two parameters _target and id are not properly sanitized.

This can then be leveraged to execute a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack to escalate privileges to administrator.\n\n- CVE-2021-43862: jQuery Terminal Emulator is a plugin for creating command line interpreters in your applications. Versions prior to 2.31.1 contain a low impact and limited cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The code for XSS payload is always visible, but an attacker can use other techniques to hide the code the victim sees. If the application uses the `execHash` option and executes code from URL, the attacker can use this URL to execute their code. The scope is limited because the javascript attribute used is added to span tag, so no automatic execution like with `onerror` on images is possible. This issue is fixed in version 2.31.1. As a workaround, the user can use formatting that wrap whole user input and its no op. The code for this workaround is available in the GitHub Security Advisory. The fix will only work when user of the library is not using different formatters (e.g. to highlight code in different way).\n\n- CVE-2021-43961: Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager 3.36.0 allows HTML Injection.\n\n- CVE-2021-44082: textpattern 4.8.7 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) via /textpattern/index.php,Body. A remote and unauthenticated attacker can use XSS to trigger remote code execution by uploading a webshell. To do so they must first steal the CSRF token before submitting a file upload request.\n\n- CVE-2021-44120: SPIP 4.0.0 is affected by a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in ecrire/public/interfaces.php, adding the function safehtml to the vulnerable fields. An editor is able to modify his personal information. If the editor has an article written and available, when a user goes to the public site and wants to read the author's information, the malicious code will be executed. The \"Who are you\" and \"Website Name\" fields are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2021-46426: phpIPAM 1.4.4 allows Reflected XSS and CSRF via app/admin/subnets/find_free_section_subnets.php of the subnets functionality.\n\n- CVE-2020-13673: The Entity Embed module provides a filter to allow embedding entities in content fields.

Argo CD starting with 2.3.0 and prior to 2.3.6 and 2.4.5 is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript in the `/auth/callback` page in a victim's browser. This vulnerability only affects Argo CD instances which have single sign on (SSO) enabled. The exploit also assumes the attacker has 1) access to the API server's encryption key, 2) a method to add a cookie to the victim's browser, and 3) the ability to convince the victim to visit a malicious `/auth/callback` link. The vulnerability is classified as low severity because access to the API server's encryption key already grants a high level of access. Exploiting the XSS would allow the attacker to impersonate the victim, but would not grant any privileges which the attacker could not otherwise gain using the encryption key. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions 2.4.5 and 2.3.6. There is currently no known workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-3242: Code Injection in GitHub repository microweber/microweber prior to 1.3.2.\n\n- CVE-2022-32763: A cross-site scripting (xss) sanitization vulnerability bypass exists in the SanitizeHtml functionality of Lansweeper lansweeper 10.1.1.0.

To mitigate this attack, browsers placed limits on <code>fetch()</code> and XMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have implemented non-standard headers such as <code>X-Http-Method-Override</code> that override the HTTP method, and made this attack possible again. Thunderbird has applied the same mitigations to the use of this and similar headers. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.\n\n- CVE-2022-39207: Onedev is an open source, self-hosted Git Server with CI/CD and Kanban. During CI/CD builds, it is possible to save build artifacts for later retrieval. They can be accessed through OneDev's web UI after the successful run of a build. These artifact files are served by the webserver in the same context as the UI without any further restrictions. This leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when a user creates a build artifact that contains HTML. When accessing the artifact, the content is rendered by the browser, including any JavaScript that it contains. Since all cookies (except for the rememberMe one) do not set the HttpOnly flag, an attacker could steal the session of a victim and use it to impersonate them. To exploit this issue, attackers need to be able to modify the content of artifacts, which usually means they need to be able to modify a project's build spec. The exploitation requires the victim to click on an attacker's link. It can be used to elevate privileges by targeting admins of a OneDev instance. In the worst case, this can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, because admins can create Server Shell Executors and use them to run any command on the server. This issue has been patched in version 7.3.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-3033: If a Thunderbird user replied to a crafted HTML email containing a <code>meta</code> tag, with the <code>meta</code> tag having the <code>http-equiv=\"refresh\"</code> attribute, and the content attribute specifying an URL, then Thunderbird started a network request to that URL, regardless of the configuration to block remote content. In combination with certain other HTML elements and attributes in the email, it was possible to execute JavaScript code included in the message in the context of the message compose document. The JavaScript code was able to perform actions including, but probably not limited to, read and modify the contents of the message compose document, including the quoted original message, which could potentially contain the decrypted plaintext of encrypted data in the crafted email. The contents could then be transmitted to the network, either to the URL specified in the META refresh tag, or to a different URL, as the JavaScript code could modify the URL specified in the document. This bug doesn't affect users who have changed the default Message Body display setting to 'simple html' or 'plain text'. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.2.1 and Thunderbird < 91.13.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-29444: Plugin Settings Change leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Cloudways Breeze plugin <= 2.0.2 on WordPress allows users with a subscriber or higher user role to execute any of the wp_ajax_* actions in the class Breeze_Configuration which includes the ability to change any of the plugin's settings including CDN setting which could be further used for XSS attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-36176: Multiple uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerabilities in the web interface of FortiPortal before 6.0.6 may allow a single low-privileged user to induce a denial of service via multiple HTTP requests.\n\n- CVE-2021-43929: Improper neutralization of special elements in output used by a downstream component ('Injection') vulnerability in work flow management in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 7.0.1-42218-2 allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2022-2178: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Saysis Computer Starcities allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).This issue affects Starcities: before 1.1. \n\n- CVE-2022-38628: Nortek Linear eMerge E3-Series 0.32-08f, 0.32-07p, 0.32-07e, 0.32-09c, 0.32-09b, 0.32-09a, and 0.32-08e were discovered to contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability which is chained with a local session fixation.

An attacker is able to inject arbitrary `CSS` into the generated graph allowing them to change the styling of elements outside of the generated graph, and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information by using specially crafted `CSS` selectors. The following example shows how an attacker can exfiltrate the contents of an input field by bruteforcing the `value` attribute one character at a time. Whenever there is an actual match, an `http` request will be made by the browser in order to \"load\" a background image that will let an attacker know what's the value of the character. This issue may lead to `Information Disclosure` via CSS selectors and functions able to generate HTTP requests. This also allows an attacker to change the document in ways which may lead a user to perform unintended actions, such as clicking on a link, etc. This issue has been resolved in version 9.1.3.

In affected versions due to incomplete validation in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeV2`, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/84d053187cb80d975ef2b9684d4b61981bca0c41/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_op.cc#L59) has some validation but does not check that `min_range` and `max_range` both have the same non-zero number of elements. If `axis` is provided (i.e., not `-1`), then validation should check that it is a value in range for the rank of `input` tensor and then the lengths of `min_range` and `max_range` inputs match the `axis` dimension of the `input` tensor. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 6da6620efad397c85493b8f8667b821403516708. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0.

Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-25727: Memory Corruption in modem due to improper length check while copying into memory in Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Voice & Music\n\n- CVE-2022-25793: A Stack-based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in Autodesk 3ds Max 2022, 2021, and 2020 may lead to code execution through the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer when parsing ActionScript Byte Code files.

Azure RTOS USBX implementation of host support for USB CDC ECM includes an integer underflow and a buffer overflow in the `_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function which may be potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution or denial of service. Setting mac address string descriptor length to a `0` or `1` allows an attacker to introduce an integer underflow followed (string_length) by a buffer overflow of the `cdc_ecm -> ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id` array. This may allow one to redirect the code execution flow or introduce a denial of service. The fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel).

Prior to version 0.10.2, the heap initialization methods were missing a minimum size check for the given heap size argument. This could lead to out-of-bound writes when a heap was initialized with a size smaller than `3 * size_of::<usize>` because of metadata write operations. This vulnerability impacts all the initialization functions on the `Heap` and `LockedHeap` types, including `Heap::new`, `Heap::init`, `Heap::init_from_slice`, and `LockedHeap::new`. It also affects multiple uses of the `Heap::extend` method. Version 0.10.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, ensure that the heap is only initialized with a size larger than `3 * size_of::<usize>` and that the `Heap::extend` method is only called with sizes larger than `2 * size_of::<usize>()`. Also, ensure that the total heap size is (and stays) a multiple of `2 * size_of::<usize>()`.\n\n- CVE-2022-36938: DexLoader function get_stringidx_fromdex() in Redex prior to commit 3b44c64 can load an out of bound address when loading the string index table, potentially allowing remote code execution during processing of a 3rd party Android APK file.\n\n- CVE-2021-1058: NVIDIA vGPU software contains a vulnerability in the guest kernel mode driver and vGPU plugin, in which an input data size is not validated, which may lead to tampering of data or denial of service.

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 39ec7eaf1428e90c37787e5b3fbd68ebd3c48860. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-48297: The geofencing kernel code has a vulnerability of not verifying the length of the input data. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause out-of-bounds memory access.\n\n- CVE-2022-48298: The geofencing kernel code does not verify the length of the input data. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause out-of-bounds memory access.\n\n- CVE-2021-0934: In findAllDeAccounts of AccountsDb.java, there is a possible denial of service due to resource exhaustion. This could lead to local denial of service with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-12 Android-12L Android-13Android ID: A-169762606\n\n- CVE-2021-28510: For certain systems running EOS, a Precision Time Protocol (PTP) packet of a management/signaling message with an invalid Type-Length-Value (TLV) causes the PTP agent to restart. Repeated restarts of the service will make the service unavailable.\n\n- CVE-2022-0214: The Custom Popup Builder WordPress plugin before 1.3.1 autoload data from its popup on every pages, as such data can be sent by unauthenticated user, and is not validated in length, this could cause a denial of service on the blog\n\n- CVE-2022-1174: A potential DoS vulnerability was discovered in Gitlab CE/EE versions 13.7 before 14.7.7, all versions starting from 14.8 before 14.8.5, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.2 allowed an attacker to trigger high CPU usage via a special crafted input added in Issues, Merge requests, Milestones, Snippets, Wiki pages, etc.\n\n- CVE-2022-23319: A segmentation fault during PCF file parsing in pcf2bdf versions >=1.05 allows an attacker to trigger a program crash via a specially crafted PCF font file. This crash affects the availability of the software and dependent downstream components.\n\n- CVE-2022-23580: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. During shape inference, TensorFlow can allocate a large vector based on a value from a tensor controlled by the user. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-29202: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.ragged.constant` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a denial of service by consuming all available memory. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36078: Binary provides encoding/decoding in Borsh and other formats. The vulnerability is a memory allocation vulnerability that can be exploited to allocate slices in memory with (arbitrary) excessive size value, which can either exhaust available memory or crash the whole program. When using `github.com/gagliardetto/binary` to parse unchecked (or wrong type of) data from untrusted sources of input (e.g. the blockchain) into slices, it's possible to allocate memory with excessive size. When `dec.Decode(&val)` method is used to parse data into a structure that is or contains slices of values, the length of the slice was previously read directly from the data itself without any checks on the size of it, and then a slice was allocated. This could lead to an overflow and an allocation of memory with excessive size value. Users should upgrade to `v0.7.1` or higher. A workaround is not to rely on the `dec.Decode(&val)` function to parse the data, but to use a custom `UnmarshalWithDecoder()` method that reads and checks the length of any slice.\n\n- CVE-2022-37311: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large location request parameter to the redirect servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-37312: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large request body containing a redirect URL to the deferrer servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-39294: conduit-hyper integrates a conduit application with the hyper server. Prior to version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` did not check any limit on a request's length before calling [`hyper::body::to_bytes`](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/body/fn.to_bytes.html). An attacker could send a malicious request with an abnormally large `Content-Length`, which could lead to a panic if memory allocation failed for that request. In version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` sets an internal limit of 128 MiB per request, otherwise returning status 400 (\"Bad Request\"). This crate is part of the implementation of Rust's [crates.io](https://crates.io/), but that service is not affected due to its existing cloud infrastructure, which already drops such malicious requests. Even with the new limit in place, `conduit-hyper` is not recommended for production use, nor to directly serve the public Internet.\n\n- CVE-2022-4111: Unrestricted file size limit can lead to DoS in tooljet/tooljet <1.27 by allowing a logged in attacker to upload profile pictures over 2MB. \n\n- CVE-2022-41968: Nextcloud Server is an open source personal cloud server. Prior to versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.5, calendar name lengths are not validated before writing to a database. As a result, an attacker can send unnecessary amounts of data against the database. Version 23.0.10 and 24.0.5 contain patches for the issue. No known workarounds are available.\n\n- CVE-2022-20488: In NotificationChannel of NotificationChannel.java, there is a possible failure to persist permissions settings due to resource exhaustion. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-12 Android-12L Android-13Android ID: A-242703217\n\n- CVE-2022-20491: In NotificationChannel of NotificationChannel.java, there is a possible failure to persist permissions settings due to resource exhaustion. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-12 Android-12L Android-13Android ID: A-242703556\n\n- CVE-2022-20691: A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol functionality of Cisco ATA 190 Series Adaptive Telephone Adapter firmware could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a DoS condition of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to missing length validation of certain Cisco Discovery Protocol packet header fields. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to exhaust available memory and cause the service to restart. Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability. \n\n- CVE-2022-21208: The package node-opcua before 2.74.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to a missing limitation on the number of received chunks - per single session or in total for all concurrent sessions. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending an unlimited number of huge chunks (e.g. 2GB each) without sending the Final closing chunk.\n\n- CVE-2022-29212: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, certain TFLite models that were created using TFLite model converter would crash when loaded in the TFLite interpreter. The culprit is that during quantization the scale of values could be greater than 1 but code was always assuming sub-unit scaling. Thus, since code was calling `QuantizeMultiplierSmallerThanOneExp`, the `TFLITE_CHECK_LT` assertion would trigger and abort the process. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29196: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackpropFilterV2` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate that the `filter_sizes` argument is a vector. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29200: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.LSTMBlockCell` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate the ranks of any of the arguments to this API call. This results in `CHECK`-failures when the elements of the tensor are accessed. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-789 (CanPrecede)",

This is accomplished by extracting package contents into a project's `node_modules` folder. If the `node_modules` folder of the root project or any of its dependencies is somehow replaced with a symbolic link, it could allow Arborist to write package dependencies to any arbitrary location on the file system. Note that symbolic links contained within package artifact contents are filtered out, so another means of creating a `node_modules` symbolic link would have to be employed. 1. A `preinstall` script could replace `node_modules` with a symlink. (This is prevented by using `--ignore-scripts`.) 2. An attacker could supply the target with a git repository, instructing them to run `npm install --ignore-scripts` in the root. This may be successful, because `npm install --ignore-scripts` is typically not capable of making changes outside of the project directory, so it may be deemed safe. This is patched in @npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above. For more information including workarounds please see the referenced GHSA-gmw6-94gg-2rc2.\n\n- CVE-2021-1612: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software CLI could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the local system. This vulnerability is due to improper access controls on files within the local file system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a symbolic link in a specific location on the local file system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on an affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-26089: An improper symlink following in FortiClient for Mac 6.4.3 and below may allow an non-privileged user to execute arbitrary privileged shell commands during installation phase.\n\n- CVE-2022-20720: Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOx application hosting environment on multiple Cisco platforms could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying host operating system, execute arbitrary code on the underlying host operating system, install applications without being authenticated, or conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the affected software. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2022-26612: In Apache Hadoop, The unTar function uses unTarUsingJava function on Windows and the built-in tar utility on Unix and other OSes. As a result, a TAR entry may create a symlink under the expected extraction directory which points to an external directory. A subsequent TAR entry may extract an arbitrary file into the external directory using the symlink name. This however would be caught by the same targetDirPath check on Unix because of the getCanonicalPath call. However on Windows, getCanonicalPath doesn't resolve symbolic links, which bypasses the check. unpackEntries during TAR extraction follows symbolic links which allows writing outside expected base directory on Windows. This was addressed in Apache Hadoop 3.2.3\n\n- CVE-2022-3592: A symlink following vulnerability was found in Samba, where a user can create a symbolic link that will make 'smbd' escape the configured share path. This flaw allows a remote user with access to the exported part of the file system under a share via SMB1 unix extensions or NFS to create symlinks to files outside the 'smbd' configured share path and gain access to another restricted server's filesystem.\n\n- CVE-2022-36113: Cargo is a package manager for the rust programming language. After a package is downloaded, Cargo extracts its source code in the ~/.cargo folder on disk, making it available to the Rust projects it builds. To record when an extraction is successful, Cargo writes \"ok\" to the .cargo-ok file at the root of the extracted source code once it extracted all the files. It was discovered that Cargo allowed packages to contain a .cargo-ok symbolic link, which Cargo would extract. Then, when Cargo attempted to write \"ok\" into .cargo-ok, it would actually replace the first two bytes of the file the symlink pointed to with ok. This would allow an attacker to corrupt one file on the machine using Cargo to extract the package. Note that by design Cargo allows code execution at build time, due to build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerabilities in this advisory allow performing a subset of the possible damage in a harder to track down way. Your dependencies must still be trusted if you want to be protected from attacks, as it's possible to perform the same attacks with build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerability is present in all versions of Cargo. Rust 1.64, to be released on September 22nd, will include a fix for it. Since the vulnerability is just a more limited way to accomplish what a malicious build scripts or procedural macros can do, we decided not to publish Rust point releases backporting the security fix. Patch files are available for Rust 1.63.0 are available in the wg-security-response repository for people building their own toolchain. Mitigations We recommend users of alternate registries to exercise care in which package they download, by only including trusted dependencies in their projects. Please note that even with these vulnerabilities fixed, by design Cargo allows arbitrary code execution at build time thanks to build scripts and procedural macros: a malicious dependency will be able to cause damage regardless of these vulnerabilities. crates.io implemented server-side checks to reject these kinds of packages years ago, and there are no packages on crates.io exploiting these vulnerabilities. crates.io users still need to exercise care in choosing their dependencies though, as remote code execution is allowed by design there as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24904: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with version 0.7.0 and prior to versions 2.1.15m 2.2.9, and 2.3.4 is vulnerable to a symlink following bug allowing a malicious user with repository write access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user with write access for a repository which is (or may be) used in a directory-type Application may commit a symlink which points to an out-of-bounds file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include manifest files from other Applications' source repositories (potentially decrypted files, if you are using a decryption plugin) or any JSON-formatted secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.4, 2.2.9, and 2.1.15. Users of versions 2.3.0 or above who do not have any Jsonnet/directory-type Applications may disable the Jsonnet/directory config management tool as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-35631: On MacOS and Linux, it may be possible to perform a symlink attack by replacing this predictable file name with a symlink to another file and have the Velociraptor client overwrite the other file.

All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms.

These race conditions have a variety of root causes and symptoms. Attackers may be able to exploit a signal handler race condition to cause the product state to be corrupted, possibly leading to a denial of service or even code execution.\n\n\nThese issues occur when non-reentrant functions, or state-sensitive actions occur in the signal handler, where they may be called at any time. These behaviors can violate assumptions being made by the \"regular\" code that is interrupted, or by other signal handlers that may also be invoked. If these functions are called at an inopportune moment - such as while a non-reentrant function is already running - memory corruption could occur that may be exploitable for code execution. Another signal race condition commonly found occurs when free is called within a signal handler, resulting in a double free and therefore a write-what-where condition. Even if a given pointer is set to NULL after it has been freed, a race condition still exists between the time the memory was freed and the pointer was set to NULL. This is especially problematic if the same signal handler has been set for more than one signal -- since it means that the signal handler itself may be reentered.\n\n\nThere are several known behaviors related to signal handlers that have received the label of \"signal handler race condition\":\n\n\n  - Shared state (e.g. global data or static variables) that are accessible to both a signal handler and \"regular\" code\n\n  - Shared state between a signal handler and other signal handlers\n\n  - Use of non-reentrant functionality within a signal handler - which generally implies that shared state is being used. For example, malloc() and free() are non-reentrant because they may use global or static data structures for managing memory, and they are indirectly used by innocent-seeming functions such as syslog(); these functions could be exploited for memory corruption and, possibly, code execution.\n\n  - Association of the same signal handler function with multiple signals - which might imply shared state, since the same code and resources are accessed. For example, this can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\n  - Use of setjmp and longjmp, or other mechanisms that prevent a signal handler from returning control back to the original functionality\n\n  - While not technically a race condition, some signal handlers are designed to be called at most once, and being called more than once can introduce security problems, even when there are not any concurrent calls to the signal handler. This can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\nSignal handler vulnerabilities are often classified based on the absence of a specific protection mechanism, although this style of classification is discouraged in CWE because programmers often have a choice of several different mechanisms for addressing the weakness. Such protection mechanisms may preserve exclusivity of access to the shared resource, and behavioral atomicity for the relevant code:\n\n  - Avoiding shared state\n\n  - Using synchronization in the signal handler\n\n  - Using synchronization in the regular code\n\n  - Disabling or masking other signals, which provides atomicity (which effectively ensures exclusivity)\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-362\nCanPrecede -> CWE-415\nCanPrecede -> CWE-416\nCanPrecede -> CWE-123\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis weakness can be security-relevant when an attacker can influence the state of the resource between check and use. This can happen with shared resources such as files, memory, or even variables in multithreaded programs.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nTOCTTOU: The TOCTTOU acronym expands to \"Time Of Check To Time Of Use\".\nTOCCTOU: The TOCCTOU acronym is most likely a typo of TOCTTOU, but it has been used in some influential documents, so the typo is repeated fairly frequently.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-362\nChildOf -> CWE-362\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** TOCTOU issues do not always involve symlinks, and not every symlink issue is a TOCTOU problem.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Non-symlink TOCTOU issues are not reported frequently, but they are likely to occur in code that attempts to be secure.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2015-1743:** TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed\n- **CVE-2003-0813:** A multi-threaded race condition allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or reboot) by causing two threads to process the same RPC request, which causes one thread to use memory after it has been freed.\n- **CVE-2004-0594:** PHP flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by aborting execution before the initialization of key data structures is complete.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis is often triggered by improper handling of malformed data or unexpectedly interrupted sessions. In some languages, developers are responsible for tracking memory allocation and releasing the memory.

This should not be done, as it is not guaranteed to work in all languages and on all architectures. In summary, other threads may not be operating inside the synchronous block and are not guaranteed to see the operations execute in the same order as they would appear inside the synchronous block.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-667\nCanPrecede -> CWE-367\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-828: Signal Handler with Functionality that is not Asynchronous-Safe\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product defines a signal handler that contains code sequences that are not asynchronous-safe, i.e., the functionality is not reentrant, or it can be interrupted.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis can lead to an unexpected system state with a variety of potential consequences depending on context, including denial of service and code execution.\n\n\nSignal handlers are typically intended to interrupt normal functionality of a program, or even other signals, in order to notify the process of an event. When a signal handler uses global or static variables, or invokes functions that ultimately depend on such state or its associated metadata, then it could corrupt system state that is being used by normal functionality. This could subject the program to race conditions or other weaknesses that allow an attacker to cause the program state to be corrupted. While denial of service is frequently the consequence, in some cases this weakness could be leveraged for code execution.\n\n\nThere are several different scenarios that introduce this issue:\n\n\n  - Invocation of non-reentrant functions from within the handler. One example is malloc(), which modifies internal global variables as it manages memory. Very few functions are actually reentrant.\n\n  - Code sequences (not necessarily function calls) contain non-atomic use of global variables, or associated metadata or structures, that can be accessed by other functionality of the program, including other signal handlers. Frequently, the same function is registered to handle multiple signals.\n\n  - The signal handler function is intended to run at most one time, but instead it can be invoked multiple times. This could happen by repeated delivery of the same signal, or by delivery of different signals that have the same handler function (CWE-831).\n\nNote that in some environments or contexts, it might be possible for the signal handler to be interrupted itself.\n\nIf both a signal handler and the normal behavior of the product have to operate on the same set of state variables, and a signal is received in the middle of the normal execution's modifications of those variables, the variables may be in an incorrect or corrupt state during signal handler execution, and possibly still incorrect or corrupt upon return.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-364\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2008-4109:** Signal handler uses functions that ultimately call the unsafe syslog/malloc/s*printf, leading to denial of service via multiple login attempts\n- **CVE-2006-5051:** Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n- **CVE-2001-1349:** unsafe calls to library functions from signal handler\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-459: Incomplete Cleanup\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly \"clean up\" and remove temporary or supporting resources after they have been used.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nInsufficient Cleanup\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-404\nChildOf -> CWE-404\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** CWE-459 is a child of CWE-404 because, while CWE-404 covers any type of improper shutdown or release of a resource, CWE-459 deals specifically with a multi-step shutdown process in which a crucial step for \"proper\" cleanup is omitted or impossible. That is, CWE-459 deals specifically with a cleanup or shutdown process that does not successfully remove all potentially sensitive data.\n\n**[Relationship]** Overlaps other categories such as permissions and containment. Concept needs further development. This could be primary (e.g. leading to infoleak) or resultant (e.g. resulting from unhandled error conditions or early termination).\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2000-0552:** World-readable temporary file not deleted after use.\n- **CVE-2005-2293:** Temporary file not deleted after use, leaking database usernames and passwords.\n- **CVE-2002-0788:** Interaction error creates a temporary file that can not be deleted due to strong permissions.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nA race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.\n\n\nA race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:\n\n\n  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.\n\n  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.\n\nA race condition exists when an \"interfering code sequence\" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.\n\nThe interfering code sequence could be \"trusted\" or \"untrusted.\" A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nRace Condition\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-691\nCanPrecede -> CWE-416\nCanPrecede -> CWE-476\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.\n\n**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n",

All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2009-0935: Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice\n\n- CVE-2010-4210: function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.\n\n- CVE-2008-4302: Chain: OS kernel does not properly handle a failure of a function call (CWE-755), leading to an unlock of a resource that was not locked (CWE-832), with resultant crash.\n\n- CVE-2009-1243: OS kernel performs an unlock in some incorrect circumstances, leading to panic.\n\n- CVE-2009-2857: OS deadlock\n\n- CVE-2009-1961: OS deadlock involving 3 separate functions\n\n- CVE-2009-2699: deadlock in library\n\n- CVE-2009-4272: deadlock triggered by packets that force collisions in a routing table\n\n- CVE-2002-1850: read/write deadlock between web server and script\n\n- CVE-2004-0174: web server deadlock involving multiple listening connections\n\n- CVE-2009-1388: multiple simultaneous calls to the same function trigger deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2006-5158: chain: other weakness leads to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) or deadlock (CWE-833).\n\n- CVE-2006-4342: deadlock when an operation is performed on a resource while it is being removed.\n\n- CVE-2006-2374: Deadlock in device driver triggered by using file handle of a related device.\n\n- CVE-2006-2275: Deadlock when large number of small messages cannot be processed quickly enough.\n\n- CVE-2005-3847: OS kernel has deadlock triggered by a signal during a core dump.\n\n- CVE-2005-3106: Race condition leads to deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2005-2456: Chain: array index error (CWE-129) leads to deadlock (CWE-833)\n\n- CVE-2001-0682: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a mutex.\n\n- CVE-2002-1914: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.\n\n- CVE-2002-1915: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.\n\n- CVE-2002-0051: Critical file can be opened with exclusive read access by user, preventing application of security policy.

Resultant from permissions and randomness.\n\n- CVE-2000-1198: Chain: Lock files with predictable names. Resultant from randomness.\n\n- CVE-2002-1869: Product does not check if it can write to a log file, allowing attackers to avoid logging by accessing the file using an exclusive lock. Overlaps unchecked error condition. This is not quite CWE-412, but close.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0529: In memory management driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android SoCAndroid ID: A-185195268\n\n- CVE-2021-0625: In ccu, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS05594996; Issue ID: ALPS05594996.\n\n- CVE-2020-27014: Trend Micro Antivirus for Mac 2020 (Consumer) contains a race condition vulnerability in the Web Threat Protection Blocklist component, that if exploited, could allow an attacker to case a kernel panic or crash.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAn attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: A race condition was addressed with improved locking. This issue is fixed in macOS Big Sur 11.2, Security Update 2021-001 Catalina, Security Update 2021-001 Mojave, watchOS 7.3, tvOS 14.4, iOS 14.4 and iPadOS 14.4. A malicious application may be able to elevate privileges. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited..\n\n- CVE-2021-31961: Windows InstallService Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26708: A local privilege escalation was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.10.13. Multiple race conditions in the AF_VSOCK implementation are caused by wrong locking in net/vmw_vsock/af_vsock.c. The race conditions were implicitly introduced in the commits that added VSOCK multi-transport support.\n\n- CVE-2021-0330: In add_user_ce and remove_user_ce of storaged.cpp, there is a possible use-after-free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in storaged with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-9 Android-10 Android-11Android ID: A-170732441\n\n- CVE-2021-0940: In TBD of TBD, there is a possible out of bounds write due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in the kernel with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-171315276References: N/A\n\n- CVE-2021-26312: Failure to flush the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) of the I/O memory management unit (IOMMU) may lead an IO device to write to memory it should not be able to access, resulting in a potential loss of integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-29509: Puma is a concurrent HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications. The fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris). The fix is very small and a git patch is available for those using unsupported versions of Puma.\n\n- CVE-2021-4001: A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's ebpf verifier between bpf_map_update_elem and bpf_map_freeze due to a missing lock in kernel/bpf/syscall.c. In this flaw, a local user with a special privilege (cap_sys_admin or cap_bpf) can modify the frozen mapped address space. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.16 rc2.\n\n- CVE-2021-41141: PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in the C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In various parts of PJSIP, when error/failure occurs, it is found that the function returns without releasing the currently held locks. This could result in a system deadlock, which cause a denial of service for the users. No release has yet been made which contains the linked fix commit. All versions up to an including 2.11.1 are affected. Users may need to manually apply the patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-4149: A vulnerability was found in btrfs_alloc_tree_b in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c in the Linux kernel due to an improper lock operation in btrfs. In this flaw, a user with a local privilege may cause a denial of service (DOS) due to a deadlock problem.\n\n- CVE-2022-20016: In vow driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking.

This issue is fixed in macOS Monterey 12.5, macOS Big Sur 11.6.8, Security Update 2022-005 Catalina. An app may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.\n\n- CVE-2022-39131: In camera driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local denial of service in kernel.\n\n- CVE-2022-42775: In camera driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local denial of service in kernel.\n\n- CVE-2022-26356: Racy interactions between dirty vram tracking and paging log dirty hypercalls Activation of log dirty mode done by XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram (was named HVMOP_track_dirty_vram before Xen 4.9) is racy with ongoing log dirty hypercalls. A suitably timed call to XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram can enable log dirty while another CPU is still in the process of tearing down the structures related to a previously enabled log dirty mode (XEN_DOMCTL_SHADOW_OP_OFF). This is due to lack of mutually exclusive locking between both operations and can lead to entries being added in already freed slots, resulting in a memory leak.\n\n- CVE-2021-0147: Improper locking in the Power Management Controller (PMC) for some Intel Chipset firmware before versions pmc_fw_lbg_c1-21ww02a and pmc_fw_lbg_b0-21ww02a may allow a privileged user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-39640: In __dwc3_gadget_ep0_queue of ep0.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to improper locking.

This vulnerability is due to a deadlock condition in the code when processing COPS packets under certain conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending COPS packets with high burst rates to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the CPU to consume excessive resources, which prevents other control plane processes from obtaining resources and results in a DoS.\n\n- CVE-2021-20291: A deadlock vulnerability was found in 'github.com/containers/storage' in versions before 1.28.1. When a container image is processed, each layer is unpacked using `tar`. If one of those layers is not a valid `tar` archive this causes an error leading to an unexpected situation where the code indefinitely waits for the tar unpacked stream, which never finishes. An attacker could use this vulnerability to craft a malicious image, which when downloaded and stored by an application using containers/storage, would then cause a deadlock leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n- CVE-2021-28951: An issue was discovered in fs/io_uring.c in the Linux kernel through 5.11.8. It allows attackers to cause a denial of service (deadlock) because exit may be waiting to park a SQPOLL thread, but concurrently that SQPOLL thread is waiting for a signal to start, aka CID-3ebba796fa25.\n\n- CVE-2021-31611: The Bluetooth Classic implementation on Zhuhai Jieli AC690X and AC692X devices does not properly handle an out-of-order LMP Setup procedure that is followed by a malformed LMP packet, allowing attackers in radio range to deadlock a device via a crafted LMP packet. The user needs to manually reboot the device to restore communication.\n\n- CVE-2021-31785: The Bluetooth Classic implementation on Actions ATS2815 and ATS2819 chipsets does not properly handle the reception of multiple LMP_host_connection_req packets, allowing attackers in radio range to trigger a denial of service (deadlock) of the device via crafted LMP packets. Manual user intervention is required to restart the device and restore Bluetooth communication.\n\n- CVE-2021-38203: btrfs in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (deadlock) via processes that trigger allocation of new system chunks during times when there is a shortage of free space in the system space_info.\n\n- CVE-2021-31786: The Bluetooth Classic Audio implementation on Actions ATS2815 and ATS2819 devices does not properly handle a connection attempt from a host with the same BDAddress as the current connected BT host, allowing attackers to trigger a disconnection and deadlock of the device by connecting with a forged BDAddress that matches the original connected host.\n\n- CVE-2021-3499: A vulnerability was found in OVN Kubernetes in versions up to and including 0.3.0 where the Egress Firewall does not reliably apply firewall rules when there is multiple DNS rules. It could lead to potentially lose of confidentiality, integrity or availability of a service.\n\n- CVE-2021-3735: A deadlock issue was found in the AHCI controller device of QEMU. It occurs on a software reset (ahci_reset_port) while handling a host-to-device Register FIS (Frame Information Structure) packet from the guest. A privileged user inside the guest could use this flaw to hang the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-43395: An issue was discovered in illumos before f859e7171bb5db34321e45585839c6c3200ebb90, OmniOS Community Edition r151038, OpenIndiana Hipster 2021.04, and SmartOS 20210923. A local unprivileged user can cause a deadlock and kernel panic via crafted rename and rmdir calls on tmpfs filesystems. Oracle Solaris 10 and 11 is also affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-31621: MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. In extra/mariabackup/ds_xbstream.cc, when an error occurs (stream_ctxt->dest_file == NULL) while executing the method xbstream_open, the held lock is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock. Note: The vendor argues this is just an improper locking bug and not a vulnerability with adverse effects.\n\n- CVE-2022-31622: MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. In extra/mariabackup/ds_compress.cc, when an error occurs (pthread_create returns a nonzero value) while executing the method create_worker_threads, the held lock is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock. Note: The vendor argues this is just an improper locking bug and not a vulnerability with adverse effects.\n\n- CVE-2022-31623: MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. In extra/mariabackup/ds_compress.cc, when an error occurs (i.e., going to the err label) while executing the method create_worker_threads, the held lock thd->ctrl_mutex is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock. Note: The vendor argues this is just an improper locking bug and not a vulnerability with adverse effects.\n\n- CVE-2022-31624: MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. While executing the plugin/server_audit/server_audit.c method log_statement_ex, the held lock lock_bigbuffer is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2022-38791: In MariaDB before 10.9.2, compress_write in extra/mariabackup/ds_compress.cc does not release data_mutex upon a stream write failure, which allows local users to trigger a deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2022-42328: Guests can trigger deadlock in Linux netback driver T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] The patch for XSA-392 introduced another issue which might result in a deadlock when trying to free the SKB of a packet dropped due to the XSA-392 handling (CVE-2022-42328).

        "matched_text": "CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition\n\nType: Base\n\nStatus: Incomplete\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nRace conditions frequently occur in signal handlers, since signal handlers support asynchronous actions. These race conditions have a variety of root causes and symptoms. Attackers may be able to exploit a signal handler race condition to cause the product state to be corrupted, possibly leading to a denial of service or even code execution.\n\n\nThese issues occur when non-reentrant functions, or state-sensitive actions occur in the signal handler, where they may be called at any time. These behaviors can violate assumptions being made by the \"regular\" code that is interrupted, or by other signal handlers that may also be invoked. If these functions are called at an inopportune moment - such as while a non-reentrant function is already running - memory corruption could occur that may be exploitable for code execution. Another signal race condition commonly found occurs when free is called within a signal handler, resulting in a double free and therefore a write-what-where condition. Even if a given pointer is set to NULL after it has been freed, a race condition still exists between the time the memory was freed and the pointer was set to NULL. This is especially problematic if the same signal handler has been set for more than one signal -- since it means that the signal handler itself may be reentered.\n\n\nThere are several known behaviors related to signal handlers that have received the label of \"signal handler race condition\":\n\n\n  - Shared state (e.g. global data or static variables) that are accessible to both a signal handler and \"regular\" code\n\n  - Shared state between a signal handler and other signal handlers\n\n  - Use of non-reentrant functionality within a signal handler - which generally implies that shared state is being used. For example, malloc() and free() are non-reentrant because they may use global or static data structures for managing memory, and they are indirectly used by innocent-seeming functions such as syslog(); these functions could be exploited for memory corruption and, possibly, code execution.\n\n  - Association of the same signal handler function with multiple signals - which might imply shared state, since the same code and resources are accessed. For example, this can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\n  - Use of setjmp and longjmp, or other mechanisms that prevent a signal handler from returning control back to the original functionality\n\n  - While not technically a race condition, some signal handlers are designed to be called at most once, and being called more than once can introduce security problems, even when there are not any concurrent calls to the signal handler. This can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\nSignal handler vulnerabilities are often classified based on the absence of a specific protection mechanism, although this style of classification is discouraged in CWE because programmers often have a choice of several different mechanisms for addressing the weakness. Such protection mechanisms may preserve exclusivity of access to the shared resource, and behavioral atomicity for the relevant code:\n\n  - Avoiding shared state\n\n  - Using synchronization in the signal handler\n\n  - Using synchronization in the regular code\n\n  - Disabling or masking other signals, which provides atomicity (which effectively ensures exclusivity)\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-1999-0035: Signal handler does not disable other signal handlers, allowing it to be interrupted, causing other functionality to access files/etc. with raised privileges\n\n- CVE-2001-0905: Attacker can send a signal while another signal handler is already running, leading to crash or execution with root privileges\n\n- CVE-2001-1349: unsafe calls to library functions from signal handler\n\n- CVE-2004-0794: SIGURG can be used to remotely interrupt signal handler; other variants exist\n\n- CVE-2004-2259: SIGCHLD signal to FTP server can cause crash under heavy load while executing non-reentrant functions like malloc/free.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0244: A signal handler race condition exists in the Layer 2 Address Learning Daemon (L2ALD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS due to the absence of a specific protection mechanism to avoid a race condition which may allow an attacker to bypass the storm-control feature on devices.

Linux and Mac releases of the SDK version 1.14.0 and below contain a key disclosure vulnerability that, in certain conditions, can be exploited by local attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. SDK users of the SqliteAccountInfo format are vulnerable while users of the InMemoryAccountInfo format are safe. The SqliteAccountInfo saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping) in a local database file ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info, ~/.b2_account_info or a user-defined path). When first created, the file is world readable and is (typically a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the user. If the directory containing the file is readable by a local attacker then during the brief period between file creation and permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file and maintain a handle to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents after the file after the sensitive information has been saved to it. Consumers of this SDK who rely on it to save data using SqliteAccountInfo class should upgrade to the latest version of the SDK. Those who believe a local user might have opened a handle using this race condition, should remove the affected database files and regenerate all application keys. Users should upgrade to b2-sdk-python 1.14.1 or later.\n\n- CVE-2022-23653: B2 Command Line Tool is the official command line tool for the backblaze cloud storage service. Linux and Mac releases of the B2 command-line tool version 3.2.0 and below contain a key disclosure vulnerability that, in certain conditions, can be exploited by local attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. The command line tool saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping) in a local database file (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info`, `~/.b2_account_info` or a user-defined path) when `b2 authorize-account` is first run. This happens regardless of whether a valid key is provided or not. When first created, the file is world readable and is (typically a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the user. If the directory is readable by a local attacker and the user did not yet run `b2 authorize-account` then during the brief period between file creation and permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file and maintain a handle to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents after the file after the sensitive information has been saved to it. Users that have not yet run `b2 authorize-account` should upgrade to B2 Command-Line Tool v3.2.1 before running it. Users that have run `b2 authorize-account` are safe if at the time of the file creation no other local users had read access to the local configuration file. Users that have run `b2 authorize-account` where the designated path could be opened by another local user should upgrade to B2 Command-Line Tool v3.2.1 and remove the database and regenerate all application keys. Note that `b2 clear-account` does not remove the database file and it should not be used to ensure that all open handles to the file are invalidated. If B2 Command-Line Tool cannot be upgraded to v3.2.1 due to a dependency conflict, a binary release can be used instead. Alternatively a new version could be installed within a virtualenv, or the permissions can be changed to prevent local users from opening the database file.\n\n- CVE-2022-25165: An issue was discovered in Amazon AWS VPN Client 2.0.0. A TOCTOU race condition exists during the validation of VPN configuration files. This allows parameters outside of the AWS VPN Client allow list to be injected into the configuration file prior to the AWS VPN Client service (running as SYSTEM) processing the file. Dangerous arguments can be injected by a low-level user such as log, which allows an arbitrary destination to be specified for writing log files. This leads to an arbitrary file write as SYSTEM with partial control over the files content. This can be abused to cause an elevation of privilege or denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2022-26859: Dell BIOS contains a race condition vulnerability. A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious input via SMI in order to bypass security checks during SMM.\n\n- CVE-2022-28743: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulerability in Foscam R2C IP camera running System FW <= 1.13.1.6, and Application FW <= 2.91.2.66, allows an authenticated remote attacker with administrator permissions to execute arbitrary remote code via a malicious firmware patch. The impact of this vulnerability is that the remote attacker could gain full remote access to the IP camera and the underlying Linux system with root permissions. With root access to the camera's Linux OS, an attacker could effectively change the code that is running, add backdoor access, or invade the privacy of the user by accessing the live camera stream.\n\n- CVE-2022-29800: A time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition vulnerability was found in networkd-dispatcher. This flaw exists because there is a certain time between the scripts being discovered and them being run. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to replace scripts that networkd-dispatcher believes to be owned by root with ones that are not.\n\n- CVE-2022-31466: Time of Check - Time of Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability in Quick Heal Total Security prior to 12.1.1.27 allows a local attacker to achieve privilege escalation, potentially leading to deletion of system files. This is achieved through exploiting the time between detecting a file as malicious and when the action of quarantining or cleaning is performed, and using the time to replace the malicious file by a symlink.\n\n- CVE-2022-33691: A possible race condition vulnerability in score driver prior to SMR Jul-2022 Release 1 can allow local attackers to interleave malicious operations.\n\n- CVE-2022-34830: An Arm product family through 2022-06-29 has a TOCTOU Race Condition that allows non-privileged user to make improper GPU processing operations to gain access to already freed memory.\n\n- CVE-2022-34899: This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Parallels Access 6.5.4 (39316) Agent. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target host system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the Parallels service. By creating a symbolic link, an attacker can abuse the service to execute a file. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of root.

Because of a TOCTOU race condition between the validation checks and the HTTP request, attackers can reach internal hosts that are explicitly forbidden.\n\n- CVE-2022-45842: Unauth. Race Condition vulnerability in WP ULike Plugin <= 4.6.4 on WordPress allows attackers to increase/decrease rating scores. \n\n- CVE-2022-1537: file.copy operations in GruntJS are vulnerable to a TOCTOU race condition leading to arbitrary file write in GitHub repository gruntjs/grunt prior to 1.5.3. This vulnerability is capable of arbitrary file writes which can lead to local privilege escalation to the GruntJS user if a lower-privileged user has write access to both source and destination directories as the lower-privileged user can create a symlink to the GruntJS user's .bashrc file or replace /etc/shadow file if the GruntJS user is root.\n\n- CVE-2022-21658: Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the `std::fs::remove_dir_all` standard library function is vulnerable a race condition enabling symlink following (CWE-363). An attacker could use this security issue to trick a privileged program into deleting files and directories the attacker couldn't otherwise access or delete. Rust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.58.0 is affected by this vulnerability with 1.58.1 containing a patch. Note that the following build targets don't have usable APIs to properly mitigate the attack, and are thus still vulnerable even with a patched toolchain: macOS before version 10.10 (Yosemite) and REDOX. We recommend everyone to update to Rust 1.58.1 as soon as possible, especially people developing programs expected to run in privileged contexts (including system daemons and setuid binaries), as those have the highest risk of being affected by this. Note that adding checks in your codebase before calling remove_dir_all will not mitigate the vulnerability, as they would also be vulnerable to race conditions like remove_dir_all itself. The existing mitigation is working as intended outside of race conditions.\n\n- CVE-2022-23563: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. In multiple places, TensorFlow uses `tempfile.mktemp` to create temporary files. While this is acceptable in testing, in utilities and libraries it is dangerous as a different process can create the file between the check for the filename in `mktemp` and the actual creation of the file by a subsequent operation (a TOC/TOU type of weakness). In several instances, TensorFlow was supposed to actually create a temporary directory instead of a file. This logic bug is hidden away by the `mktemp` function usage. We have patched the issue in several commits, replacing `mktemp` with the safer `mkstemp`/`mkdtemp` functions, according to the usage pattern. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-4098: Insufficient data validation in Mojo in Google Chrome prior to 96.0.4664.110 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to potentially perform a sandbox escape via a crafted HTML page.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-362 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-362 (ChildOf)",

When a signal handler uses global or static variables, or invokes functions that ultimately depend on such state or its associated metadata, then it could corrupt system state that is being used by normal functionality. This could subject the program to race conditions or other weaknesses that allow an attacker to cause the program state to be corrupted. While denial of service is frequently the consequence, in some cases this weakness could be leveraged for code execution.\n\n\nThere are several different scenarios that introduce this issue:\n\n\n  - Invocation of non-reentrant functions from within the handler. One example is malloc(), which modifies internal global variables as it manages memory. Very few functions are actually reentrant.\n\n  - Code sequences (not necessarily function calls) contain non-atomic use of global variables, or associated metadata or structures, that can be accessed by other functionality of the program, including other signal handlers. Frequently, the same function is registered to handle multiple signals.\n\n  - The signal handler function is intended to run at most one time, but instead it can be invoked multiple times. This could happen by repeated delivery of the same signal, or by delivery of different signals that have the same handler function (CWE-831).\n\nNote that in some environments or contexts, it might be possible for the signal handler to be interrupted itself.\n\nIf both a signal handler and the normal behavior of the product have to operate on the same set of state variables, and a signal is received in the middle of the normal execution's modifications of those variables, the variables may be in an incorrect or corrupt state during signal handler execution, and possibly still incorrect or corrupt upon return.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2008-4109: Signal handler uses functions that ultimately call the unsafe syslog/malloc/s*printf, leading to denial of service via multiple login attempts\n\n- CVE-2006-5051: Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n\n- CVE-2001-1349: unsafe calls to library functions from signal handler\n\n- CVE-2004-0794: SIGURG can be used to remotely interrupt signal handler; other variants exist.\n\n- CVE-2004-2259: SIGCHLD signal to FTP server can cause crash under heavy load while executing non-reentrant functions like malloc/free.\n\n- CVE-2002-1563: SIGCHLD not blocked in a daemon loop while counter is modified, causing counter to get out of sync.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-364 (ChildOf)",

A threat actor can obtain sensitive user data by decoding the tokens as JWT is signed and encoded, not encrypted.\n\n- CVE-2021-34421: The Keybase Client for Android before version 5.8.0 and the Keybase Client for iOS before version 5.8.0 fails to properly remove exploded messages initiated by a user if the receiving user places the chat session in the background while the sending user explodes the messages. This could lead to disclosure of sensitive information which was meant to be deleted from the customer's device.\n\n- CVE-2021-39327: The BulletProof Security WordPress plugin is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure due to a file path disclosure in the publicly accessible ~/db_backup_log.txt file which grants attackers the full path of the site, in addition to the path of database backup files. This affects versions up to, and including, 5.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-45330: An issue exsits in Gitea through 1.15.7, which could let a malicious user gain privileges due to client side cookies not being deleted and the session remains valid on the server side for reuse.\n\n- CVE-2021-4147: A flaw was found in the libvirt libxl driver.

In the case where an interrupt is not quiescent yet at the time this cleanup gets invoked, the cleanup attempt may be scheduled to be retried. When multiple interrupts are involved, this scheduling of a retry may get erroneously skipped. At the same time pointers may get cleared (resulting in a de-reference of NULL) and freed (resulting in a use-after-free), while other code would continue to assume them to be valid.\n\n- CVE-2022-1473: The OPENSSL_LH_flush() function, which empties a hash table, contains a bug that breaks reuse of the memory occuppied by the removed hash table entries. This function is used when decoding certificates or keys. If a long lived process periodically decodes certificates or keys its memory usage will expand without bounds and the process might be terminated by the operating system causing a denial of service. Also traversing the empty hash table entries will take increasingly more time. Typically such long lived processes might be TLS clients or TLS servers configured to accept client certificate authentication. The function was added in the OpenSSL 3.0 version thus older releases are not affected by the issue.

The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, get de-allocated when a guest switched (back) from v2 to v1. The freeing of such pages requires that the hypervisor know where in the guest these pages were mapped. The hypervisor tracks only one use within guest space, but racing requests from the guest to insert mappings of these pages may result in any of them to become mapped in multiple locations. Upon switching back from v2 to v1, the guest would then retain access to a page that was freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes.\n\n- CVE-2021-28701: Another race in XENMAPSPACE_grant_table handling Guests are permitted access to certain Xen-owned pages of memory. The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, are de-allocated when a guest switches (back) from v2 to v1. Freeing such pages requires that the hypervisor enforce that no parallel request can result in the addition of a mapping of such a page to a guest. That enforcement was missing, allowing guests to retain access to pages that were freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes. Unfortunately, when XSA-379 was being prepared, this similar issue was not noticed.\n\n- CVE-2020-11492: An issue was discovered in Docker Desktop through 2.2.0.5 on Windows.

This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j.

When restoring tensors via raw APIs, if the tensor name is not provided, TensorFlow can be tricked into dereferencing a null pointer. Alternatively, attackers can read memory outside the bounds of heap allocated data by providing some tensor names but not enough for a successful restoration. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/47a06f40411a69c99f381495f490536972152ac0/tensorflow/core/kernels/save_restore_tensor.cc#L158-L159) retrieves the tensor list corresponding to the `tensor_name` user controlled input and immediately retrieves the tensor at the restoration index (controlled via `preferred_shard` argument). This occurs without validating that the provided list has enough values. If the list is empty this results in dereferencing a null pointer (undefined behavior). If, however, the list has some elements, if the restoration index is outside the bounds this results in heap OOB read. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 9e82dce6e6bd1f36a57e08fa85af213e2b2f2622. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0.

However, this would cause confusion with \"Cascading Style Sheets,\" so usage of this acronym has declined significantly.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-25926: Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.\n\n- CVE-2021-25963: Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\n\n- CVE-2021-1879: Universal XSS in mobile operating system, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-3580: Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in firewall product leads to XSS (CWE-79), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2014-8958: Admin GUI allows XSS through cookie.\n\n- CVE-2017-9764: Web stats program allows XSS through crafted HTTP header.\n\n- CVE-2014-5198: Web log analysis product allows XSS through crafted HTTP Referer header.\n\n- CVE-2008-5080: Chain: protection mechanism failure allows XSS\n\n- CVE-2006-4308: Chain: incomplete denylist (CWE-184) only checks \"javascript:\" tag, allowing XSS (CWE-79) using other tags\n\n- CVE-2007-5727: Chain: incomplete denylist (CWE-184) only removes SCRIPT tags, enabling XSS (CWE-79)\n\n- CVE-2008-5770: Reflected XSS using the PATH_INFO in a URL\n\n- CVE-2008-4730: Reflected XSS not properly handled when generating an error message\n\n- CVE-2008-5734: Reflected XSS sent through email message.\n\n- CVE-2008-0971: Stored XSS in a security product.\n\n- CVE-2008-5249: Stored XSS using a wiki page.\n\n- CVE-2006-3568: Stored XSS in a guestbook application.\n\n- CVE-2006-3211: Stored XSS in a guestbook application using a javascript: URI in a bbcode img tag.\n\n- CVE-2006-3295: Chain: library file is not protected against a direct request (CWE-425), leading to reflected XSS (CWE-79).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-7050: Codologic Codoforum through 4.8.4 allows a DOM-based XSS. While creating a new topic as a normal user, it is possible to add a poll that is automatically loaded in the DOM once the thread/topic is opened. Because session cookies lack the HttpOnly flag, it is possible to steal authentication cookies and take over accounts.\n\n- CVE-2020-7051: Codologic Codoforum through 4.8.4 allows stored XSS in the login area. This is relevant in conjunction with CVE-2020-5842 because session cookies lack the HttpOnly flag. The impact is account takeover.\n\n- CVE-2021-1543: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an attacker to do the following: Hijack a user session Execute arbitrary commands as a root user on the underlying operating system Conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack Conduct an HTML injection attack For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-21260: Online Invoicing System (OIS) is open source software which is a lean invoicing system for small businesses, consultants and freelancers created using AppGini. In OIS version 4.0 there is a stored XSS which can enables an attacker takeover of the admin account through a payload that extracts a csrf token and sends a request to change password. It has been found that Item description is reflected without sanitization in app/items_view.php which enables the malicious scenario.\n\n- CVE-2021-21283: Flarum is an open source discussion platform for websites. The \"Flarum Sticky\" extension versions 0.1.0-beta.14 and 0.1.0-beta.15 has a cross-site scripting vulnerability. A change in release beta 14 of the Sticky extension caused the plain text content of the first post of a pinned discussion to be injected as HTML on the discussion list. The issue was discovered following an internal audit. Any HTML would be injected through the m.trust() helper. This resulted in an HTML injection where <script> tags would not be executed. However it was possible to run javascript from other HTML attributes, enabling a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack to be performed. Since the exploit only happens with the first post of a pinned discussion, an attacker would need the ability to pin their own discussion, or be able to edit a discussion that was previously pinned. On forums where all pinned posts are authored by your staff, you can be relatively certain the vulnerability has not been exploited. Forums where some user-created discussions were pinned can look at the first post edit date to find whether the vulnerability might have been exploited. Because Flarum doesn't store the post content history, you cannot be certain if a malicious edit was reverted. The fix will be available in version v0.1.0-beta.16 with Flarum beta 16. The fix has already been back-ported to Flarum beta 15 as version v0.1.0-beta.15.1 of the Sticky extension. Forum administrators can disable the Sticky extension until they are able to apply the update. The vulnerability cannot be exploited while the extension is disabled.\n\n- CVE-2021-21332: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.27.0, the password reset endpoint served via Synapse was vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The impact depends on the configuration of the domain that Synapse is deployed on, but may allow access to cookies and other browser data, CSRF vulnerabilities, and access to other resources served on the same domain or parent domains. This is fixed in version 1.27.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-22223: Client-Side code injection through Feature Flag name in GitLab CE/EE starting with 11.9 allows a specially crafted feature flag name to PUT requests on behalf of other users via clicking on a link\n\n- CVE-2021-22722: A CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Stored Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could cause code injection when importing a CSV file or changing station parameters.\n\n- CVE-2021-22723: A CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-siteScripting) through Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could allow an attacker to impersonate the user who manages the charging station or carry out actions on their behalf when crafted malicious parameters are submitted to the charging station web server.\n\n- CVE-2021-24301: The Hotjar Connecticator WordPress plugin through 1.1.1 is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the 'hotjar script' textarea. The request did include a CSRF nonce that was properly verified by the server and this vulnerability could only be exploited by administrator users.\n\n- CVE-2021-24891: The Elementor Website Builder WordPress plugin before 3.4.8 does not sanitise or escape user input appended to the DOM via a malicious hash, resulting in a DOM Cross-Site Scripting issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-25955: In \u201cDolibarr ERP CRM\u201d, WYSIWYG Editor module, v2.8.1 to v13.0.2 are affected by a stored XSS vulnerability that allows low privileged application users to store malicious scripts in the \u201cPrivate Note\u201d field at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint. These scripts are executed in a victim\u2019s browser when they open the page containing the vulnerable field. In the worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged administrator. The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account takeover of the admin and due to other vulnerability (Improper Access Control on Private notes) a low privileged user can update the private notes which could lead to privilege escalation.\n\n- CVE-2021-26929: An XSS issue was discovered in Horde Groupware Webmail Edition through 5.2.22 (where the Horde_Text_Filter library before 2.3.7 is used). The attacker can send a plain text e-mail message, with JavaScript encoded as a link or email that is mishandled by preProcess in Text2html.php, because bespoke use of \\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00 and \\\\x01\\\\x01\\\\x01 interferes with XSS defenses.\n\n- CVE-2021-29208: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29209: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29210: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29459: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. It is possible to persistently inject scripts in XWiki versions prior to 12.6.3 and 12.8. Unregistred users can fill simple text fields. Registered users can fill in their personal information and (if they have edit rights) fill the values of static lists using App Within Minutes. There is no easy workaround except upgrading XWiki. The vulnerability has been patched on XWiki 12.8 and 12.6.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32772: Poddycast is a podcast app made with Electron. Prior to version 0.8.1, an attacker can create a podcast or episode with malicious characters and execute commands on the client machine. The application does not clean the HTML characters of the podcast information obtained from the Feed, which allows the injection of HTML and JS code (cross-site scripting). Being an application made in electron, cross-site scripting can be scaled to remote code execution, making it possible to execute commands on the machine where the application is running. The vulnerability is patched in Poddycast version 0.8.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-34656: The 2Way VideoCalls and Random Chat - HTML5 Webcam Videochat WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the `vws_notice` function found in the ~/inc/requirements.php file which allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 5.2.7.\n\n- CVE-2021-34763: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an attacker to execute a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or an open redirect attack.

The value of the URL path filename is copied into the HTML document as plain text tags.\n\n- CVE-2021-3529: A flaw was found in noobaa-core in versions before 5.7.0. This flaw results in the name of an arbitrarily URL being copied into an HTML document as plain text between tags, including potentially a payload script. The input was echoed unmodified in the application response, resulting in arbitrary JavaScript being injected into an application's response. The highest threat to the system is for confidentiality, availability, and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-39186: GlobalNewFiles is a MediaWiki extension maintained by Miraheze. Prior to commit number cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d, the username column of the GlobalNewFiles special page is vulnerable to a stored XSS. Commit number cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d contains a patch. As a workaround, one may disallow <,> (or other characters required to insert html/js) from being used in account names so an XSS is not possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-37541: In JetBrains Hub before 2021.1.13402, HTML injection in the password reset email was possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-34419: In the Zoom Client for Meetings for Ubuntu Linux before version 5.1.0, there is an HTML injection flaw when sending a remote control request to a user in the process of in-meeting screen sharing.

This vulnerability allows attackers to execute phishing attacks, external redirects, and arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-39348: The LearnPress WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient escaping on the $custom_profile parameter found in the ~/inc/admin/views/backend-user-profile.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 4.1.3.1. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled. Please note that this is seperate from CVE-2021-24702.\n\n- CVE-2021-21333: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.27.0, the notification emails sent for notifications for missed messages or for an expiring account are subject to HTML injection. In the case of the notification for missed messages, this could allow an attacker to insert forged content into the email. The account expiry feature is not enabled by default and the HTML injection is not controllable by an attacker. This is fixed in version 1.27.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-42663: An HTML injection vulnerability exists in Sourcecodester Online Event Booking and Reservation System in PHP/MySQL via the msg parameter to /event-management/index.php. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability in order to change the visibility of the website. Once the target user clicks on a given link he will display the content of the HTML code of the attacker's choice.\n\n- CVE-2021-41248: GraphiQL is the reference implementation of this monorepo, GraphQL IDE, an official project under the GraphQL Foundation. All versions of graphiql older than graphiql@1.4.7 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a vulnerable schema in graphiql. There are a number of ways that can occur. By default, the schema URL is not attacker-controllable in graphiql or in its suggested implementations or examples, leaving only very complex attack vectors. If a custom implementation of graphiql's fetcher allows the schema URL to be set dynamically, such as a URL query parameter like ?endpoint= in graphql-playground, or a database provided value, then this custom graphiql implementation is vulnerable to phishing attacks, and thus much more readily available, low or no privelege level xss attacks. The URLs could look like any generic looking graphql schema URL. It should be noted that desktop clients such as Altair, Insomnia, Postwoman, do not appear to be impacted by this. This vulnerability does not impact codemirror-graphql, monaco-graphql or other dependents, as it exists in onHasCompletion.ts in graphiql. It does impact all forks of graphiql, and every released version of graphiql.\n\n- CVE-2021-41249: GraphQL Playground is a GraphQL IDE for development of graphQL focused applications. All versions of graphql-playground-react older than graphql-playground-react@1.7.28 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a malicious schema in graphql-playground. There are several ways this can occur, including by specifying the URL to a malicious schema in the endpoint query parameter. If a user clicks on a link to a GraphQL Playground installation that specifies a malicious server, arbitrary JavaScript can run in the user's browser, which can be used to exfiltrate user credentials or other harmful goals. If you are using graphql-playground-react directly in your client app, upgrade to version 1.7.28 or later.\n\n- CVE-2021-41825: Verint Workforce Optimization (WFO) 15.2.5.1033 allows HTML injection via the /wfo/control/signin username parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-42564: An open redirect through HTML injection in confidential messages in Cryptshare before 5.1.0 allows remote attackers (with permission to provide confidential messages via Cryptshare) to redirect targeted victims to any URL via the '<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\"' substring in the editor parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-43683: pictshare v1.5 is affected by a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in api/info.php. The exit function will terminate the script and print the message which has $_REQUEST['hash'].\n\n- CVE-2021-31682: The login portal for the Automated Logic WebCTRL/WebCTRL OEM web application contains a vulnerability that allows for reflected XSS attacks due to the operatorlocale GET parameter not being sanitized. This issue impacts versions 6.5 and below. This issue works by passing in a basic XSS payload to a vulnerable GET parameter that is reflected in the output without sanitization.\n\n- CVE-2021-21313: GLPI is open source software which stands for Gestionnaire Libre de Parc Informatique and it is a Free Asset and IT Management Software package. In GLPI before verison 9.5.4, there is a vulnerability in the /ajax/common.tabs.php endpoint, indeed, at least two parameters _target and id are not properly sanitized.

This can then be leveraged to execute a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack to escalate privileges to administrator.\n\n- CVE-2021-43862: jQuery Terminal Emulator is a plugin for creating command line interpreters in your applications. Versions prior to 2.31.1 contain a low impact and limited cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The code for XSS payload is always visible, but an attacker can use other techniques to hide the code the victim sees. If the application uses the `execHash` option and executes code from URL, the attacker can use this URL to execute their code. The scope is limited because the javascript attribute used is added to span tag, so no automatic execution like with `onerror` on images is possible. This issue is fixed in version 2.31.1. As a workaround, the user can use formatting that wrap whole user input and its no op. The code for this workaround is available in the GitHub Security Advisory. The fix will only work when user of the library is not using different formatters (e.g. to highlight code in different way).\n\n- CVE-2021-43961: Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager 3.36.0 allows HTML Injection.\n\n- CVE-2021-44082: textpattern 4.8.7 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) via /textpattern/index.php,Body.

Argo CD starting with 2.3.0 and prior to 2.3.6 and 2.4.5 is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript in the `/auth/callback` page in a victim's browser. This vulnerability only affects Argo CD instances which have single sign on (SSO) enabled. The exploit also assumes the attacker has 1) access to the API server's encryption key, 2) a method to add a cookie to the victim's browser, and 3) the ability to convince the victim to visit a malicious `/auth/callback` link. The vulnerability is classified as low severity because access to the API server's encryption key already grants a high level of access. Exploiting the XSS would allow the attacker to impersonate the victim, but would not grant any privileges which the attacker could not otherwise gain using the encryption key. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions 2.4.5 and 2.3.6. There is currently no known workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-3242: Code Injection in GitHub repository microweber/microweber prior to 1.3.2.\n\n- CVE-2022-32763: A cross-site scripting (xss) sanitization vulnerability bypass exists in the SanitizeHtml functionality of Lansweeper lansweeper 10.1.1.0.

The victim's encrypted password can be stolen and most likely be decrypted.\n\n- CVE-2022-45004: Gophish through 0.12.1 was discovered to contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via a crafted landing page.\n\n- CVE-2022-45411: Cross-Site Tracing occurs when a server will echo a request back via the Trace method, allowing an XSS attack to access to authorization headers and cookies inaccessible to JavaScript (such as cookies protected by HTTPOnly). To mitigate this attack, browsers placed limits on <code>fetch()</code> and XMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have implemented non-standard headers such as <code>X-Http-Method-Override</code> that override the HTTP method, and made this attack possible again. Thunderbird has applied the same mitigations to the use of this and similar headers. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.\n\n- CVE-2022-39207: Onedev is an open source, self-hosted Git Server with CI/CD and Kanban. During CI/CD builds, it is possible to save build artifacts for later retrieval. They can be accessed through OneDev's web UI after the successful run of a build. These artifact files are served by the webserver in the same context as the UI without any further restrictions. This leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when a user creates a build artifact that contains HTML. When accessing the artifact, the content is rendered by the browser, including any JavaScript that it contains. Since all cookies (except for the rememberMe one) do not set the HttpOnly flag, an attacker could steal the session of a victim and use it to impersonate them. To exploit this issue, attackers need to be able to modify the content of artifacts, which usually means they need to be able to modify a project's build spec. The exploitation requires the victim to click on an attacker's link. It can be used to elevate privileges by targeting admins of a OneDev instance. In the worst case, this can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, because admins can create Server Shell Executors and use them to run any command on the server. This issue has been patched in version 7.3.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-3033: If a Thunderbird user replied to a crafted HTML email containing a <code>meta</code> tag, with the <code>meta</code> tag having the <code>http-equiv=\"refresh\"</code> attribute, and the content attribute specifying an URL, then Thunderbird started a network request to that URL, regardless of the configuration to block remote content. In combination with certain other HTML elements and attributes in the email, it was possible to execute JavaScript code included in the message in the context of the message compose document. The JavaScript code was able to perform actions including, but probably not limited to, read and modify the contents of the message compose document, including the quoted original message, which could potentially contain the decrypted plaintext of encrypted data in the crafted email. The contents could then be transmitted to the network, either to the URL specified in the META refresh tag, or to a different URL, as the JavaScript code could modify the URL specified in the document. This bug doesn't affect users who have changed the default Message Body display setting to 'simple html' or 'plain text'. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.2.1 and Thunderbird < 91.13.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-29444: Plugin Settings Change leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Cloudways Breeze plugin <= 2.0.2 on WordPress allows users with a subscriber or higher user role to execute any of the wp_ajax_* actions in the class Breeze_Configuration which includes the ability to change any of the plugin's settings including CDN setting which could be further used for XSS attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-36176: Multiple uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerabilities in the web interface of FortiPortal before 6.0.6 may allow a single low-privileged user to induce a denial of service via multiple HTTP requests.\n\n- CVE-2021-43929: Improper neutralization of special elements in output used by a downstream component ('Injection') vulnerability in work flow management in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 7.0.1-42218-2 allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2022-2178: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Saysis Computer Starcities allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).This issue affects Starcities: before 1.1. \n\n- CVE-2022-38628: Nortek Linear eMerge E3-Series 0.32-08f, 0.32-07p, 0.32-07e, 0.32-09c, 0.32-09b, 0.32-09a, and 0.32-08e were discovered to contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability which is chained with a local session fixation.

An attacker is able to inject arbitrary `CSS` into the generated graph allowing them to change the styling of elements outside of the generated graph, and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information by using specially crafted `CSS` selectors. The following example shows how an attacker can exfiltrate the contents of an input field by bruteforcing the `value` attribute one character at a time. Whenever there is an actual match, an `http` request will be made by the browser in order to \"load\" a background image that will let an attacker know what's the value of the character. This issue may lead to `Information Disclosure` via CSS selectors and functions able to generate HTTP requests. This also allows an attacker to change the document in ways which may lead a user to perform unintended actions, such as clicking on a link, etc. This issue has been resolved in version 9.1.3.

In affected versions due to incomplete validation in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeV2`, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/84d053187cb80d975ef2b9684d4b61981bca0c41/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_op.cc#L59) has some validation but does not check that `min_range` and `max_range` both have the same non-zero number of elements. If `axis` is provided (i.e., not `-1`), then validation should check that it is a value in range for the rank of `input` tensor and then the lengths of `min_range` and `max_range` inputs match the `axis` dimension of the `input` tensor. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 6da6620efad397c85493b8f8667b821403516708. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0.

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/mkl/mkl_requantization_range_per_channel_op.cc) does not validate the dimensions of the `input` tensor. A similar issue occurs in `MklRequantizePerChannelOp`. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/mkl/mkl_requantize_per_channel_op.cc) does not perform full validation for all the input arguments.

Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-25727: Memory Corruption in modem due to improper length check while copying into memory in Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Voice & Music\n\n- CVE-2022-25793: A Stack-based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in Autodesk 3ds Max 2022, 2021, and 2020 may lead to code execution through the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer when parsing ActionScript Byte Code files.

Azure RTOS USBX implementation of host support for USB CDC ECM includes an integer underflow and a buffer overflow in the `_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function which may be potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution or denial of service. Setting mac address string descriptor length to a `0` or `1` allows an attacker to introduce an integer underflow followed (string_length) by a buffer overflow of the `cdc_ecm -> ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id` array. This may allow one to redirect the code execution flow or introduce a denial of service. The fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel).

Prior to version 0.10.2, the heap initialization methods were missing a minimum size check for the given heap size argument. This could lead to out-of-bound writes when a heap was initialized with a size smaller than `3 * size_of::<usize>` because of metadata write operations. This vulnerability impacts all the initialization functions on the `Heap` and `LockedHeap` types, including `Heap::new`, `Heap::init`, `Heap::init_from_slice`, and `LockedHeap::new`. It also affects multiple uses of the `Heap::extend` method. Version 0.10.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, ensure that the heap is only initialized with a size larger than `3 * size_of::<usize>` and that the `Heap::extend` method is only called with sizes larger than `2 * size_of::<usize>()`. Also, ensure that the total heap size is (and stays) a multiple of `2 * size_of::<usize>()`.\n\n- CVE-2022-36938: DexLoader function get_stringidx_fromdex() in Redex prior to commit 3b44c64 can load an out of bound address when loading the string index table, potentially allowing remote code execution during processing of a 3rd party Android APK file.\n\n- CVE-2021-1058: NVIDIA vGPU software contains a vulnerability in the guest kernel mode driver and vGPU plugin, in which an input data size is not validated, which may lead to tampering of data or denial of service.

During shape inference, TensorFlow can allocate a large vector based on a value from a tensor controlled by the user. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-29202: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.ragged.constant` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a denial of service by consuming all available memory. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36078: Binary provides encoding/decoding in Borsh and other formats. The vulnerability is a memory allocation vulnerability that can be exploited to allocate slices in memory with (arbitrary) excessive size value, which can either exhaust available memory or crash the whole program. When using `github.com/gagliardetto/binary` to parse unchecked (or wrong type of) data from untrusted sources of input (e.g. the blockchain) into slices, it's possible to allocate memory with excessive size. When `dec.Decode(&val)` method is used to parse data into a structure that is or contains slices of values, the length of the slice was previously read directly from the data itself without any checks on the size of it, and then a slice was allocated. This could lead to an overflow and an allocation of memory with excessive size value. Users should upgrade to `v0.7.1` or higher. A workaround is not to rely on the `dec.Decode(&val)` function to parse the data, but to use a custom `UnmarshalWithDecoder()` method that reads and checks the length of any slice.\n\n- CVE-2022-37311: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large location request parameter to the redirect servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-37312: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large request body containing a redirect URL to the deferrer servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-39294: conduit-hyper integrates a conduit application with the hyper server. Prior to version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` did not check any limit on a request's length before calling [`hyper::body::to_bytes`](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/body/fn.to_bytes.html). An attacker could send a malicious request with an abnormally large `Content-Length`, which could lead to a panic if memory allocation failed for that request. In version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` sets an internal limit of 128 MiB per request, otherwise returning status 400 (\"Bad Request\"). This crate is part of the implementation of Rust's [crates.io](https://crates.io/), but that service is not affected due to its existing cloud infrastructure, which already drops such malicious requests. Even with the new limit in place, `conduit-hyper` is not recommended for production use, nor to directly serve the public Internet.\n\n- CVE-2022-4111: Unrestricted file size limit can lead to DoS in tooljet/tooljet <1.27 by allowing a logged in attacker to upload profile pictures over 2MB. \n\n- CVE-2022-41968: Nextcloud Server is an open source personal cloud server. Prior to versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.5, calendar name lengths are not validated before writing to a database. As a result, an attacker can send unnecessary amounts of data against the database. Version 23.0.10 and 24.0.5 contain patches for the issue. No known workarounds are available.\n\n- CVE-2022-20488: In NotificationChannel of NotificationChannel.java, there is a possible failure to persist permissions settings due to resource exhaustion.

This vulnerability is due to missing length validation of certain Cisco Discovery Protocol packet header fields. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to exhaust available memory and cause the service to restart. Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability. \n\n- CVE-2022-21208: The package node-opcua before 2.74.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to a missing limitation on the number of received chunks - per single session or in total for all concurrent sessions. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending an unlimited number of huge chunks (e.g. 2GB each) without sending the Final closing chunk.\n\n- CVE-2022-29212: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, certain TFLite models that were created using TFLite model converter would crash when loaded in the TFLite interpreter. The culprit is that during quantization the scale of values could be greater than 1 but code was always assuming sub-unit scaling. Thus, since code was calling `QuantizeMultiplierSmallerThanOneExp`, the `TFLITE_CHECK_LT` assertion would trigger and abort the process. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29196: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackpropFilterV2` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate that the `filter_sizes` argument is a vector. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29200: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.LSTMBlockCell` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate the ranks of any of the arguments to this API call. This results in `CHECK`-failures when the elements of the tensor are accessed. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-789 (CanPrecede)",

This is accomplished by extracting package contents into a project's `node_modules` folder. If the `node_modules` folder of the root project or any of its dependencies is somehow replaced with a symbolic link, it could allow Arborist to write package dependencies to any arbitrary location on the file system. Note that symbolic links contained within package artifact contents are filtered out, so another means of creating a `node_modules` symbolic link would have to be employed. 1. A `preinstall` script could replace `node_modules` with a symlink. (This is prevented by using `--ignore-scripts`.) 2. An attacker could supply the target with a git repository, instructing them to run `npm install --ignore-scripts` in the root. This may be successful, because `npm install --ignore-scripts` is typically not capable of making changes outside of the project directory, so it may be deemed safe. This is patched in @npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above. For more information including workarounds please see the referenced GHSA-gmw6-94gg-2rc2.\n\n- CVE-2021-1612: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software CLI could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the local system. This vulnerability is due to improper access controls on files within the local file system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a symbolic link in a specific location on the local file system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on an affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-26089: An improper symlink following in FortiClient for Mac 6.4.3 and below may allow an non-privileged user to execute arbitrary privileged shell commands during installation phase.\n\n- CVE-2022-20720: Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOx application hosting environment on multiple Cisco platforms could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying host operating system, execute arbitrary code on the underlying host operating system, install applications without being authenticated, or conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the affected software. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2022-26612: In Apache Hadoop, The unTar function uses unTarUsingJava function on Windows and the built-in tar utility on Unix and other OSes. As a result, a TAR entry may create a symlink under the expected extraction directory which points to an external directory. A subsequent TAR entry may extract an arbitrary file into the external directory using the symlink name. This however would be caught by the same targetDirPath check on Unix because of the getCanonicalPath call. However on Windows, getCanonicalPath doesn't resolve symbolic links, which bypasses the check. unpackEntries during TAR extraction follows symbolic links which allows writing outside expected base directory on Windows. This was addressed in Apache Hadoop 3.2.3\n\n- CVE-2022-3592: A symlink following vulnerability was found in Samba, where a user can create a symbolic link that will make 'smbd' escape the configured share path. This flaw allows a remote user with access to the exported part of the file system under a share via SMB1 unix extensions or NFS to create symlinks to files outside the 'smbd' configured share path and gain access to another restricted server's filesystem.\n\n- CVE-2022-36113: Cargo is a package manager for the rust programming language. After a package is downloaded, Cargo extracts its source code in the ~/.cargo folder on disk, making it available to the Rust projects it builds. To record when an extraction is successful, Cargo writes \"ok\" to the .cargo-ok file at the root of the extracted source code once it extracted all the files. It was discovered that Cargo allowed packages to contain a .cargo-ok symbolic link, which Cargo would extract. Then, when Cargo attempted to write \"ok\" into .cargo-ok, it would actually replace the first two bytes of the file the symlink pointed to with ok. This would allow an attacker to corrupt one file on the machine using Cargo to extract the package. Note that by design Cargo allows code execution at build time, due to build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerabilities in this advisory allow performing a subset of the possible damage in a harder to track down way. Your dependencies must still be trusted if you want to be protected from attacks, as it's possible to perform the same attacks with build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerability is present in all versions of Cargo. Rust 1.64, to be released on September 22nd, will include a fix for it. Since the vulnerability is just a more limited way to accomplish what a malicious build scripts or procedural macros can do, we decided not to publish Rust point releases backporting the security fix. Patch files are available for Rust 1.63.0 are available in the wg-security-response repository for people building their own toolchain. Mitigations We recommend users of alternate registries to exercise care in which package they download, by only including trusted dependencies in their projects. Please note that even with these vulnerabilities fixed, by design Cargo allows arbitrary code execution at build time thanks to build scripts and procedural macros: a malicious dependency will be able to cause damage regardless of these vulnerabilities. crates.io implemented server-side checks to reject these kinds of packages years ago, and there are no packages on crates.io exploiting these vulnerabilities. crates.io users still need to exercise care in choosing their dependencies though, as remote code execution is allowed by design there as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24904: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with version 0.7.0 and prior to versions 2.1.15m 2.2.9, and 2.3.4 is vulnerable to a symlink following bug allowing a malicious user with repository write access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user with write access for a repository which is (or may be) used in a directory-type Application may commit a symlink which points to an out-of-bounds file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include manifest files from other Applications' source repositories (potentially decrypted files, if you are using a decryption plugin) or any JSON-formatted secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.4, 2.2.9, and 2.1.15. Users of versions 2.3.0 or above who do not have any Jsonnet/directory-type Applications may disable the Jsonnet/directory config management tool as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-35631: On MacOS and Linux, it may be possible to perform a symlink attack by replacing this predictable file name with a symlink to another file and have the Velociraptor client overwrite the other file.

          "extended_description": "\n\nRace conditions frequently occur in signal handlers, since signal handlers support asynchronous actions. These race conditions have a variety of root causes and symptoms. Attackers may be able to exploit a signal handler race condition to cause the product state to be corrupted, possibly leading to a denial of service or even code execution.\n\n\nThese issues occur when non-reentrant functions, or state-sensitive actions occur in the signal handler, where they may be called at any time. These behaviors can violate assumptions being made by the \"regular\" code that is interrupted, or by other signal handlers that may also be invoked. If these functions are called at an inopportune moment - such as while a non-reentrant function is already running - memory corruption could occur that may be exploitable for code execution. Another signal race condition commonly found occurs when free is called within a signal handler, resulting in a double free and therefore a write-what-where condition. Even if a given pointer is set to NULL after it has been freed, a race condition still exists between the time the memory was freed and the pointer was set to NULL. This is especially problematic if the same signal handler has been set for more than one signal -- since it means that the signal handler itself may be reentered.\n\n\nThere are several known behaviors related to signal handlers that have received the label of \"signal handler race condition\":\n\n\n  - Shared state (e.g. global data or static variables) that are accessible to both a signal handler and \"regular\" code\n\n  - Shared state between a signal handler and other signal handlers\n\n  - Use of non-reentrant functionality within a signal handler - which generally implies that shared state is being used. For example, malloc() and free() are non-reentrant because they may use global or static data structures for managing memory, and they are indirectly used by innocent-seeming functions such as syslog(); these functions could be exploited for memory corruption and, possibly, code execution.\n\n  - Association of the same signal handler function with multiple signals - which might imply shared state, since the same code and resources are accessed. For example, this can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\n  - Use of setjmp and longjmp, or other mechanisms that prevent a signal handler from returning control back to the original functionality\n\n  - While not technically a race condition, some signal handlers are designed to be called at most once, and being called more than once can introduce security problems, even when there are not any concurrent calls to the signal handler. This can be a source of double-free and use-after-free weaknesses.\n\nSignal handler vulnerabilities are often classified based on the absence of a specific protection mechanism, although this style of classification is discouraged in CWE because programmers often have a choice of several different mechanisms for addressing the weakness. Such protection mechanisms may preserve exclusivity of access to the shared resource, and behavioral atomicity for the relevant code:\n\n  - Avoiding shared state\n\n  - Using synchronization in the signal handler\n\n  - Using synchronization in the regular code\n\n  - Disabling or masking other signals, which provides atomicity (which effectively ensures exclusivity)\n\n",

The sharing of resources causes contention and introduces interference between differently trusted domains, which poses a security threat via a timing channel, allowing attackers to infer data that belongs to a trusted agent.
