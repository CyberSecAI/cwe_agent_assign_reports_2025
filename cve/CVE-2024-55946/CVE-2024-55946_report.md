# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-55946

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-55946

## Description

Playloom Engine is an open-source, high-performance game development engine. Engine Beta v0.0.1 has a security vulnerability related to data storage, specifically when using the collaboration features. When collaborating with another user, they may have access to personal information you have entered into the software. This poses a risk to user privacy. The maintainers of Playloom Engine have temporarily disabled the collaboration feature until a fix can be implemented. When Engine Beta v0.0.2 is released, it is expected to contain a patch addressing this issue. Users should refrain from using the collaboration feature in the meantime.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Impact:** access personal information
- **Attacker:** collaborator
- **Product:** Playloom Engine
- **Version:** Beta v0.0.1
- **Component:** collaboration features

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-359 | Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |
| CWE-922 | Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.5 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-359, which focuses on the exposure of private personal information. The secondary CWEs considered are CWE-201 and CWE-922. CWE-201 describes the insertion of sensitive data into sent data, which could lead to exposure. CWE-922 is a class-level CWE describing insecure storage of sensitive information which is a parent of more specific Base level CWEs. The relationship between these CWEs reflects a chain where insecure storage (potentially) leads to sensitive information being sent and ultimately exposed.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with potentially insecure storage of personal information, leading to the insertion of sensitive information into data sent during collaboration, which ultimately results in the exposure of private personal information to unauthorized collaborators.
  - **Root Cause:** Insecure data storage or handling
  - **Weakness:** Insertion of sensitive information into sent data
  - **Impact:** Exposure of private personal information

## Summary of Analysis
The primary assessment is based on the vulnerability description stating that when collaborating, users may have access to personal information, directly leading to **exposure of personal information**. This aligns strongly with CWE-359. The retriever results also list CWE-359 with a high score. CWE-201 is included as a secondary candidate because the vulnerability description mentions the collaborator gaining access, implying that the information is being sent to them. The graph relationships and retriever results influenced the decision to include CWE-201 as a possible contributing factor, as data is being sent to another user (**Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data**). CWE-922 is a Class level CWE and represents the insecure storage of sensitive information but lacks enough information to select a more specific Base level CWE. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, representing the direct weakness and contributing factors described in the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense
