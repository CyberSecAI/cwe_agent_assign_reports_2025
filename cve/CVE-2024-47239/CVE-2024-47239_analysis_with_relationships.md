# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 1.0 | Class | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of the vulnerability description to CWE-400. While several other CWEs were considered, none provided as direct a fit. The Class level of CWE-400 is acceptable given the evidence provided doesn't point to a more specific variant.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain consists of a single element: **uncontrolled resource consumption** leading to denial of service.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the **root cause** of the denial of service vulnerability. The vulnerability description clearly states that the issue is an "**uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability**". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by explicitly mentioning "**uncontrolled resource consumption**" as the **root cause** of the vulnerability.

The Retriever Results listed CWE-400 as the top candidate, which aligns with the vulnerability description.

Therefore, CWE-400 is selected as the primary CWE.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-400 is intended for incorrect behaviors in which the product is expected to track and restrict how many resources it consumes, but CWE-400 is often misused because it is conflated with the "technical impact" of vulnerabilities in which resource consumption occurs. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
