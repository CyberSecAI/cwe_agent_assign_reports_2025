# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2025-2203

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The core issue is the lack of proper sanitization before using a parameter in an SQL query. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis

The primary identified CWE is CWE-89.

*   CWE-89 is a Base level CWE which is the preferred level of abstraction.
*   CWE-89 belongs to the class CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection'). While CWE-74 is a parent of CWE-89, CWE-89 is more specific and directly relates to SQL Injection, making it a better fit.
*   CWE-89 has peer relationships with other injection vulnerabilities like CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection'). However, the description explicitly mentions SQL injection, making CWE-89 the appropriate choice.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain is straightforward:

1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper neutralization of special elements** in a parameter used in an SQL command (CWE-89).
2.  **Impact:** Allows admins to perform **SQL injection attacks**.

## Summary of Analysis

The analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly states that the FunnelKit WordPress plugin before version 3.10.2 does not sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement, leading to **SQL injection**.

The key phrase "does not sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement" directly indicates **improper neutralization of special elements**, which is the core of CWE-89.

The vulnerability allows admins to perform **SQL injection attacks**, which is the direct impact of CWE-89.

CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it precisely describes the vulnerability as an SQL injection due to **improper neutralization**.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

*Reason for not selecting:* Although the exploit requires a manipulated `_wpnonce` value, the core issue is the **SQL injection** itself, not the CSRF.

## CWE-1236: Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product saves user-provided information into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as a command when the file is opened by a spreadsheet product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Reason for not selecting:* This CWE relates to CSV files, not SQL databases.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Reason for not selecting:* The vulnerability involves a lack of sanitization, not necessarily the immutability of parameters.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Reason for not selecting:* While authorization might be a factor, the root cause is the **SQL injection** due to lack of sanitization.

## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g. "eval").

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Reason for not selecting:* This CWE relates to dynamic code evaluation, which is not explicitly mentioned in the description.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Reason for not selecting:* While encoding or escaping might be related, the core issue is the lack of sanitization before using the parameter in the SQL statement, making CWE-89 more appropriate.

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Reason for not selecting:* This CWE relates to file uploads, which are not relevant to the described vulnerability.

## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.

*Reason for not selecting:* While CWE-74 is a parent of CWE-89, CWE-89 is more specific to SQL injection and therefore more appropriate.

## CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Reason for not selecting:* This CWE relates to static code injection, which is not explicitly mentioned in the description.

## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense
