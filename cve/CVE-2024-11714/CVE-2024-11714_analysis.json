  "description": "The WP Job Portal A Complete Recruitment System for Company or Job Board website plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the ff parameter of the getFieldsForVisibleCombobox() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.2 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11714\n\n**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the `getFieldsForVisibleCombobox()` function within the WP Job Portal plugin. Specifically, the `ff` parameter is not properly escaped or sanitized before being used in a SQL query.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The lack of proper sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query via the `ff` parameter.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to extract sensitive data from the database.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Network:** The attack is carried out remotely over the network.\n*   **`ff` Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `ff` within the `getFieldsForVisibleCombobox()` function.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have administrator-level access or higher to the WordPress site.\n*   **Access to vulnerable function:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable function and control the `ff` parameter.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n* The vulnerable code is in `modules/fieldordering/model.php`. Specifically, line 1240 in version 2.2.3 shows the vulnerable query:\n  ```php\n  $query = \"SELECT id FROM \" . wpjobportal::$_db->prefix . \"wj_portal_fieldsordering WHERE fieldfor = $fieldfor AND (userfieldtype = 'combo') AND visible_field = '\" . esc_sql($field) . \"' \";\n  ```\n    The `$fieldfor` variable is directly included in the SQL query without any sanitization, which can lead to SQL Injection.\n*   The vulnerable code was fixed by ensuring the variable `$fieldfor` is numeric before using it in the query, as indicated by the change at line 1256:\n    ```php\n      $query = \"SELECT fieldtitle AS text ,id FROM \" . wpjobportal::$_db->prefix . \"wj_portal_fieldsordering WHERE fieldfor = \".esc_sql($fieldfor).\" AND userfieldtype = 'combo' \".$wherequeryforedit.$wherequery;\n  ```\n* The vulnerability affects WP Job Portal plugin versions up to and including 2.2.2.\n* The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.2.3.",

There are no direct parent-child or chain relationships that significantly influence the selection in this specific case. The other CWEs were considered but were less directly related to the **root cause** of **insufficient escaping** leading to **SQL injection**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient escaping** of the `ff` parameter in the `getFieldsForVisibleCombobox()` function. This leads to **SQL injection**, which allows an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the **rootcause** identified as **\"insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query\"**. This directly aligns with CWE-89, which describes **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an SQL command. The vulnerability description and CVE Reference Links Content Summary both explicitly mention SQL injection as the primary vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly addresses the **root cause** and is a **Base** level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is not a CSRF vulnerability. The issue is with **SQL injection**, not with verifying the origin of the request.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is related to external control of input, but the core issue is how that input is used in an SQL query.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is not directly related to authorization issues. The vulnerability exists because of how user-supplied input is handled in an SQL query.\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Selected:* This is the primary CWE. The description perfectly matches the vulnerability's **root cause**, where **insufficient escaping** leads to **SQL injection**.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* While related to escaping, it's more general. CWE-89 is more specific to the **SQL injection** vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is not related to file uploads.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is not an authorization bypass issue.\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is about information disclosure, but not the **root cause**.\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is about Cross-site Scripting (XSS), not SQL Injection.\n\n## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is not related to deserialization.\n\n## CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.40\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is about LDAP Injection, not SQL Injection.\n\n## CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\n\n**",

The description perfectly matches the vulnerability's **root cause**, where **insufficient escaping** leads to **SQL injection**.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* While related to escaping, it's more general. CWE-89 is more specific to the **SQL injection** vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is not related to file uploads.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is not an authorization bypass issue.\n\n## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is about information disclosure, but not the **root cause**.\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is about Cross-site Scripting (XSS), not SQL Injection.\n\n## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is not related to deserialization.\n\n## CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.40\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is about LDAP Injection, not SQL Injection.\n\n## CWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 4.33\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-471: Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID)\n\n**\n\n\n## CWE Relationship Analysis\n\nCurrent CWEs represent these abstraction levels: .\n\n\n### Vulnerability Chain Analysis\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-90:**\n- 90 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')) - ROOT\n\n\n**Chain starting from CWE-89:**\n- 89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')) - ROOT\n\n\n\n### CWE Relationship Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n```",
