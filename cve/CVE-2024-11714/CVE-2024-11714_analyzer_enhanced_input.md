## Vulnerability Description
The WP Job Portal A Complete Recruitment System for Company or Job Board website plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the ff parameter of the getFieldsForVisibleCombobox() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.2 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11714

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the `getFieldsForVisibleCombobox()` function within the WP Job Portal plugin. Specifically, the `ff` parameter is not properly escaped or sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The lack of proper sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query via the `ff` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to extract sensitive data from the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is carried out remotely over the network.
*   **`ff` Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `ff` within the `getFieldsForVisibleCombobox()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have administrator-level access or higher to the WordPress site.
*   **Access to vulnerable function:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable function and control the `ff` parameter.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerable code is in `modules/fieldordering/model.php`. Specifically, line 1240 in version 2.2.3 shows the vulnerable query:
  ```php
  $query = "SELECT id FROM " . wpjobportal::$_db->prefix . "wj_portal_fieldsordering WHERE fieldfor = $fieldfor AND (userfieldtype = 'combo') AND visible_field = '" . esc_sql($field) . "' ";
  ```
    The `$fieldfor` variable is directly included in the SQL query without any sanitization, which can lead to SQL Injection.
*   The vulnerable code was fixed by ensuring the variable `$fieldfor` is numeric before using it in the query, as indicated by the change at line 1256:
    ```php
      $query = "SELECT fieldtitle AS text ,id FROM " . wpjobportal::$_db->prefix . "wj_portal_fieldsordering WHERE fieldfor = ".esc_sql($fieldfor)." AND userfieldtype = 'combo' ".$wherequeryforedit.$wherequery;
  ```
* The vulnerability affects WP Job Portal plugin versions up to and including 2.2.2.
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.2.3.
