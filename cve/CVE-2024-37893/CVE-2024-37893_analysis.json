  "description": "Firefly III is a free and open source personal finance manager. In affected versions an **MFA bypass** in the Firefly III OAuth flow may allow malicious users to bypass the MFA-check. This allows malicious users to use password spraying to gain access to Firefly III data using passwords stolen from other sources. As OAuth applications are easily enumerable using an incrementing id, an attacker could try sign an OAuth application up to a users profile quite easily if they have created one. The attacker would also need to know the victims username and password. This problem has been patched in Firefly III v6.1.17 and up. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should Use a unique password for their Firefly III instance and store their password securely, i.e. in a password manager.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-37893:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Firefly III OAuth flow that allows multi-factor authentication (MFA) to be bypassed. Specifically, the OAuth application enumeration combined with knowledge of the victim's credentials allowed an attacker to add their application to the victim's profile and then gain access.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **MFA Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to circumvent the MFA check during the OAuth authentication process.\n- **OAuth Application Enumeration:** The vulnerability is facilitated by the ability to easily enumerate OAuth applications using incrementing IDs. This allows attackers to potentially discover and target valid OAuth applications.\n- **Password Spraying:** The MFA bypass enables attackers to leverage password spraying techniques, using stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass MFA and gain unauthorized access to a user's Firefly III account.\n- **Data Breach:** Attackers can access sensitive data stored within the compromised Firefly III instance.\n- **Account Takeover:** Malicious users can potentially fully take over a user's account.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **OAuth Flow Exploitation:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability in the OAuth flow to bypass MFA.\n- **Password Spraying:** Attackers use stolen or common passwords across multiple accounts to gain access.\n- **OAuth Application Enumeration:** Attackers can enumerate OAuth applications to identify valid targets.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Knowledge of Victim's Credentials:** The attacker must know the victim's username and password to exploit this vulnerability.\n- **Ability to Enumerate OAuth Applications:** The attacker needs the ability to enumerate OAuth applications using incremental IDs.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The provided content references password spraying and MFA bypass attacks, which are relevant to understanding the vulnerability.\n- Mitigation strategies include using unique passwords, storing passwords securely, and implementing account lockout policies, which are generally good security practices.\n- The vulnerability is fixed in Firefly III version 6.1.17 and later.",

Since the vulnerability description specifies an MFA bypass due to a flaw in the OAuth flow, CWE-305, which is a more specific case of authentication bypass where the bypass is caused by a separate primary weakness, is more appropriate than the general CWE-287. The chain relationship is not strongly evident, but one can view it as a weakness in the OAuth flow (primary weakness) leading to an MFA bypass. The abstraction levels were considered to choose the most specific and appropriate CWE.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe305[\"CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe305 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe305 primary\n    class cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain can be described as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** Flaw in the OAuth flow (primary weakness).\n2.  **Weakness:** **MFA bypass** due to the OAuth flaw.\n3.  **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Firefly III data, potentially leading to account takeover.\n\nThe **Primary CWE** is CWE-305 because the vulnerability is triggered by the **MFA bypass** due to an underlying flaw in the OAuth flow.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered several CWEs related to authentication bypass and weak authentication. However, after carefully reviewing the vulnerability description and considering the CWE relationships, it became clear that CWE-305 (Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness) is the most appropriate choice. This is because the vulnerability is not simply a case of improper authentication (CWE-287), but rather an authentication bypass that occurs due to a separate, underlying weakness in the OAuth flow.\n\nThe supporting evidence for this decision comes from the vulnerability description, which states: \"an **MFA bypass** in the Firefly III OAuth flow may allow malicious users to bypass the MFA-check\". This indicates that the MFA mechanism itself is not directly flawed, but rather bypassed due to a weakness in the OAuth flow, fitting the description of CWE-305.\n\nThe relationship analysis further supports this decision, as CWE-305 is a child of CWE-287, representing a more specific case of improper authentication. By choosing CWE-305, we are providing a more accurate and detailed classification of the vulnerability.\n\nThe retriever results suggested other CWEs such as CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication), CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), and CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function). While these CWEs are related to authentication issues, they do not accurately capture the specific nature of the MFA bypass due to a primary weakness in the OAuth flow. Therefore, they were not selected.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303:
