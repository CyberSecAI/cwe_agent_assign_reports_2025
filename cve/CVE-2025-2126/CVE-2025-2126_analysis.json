  "description": "A vulnerability was found in JoomlaUX JUX Real Estate 3.4.0 on Joomla and classified as critical. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /extensions/realestate/index.php/properties/list/list-with-sidebar/realties of the component GET Parameter Handler. The manipulation of the argument title leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

While other CWEs like CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] might be present due to a general lack of input sanitization, the core issue highlighted in the description is specifically related to SQL queries. The abstraction level influenced the selection, favoring the Base level for greater specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe89 -->|PEEROF| cwe79\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper** handling of the `title` GET parameter. This leads to the construction of a malicious SQL query, which then results in **SQL Injection**.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Improper** input handling of the `title` parameter within the GET request.\n  - **Weakness:** **SQL Injection** vulnerability due to the lack of proper neutralization.\n  - **Impact:** Unauthorized database access, data leakage, or modification.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary vulnerability is **SQL Injection** (CWE-89), stemming from the **improper** handling of the `title` GET parameter in the JoomlaUX JUX Real Estate component. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**sql injection**\" as the weakness, leading to the selection of CWE-89 as the primary CWE. Other CWEs, such as CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')], were considered but deemed less relevant as the description focuses on the **SQL Injection** aspect. The decision is based on direct evidence from the vulnerability description and aligns with the recommended usage of the Base level of abstraction for root cause analysis.\n\nCWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] was considered because **improper** neutralization of input is a general problem and could exist in the application. However, the explicit mention of **SQL Injection** makes CWE-89 a more precise and relevant classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
