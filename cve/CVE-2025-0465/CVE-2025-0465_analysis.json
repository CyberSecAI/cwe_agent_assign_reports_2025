  "description": "A vulnerability was found in AquilaCMS 1.412.13. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /api/v2/categories. The manipulation of the argument PostBody.populate leads to **deserialization**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
