However, without more information, it is hard to pinpoint the exact exceptional condition that was not properly handled.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe755[\"CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe755 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with the `run_tool` command allowing the `main` function of any class under the `water.tools` namespace to be called. Then, `MojoConvertTool` is invoked with an **invalid argument**, which leads to the server crashing, resulting in a denial of service. The **improper handling** of the **exceptional condition** caused by the **invalid argument** is the weakness.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe description states that an **invalid argument** passed to `MojoConvertTool` causes the server to crash, leading to a denial of service. This indicates that the application is not properly handling the **exceptional condition** caused by the **invalid argument**. While other CWEs like CWE-400 (Resource Exhaustion) might seem applicable due to the denial of service impact, the root cause is the **improper handling** of the **exceptional condition**.\n\nI considered CWE-755 (Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions) because the vulnerability description indicates the server crashes due to an **invalid argument**, which is an **exceptional condition**. Without more information, I cannot pinpoint the exact nature of the **exceptional condition**. The retriever results did not have a good match, and this one was not present in the retriever results. I am selecting CWE-755 because it is most applicable to the **improper handling** of the **exceptional condition**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.64\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-407: Inefficient Algorithmic Complexity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.63\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nAn algorithm in a product has an inefficient worst-case computational complexity that may be detrimental to system performance and can be triggered by an attacker, typically using crafted manipulations that ensure that the worst case is being reached.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.63\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.63\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.62\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.62\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
