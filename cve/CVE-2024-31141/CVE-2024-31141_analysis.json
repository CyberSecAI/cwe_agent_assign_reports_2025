  "description": "Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties, **Improper Privilege Management** vulnerability in Apache Kafka Clients. Apache Kafka Clients accept configuration data for customizing behavior, and includes ConfigProvider plugins in order to manipulate these configurations. Apache Kafka also provides FileConfigProvider, DirectoryConfigProvider, and EnvVarConfigProvider implementations which include the ability to read from disk or environment variables. In applications where Apache Kafka Clients configurations can be specified by an untrusted party, attackers may use these ConfigProviders to read arbitrary contents of the disk and environment variables. In particular, this flaw may be used in Apache Kafka Connect to escalate from REST API access to filesystem/environment access, which may be undesirable in certain environments, including SaaS products. This issue affects Apache Kafka Clients from 2.3.0 through 3.5.2, 3.6.2, 3.7.0. Users with affected applications are recommended to upgrade kafka-clients to version >=3.8.0, and set the JVM system property org.apache.kafka.automatic.config.providers=none. Users of Kafka Connect with one of the listed ConfigProvider implementations specified in their worker config are also recommended to add appropriate allowlist.pattern and allowed.paths to restrict their operation to appropriate bounds. For users of Kafka Clients or Kafka Connect in environments that trust users with disk and environment variable access, it is not recommended to set the system property. For users of the Kafka Broker, Kafka MirrorMaker 2.0, Kafka Streams, and Kafka command-line tools, it is not recommended to set the system property.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-31141:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from the way Apache Kafka Clients handle configuration data through ConfigProvider plugins. Specifically, `FileConfigProvider`, `DirectoryConfigProvider`, and `EnvVarConfigProvider` allow reading from disk and environment variables.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Improper Privilege Management:** The core issue is the lack of proper access control when using the aforementioned ConfigProviders. If configuration is specified by an untrusted party, they can potentially use these providers to access arbitrary files and environment variables.\n*   **Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties:** Due to improper privilege management, unauthorized users can use the vulnerable components to read file system or environment variable content.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can escalate their access from a limited REST API access (like in Kafka Connect) to complete file system and environment variable access on the server.\n*   **Data Leakage:** Sensitive information stored in files or environment variables may be exposed.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Configuration Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious configurations by manipulating settings for Kafka Clients that can be controlled by an untrusted user, such as in a Kafka Connect REST API.\n*   **ConfigProvider Exploitation:** By specifying malicious `FileConfigProvider`, `DirectoryConfigProvider`, or `EnvVarConfigProvider` configurations, they can force the application to read arbitrary files or environment variables.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Ability to modify Kafka Client configurations:** Attackers need to be in a position where they can control the configurations used by Apache Kafka Clients in the application. This could be through access to a REST API or other means of specifying configuration data.\n*   **Untrusted Environment:** The attack is most effective when the attacker can influence configurations used by Kafka Client components deployed in an untrusted environment (such as in a SaaS product).\n\n**Affected Versions:**\n\n*   Apache Kafka Clients 2.3.0 through 3.5.2\n*   Apache Kafka Clients 3.6.0 through 3.6.2\n*   Apache Kafka Clients 3.7.0 through 3.7.1\n\n**Mitigation:**\n\n*   **Upgrade:** Upgrade `kafka-clients` to version 3.8.0 or later.\n*   **Disable automatic ConfigProviders:** Set the JVM system property `org.apache.kafka.automatic.config.providers=none`.\n*   **Restrict Access:** When using the affected ConfigProviders in Kafka Connect, configure `allowlist.pattern` and `allowed.paths` to restrict access to only necessary resources.\n\n**Note:** The vulnerability primarily affects scenarios where untrusted users can specify configurations for Kafka Clients. It is not recommended to disable automatic config providers for broker, MirrorMaker 2.0, Kafka Streams, or the command-line tools.",

While less specific than some Base or Variant level CWEs, it accurately reflects the **improper privilege management** at the core of this vulnerability. CWE-863 and CWE-668 are related, but less directly relevant. CWE-863 focuses on authorization, while this vulnerability is more about broader privilege management. CWE-668 describes exposing resources to the wrong sphere, which is an impact, but not the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|PEEROF| cwe269\n    cwe668 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe269\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe269 primary\n    class cwe863,cwe668 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper privilege management** (CWE-269), which allows an untrusted party to specify configurations. This leads to the ability to read arbitrary contents of the disk and environment variables, resulting in exposure of resources to the wrong sphere (CWE-668) and potentially sensitive data leakage.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nBased on the provided information, the primary weakness is **improper privilege management** (CWE-269) in Apache Kafka Clients. The vulnerability allows untrusted parties to specify configurations that can read arbitrary files and environment variables, leading to privilege escalation and data leakage.\n\nThe evidence supporting this classification includes:\n\n*   The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**Improper Privilege Management** vulnerability in Apache Kafka Clients.\"\n*   The CVE Reference Links Content Summary highlights \"**Improper Privilege Management:** The core issue is the lack of proper access control\".\n*   The mitigation strategy involves restricting access using allowlists, which is a form of privilege management.\n\nWhile CWE-269 is a Class-level CWE and is generally discouraged, the specifics of the vulnerability directly align with the description of **improperly managing privileges** related to configuration data. CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) were considered, but they describe consequences and related authorization flaws rather than the root cause of **improper privilege management**.\n\nThe retriever results suggested CWE-269 with a score of 1.168. While the retriever also suggested CWE-863 and CWE-668, these are more related to impact than root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
