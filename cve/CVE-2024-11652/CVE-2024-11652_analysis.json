  "description": "A vulnerability was found in EnGenius ENH1350EXT, ENS500-AC and ENS620EXT up to 20241118. It has been declared as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file /admin/sn_package/sn_https. The manipulation of the argument https_enable leads to **command injection**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the command injection vulnerability:\n\n*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `https_enable` parameter within the `/admin/sn_package/sn_https` interface of ENGENIUS router firmware. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.\n\n*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n    *   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection, where user-supplied input is directly used in a system command without proper validation or sanitization.\n\n*  **Impact of Exploitation:**\n    *   **System Access:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the web server, potentially gaining full control of the device.\n\n*   **Attack Vectors:**\n    *   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=<token>/admin/sn_package/sn_https` endpoint.\n    *   **Parameter Injection:** The `https_enable` parameter in the GET request is used to inject the command.\n\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n    *   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be logged in to the device as an authenticated user to access the vulnerable interface.\n    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device's web interface.\n\n**Additional details:**\n* The content provides a specific proof-of-concept (PoC) using a `ping` command injected into the `https_enable` parameter to demonstrate the vulnerability.\n* The affected devices and firmware versions are listed, suggesting a wide range of vulnerable products.\n* The vulnerability is located within a Lua script, which requires reverse engineering of the bytecode to identify the vulnerable code section.",
