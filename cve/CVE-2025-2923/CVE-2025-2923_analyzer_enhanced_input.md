## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, has been found in HDF5 up to 1.14.6. Affected by this issue is the function H5F_addr_encode_len of the file src/H5Fint.c. The manipulation of the argument pp leads to **heap-based buffer overflow**. Attacking locally is a requirement. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap-based buffer overflow**
- **product:** HDF5
- **version:** up to 1.14.6
- **component:** H5F_addr_encode_len of the file src/H5Fint.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-2923 (PLACEHOLDER) based on provided content

The provided content details a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the HDF5 library (hdf5 v1.14.6). While the CVE description is a placeholder, the content clearly relates to a security vulnerability within HDF5. This analysis extracts the relevant information.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing buffer boundary check in the `H5F_addr_encode_len` function (located in `src/H5Fint.c` at line 2959). The function writes bytes to memory without verifying if the write operation stays within the allocated buffer's boundaries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The absence of a boundary check before writing to the buffer is a critical flaw.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Application Crash:** The overflow leads to a segmentation fault and potential application crash.
*   **Potential for Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, a heap buffer overflow can potentially be exploited for code execution, depending on the surrounding memory layout and other factors.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when processing specific HDF5 files. A crafted file can trigger the overflow.
*   The provided PoC demonstrates a method to reproduce the crash using a specific file (`H5F_addr_encode_len-hbo.zip`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious HDF5 file to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker does not require elevated privileges to provide the file, but exploiting the overflow for code execution might require further exploitation techniques.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The issue requires a fix in the `H5F_addr_encode_len` function to include a buffer boundary check before writing to the buffer.
*   The issue is labeled as a "Blocker" for the Release 2.0.0, indicating a high priority for fixing.

**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**

*   The content provides the exact file and line number where the vulnerability exists (`src/H5Fint.c:2959`).
*   It includes a detailed explanation of the root cause, including the relevant code snippet.
*   A PoC is provided, including instructions on how to build the vulnerable library and trigger the crash.
*   AddressSanitizer (ASan) reports are included, providing detailed information about the memory corruption.
*   The content details the build environment and flags used to reproduce the issue.
