This is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization). CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is considered a secondary candidate because **fault injection** can lead to memory corruption. It is a base-level weakness, and a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1256[\"CWE-1256: Improper Restriction of Software Interfaces to Hardware Features\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe1256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1256 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **fault injection**, specifically Rowhammer, targeting the ed25519_key structure. The primary weakness is **improper restriction of software interfaces to hardware features** (CWE-1256), allowing the attacker to manipulate hardware behavior. The potential impact is an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787), leading to information disclosure and privilege escalation.\nRoot Cause: **Fault Injection** leading to **Improper Restriction of Software Interfaces to Hardware Features** (CWE-1256)\nImpact: Potential **Out-of-bounds Write** (CWE-787), information disclosure, and privilege escalation\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates that a **fault injection** attack, specifically Rowhammer, is used to target the ed25519_key structure in WolfSSL. Based on the description, the primary weakness is the **improper restriction of software interfaces to hardware features** (CWE-1256). This allows an attacker to manipulate the hardware via software interfaces. A secondary potential issue arising from this is **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787) due to memory corruption.\n\nThe evidence is primarily based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions **fault injection** as the root cause and its impact on information disclosure and privilege escalation. The retriever results support the selection of CWE-1256.\n\nCWE-1256 aligns well with the description because it addresses vulnerabilities that arise from inadequate restrictions on how software interacts with hardware. The description indicates that the attacker exploits a **fault injection** technique to manipulate hardware, which then leads to security breaches.\n\nCWE-787 is considered a secondary candidate because the **fault injection** could lead to memory corruption.\n\nThe CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the nature of the vulnerability. CWE-1256 captures the root cause related to hardware interaction, while CWE-787 represents a potential impact.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1256: Improper Restriction of Software Interfaces to Hardware Features\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.47\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-1256: Improper Restriction of Software Interfaces to Hardware Features\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-285\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-1256\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 3.89\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-825\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-824\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-823\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-822\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-124",
