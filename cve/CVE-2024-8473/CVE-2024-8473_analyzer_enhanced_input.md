## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-8473:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue caused by insufficient sanitization or encoding of user-controlled input. Specifically, the `user_email` parameter in the `/jobportal/admin/login.php` is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input before displaying it on a web page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially retrieve the session details of an authenticated user. This could lead to unauthorized access to the application, data theft, or other malicious activities, depending on the attacker's objectives and the application's functionalities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted request to the `/jobportal/admin/login.php` page, specifically targeting the `user_email` parameter. The attacker needs to inject malicious JavaScript code within this parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable login page. User interaction is required to trigger the execution of the malicious script, which is the typical behavior of a reflected XSS attack. This implies that the attacker would need to trick a user to visit a malicious crafted link or webpage.
