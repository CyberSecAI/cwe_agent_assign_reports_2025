  "description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to read any file in the file system of the underlying Linux operating system. The attacker must have valid credentials on the affected device. This vulnerability is due to **incorrect validation of the arguments** that are passed to a specific CLI command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to an affected device with low-privileged credentials and using the affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker access files in read-only mode on the Linux file system.",

Specifically, the vulnerability allows an authenticated local user to read arbitrary files on the underlying Linux OS.\n- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain read-only access to any file on the Linux filesystem. This can lead to information disclosure.\n- **Attack vectors**: Local access via the CLI interface on Cisco IOS XR devices.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs valid low-privileged credentials to log in to the affected device.",

The **incorrect validation of the arguments** is the root cause.|\n| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate. May occur if arguments are file paths. |\n| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.5 | Pillar | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate. The **incorrect validation of the arguments** could lead to unauthorized access. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-20 Improper Input Validation because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions **incorrect validation of the arguments** as the root cause. CWE-20 is a class-level CWE, and while it's generally better to choose a base or variant level CWE, in this case, the description doesn't provide sufficient detail to pinpoint a more specific type of input validation error. CWE-20 can precede CWE-22, meaning that if the input validation issue involves a file path, it could lead to a Path Traversal vulnerability. CWE-284 is a high-level Pillar, representing a general failure to restrict access to resources. While the vulnerability does result in unauthorized file access, it is a consequence of the input validation error (CWE-20).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe22\n    cwe22 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe22,cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect validation of the arguments** (CWE-20). If the arguments are file paths, this could lead to a Path Traversal vulnerability (CWE-22), where an attacker can access files outside the intended directory. The final impact is **read any file**, which represents a form of Improper Access Control (CWE-284) because the attacker gains unauthorized access to the file system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) because the vulnerability description states that the root cause is **incorrect validation of the arguments**. While CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) might seem applicable due to the attacker gaining unauthorized file access, it is a consequence of the input validation error, not the root cause. CWE-22 (Path Traversal) is a possibility if the **incorrect validation of the arguments** involves file paths.\n\nThe assessment is based on the provided evidence, specifically the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section which highlights the \"incorrect validation of the arguments\" as the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
