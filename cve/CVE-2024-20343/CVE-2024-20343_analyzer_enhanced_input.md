## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to read any file in the file system of the underlying Linux operating system. The attacker must have valid credentials on the affected device. This vulnerability is due to **incorrect validation of the arguments** that are passed to a specific CLI command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to an affected device with low-privileged credentials and using the affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker access files in read-only mode on the Linux file system.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **incorrect validation of the arguments**
- **impact:** read any file
- **attacker:** authenticated local attacker
- **product:** Cisco IOS XR Software
- **component:** CLI

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect validation of arguments passed to a specific CLI command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control, allowing an attacker to bypass intended restrictions on file access. Specifically, the vulnerability allows an authenticated local user to read arbitrary files on the underlying Linux OS.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain read-only access to any file on the Linux filesystem. This can lead to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access via the CLI interface on Cisco IOS XR devices.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs valid low-privileged credentials to log in to the affected device.
