The attacker must have valid credentials on the affected device. This vulnerability is due to incorrect validation of the arguments that are passed to a specific CLI command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to an affected device with low-privileged credentials and using the affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker access files in read-only mode on the Linux file system. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-22 CWE-269 CWE-250 CWE-78 CWE-20 CWE-284 CWE-668",
