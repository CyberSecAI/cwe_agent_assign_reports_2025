  "description": "Netatalk before 3.2.1 has an **off-by-one error**, and resultant **heap-based buffer overflow** and segmentation violation, because of incorrectly using FPLoginExt in BN_bin2bn in etc/uams/uams_dhx_pam.c. The original issue 1097 report stated The latest version of Netatalk (v3.2.0) contains a security vulnerability. This vulnerability arises due to a **lack of validation** for the length field after parsing user-provided data, leading to an out-of-bounds heap write of one byte (\\0). Under specific configurations, this can result in reading metadata of the next heap block, potentially causing a Denial of Service (DoS) under certain heap layouts or with ASAN enabled. ... The vulnerability is located in the FPLoginExt operation of Netatalk, in the BN_bin2bn function found in /etc/uams/uams_dhx_pam.c ... if (!(bn = BN_bin2bn((unsigned char *)ibuf, KEYSIZE, NULL))) ... threads ...

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-38440:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a lack of validation of the length field after parsing user-provided data in the `uams_dhx_pam.c` file. Specifically, the `pam_login_ext` function does not properly validate the length of the username provided in the input buffer.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Heap out-of-bounds write: The lack of length validation allows a crafted input to write a null byte (`\\0`) beyond the allocated buffer.\n- Input validation failure:  The code fails to validate the length of the user-provided username.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Denial of Service (DoS): Under specific configurations, particularly with ASAN enabled or specific heap layouts, the out-of-bounds write can overwrite heap metadata. This can lead to a crash and thus a denial of service.\n- Potential for information leak: Overwriting heap metadata could potentially reveal information about the next heap block.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Network: The vulnerability is triggered through network requests to the Netatalk service.\n- Specifically, it occurs during the authentication process using the `uams_dhx.so` module, particularly in the `FPLoginExt` operation.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to send a specially crafted authentication request to the Netatalk server.\n- The attacker does not need prior authentication or any special privileges.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- The vulnerability is located in the `BN_bin2bn` function call within `uams_dhx_pam.c`, specifically within the `pam_login_ext` function.\n- The vulnerability was introduced in Netatalk version 1.5.0.\n- The vulnerability affects Netatalk versions prior to 3.2.1, as well as older versions such as 3.0.0 - 3.1.18 and 1.5.0 - 2.4.0.\n- A patch is available with git hash `77b5d99`.\n- Upgrading to Netatalk versions 2.4.1, 3.1.19, and 3.2.1 resolves this vulnerability.\n- A workaround is to disable the `uams_dhx.so` authentication module in the `afp.conf` configuration file.\n\nThe provided content contains a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, its location, how it can be triggered, its impact, and how to fix it, providing more detail than the standard CVE description.",

CWE-193 **Off-by-one Error** can precede CWE-122 **Heap-based Buffer Overflow**. The vulnerability description explicitly states an **off-by-one error** that leads to a **heap-based buffer overflow**, making this relationship highly relevant. The abstraction levels were also considered, with both selected CWEs being at the Base level, which is preferred.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe193[\"CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\"]\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe193 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe122\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe193 primary\n    class cwe122 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-193 Off-by-one Error**, which then leads to **CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow**, and finally results in a Denial of Service (DoS) and segmentation violation.\n\n*   **CWE-193 Off-by-one Error**: Root cause due to incorrect calculation.\n*   **CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow**: Result of the **off-by-one error**, leading to memory corruption.\n*   Denial of Service and segmentation violation: Impact of the buffer overflow.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting weaknesses based on the provided description. The vulnerability description clearly indicates an **off-by-one error** leading to a **heap-based buffer overflow**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-193 and CWE-122 is strongly supported by the evidence in the vulnerability description: \"Netatalk before 3.2.1 has an **off-by-one error**, and resultant **heap-based buffer overflow**...\". This direct quote highlights the relationship between the two weaknesses. The retriever results also showed high scores for both CWEs in relation to the keyphrases \"off-by-one error\" and \"heap-based buffer overflow\".\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the specific types of errors present in the vulnerability.
