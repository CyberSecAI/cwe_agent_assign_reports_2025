  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-4995:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe root cause is the lack of encryption of sensitive data during communication between the Wapro ERP Desktop client and the MS SQL server. The application client accepts a downgrade request from the server to use an unencrypted protocol.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data (CWE-311):** The application allows communication using an unencrypted protocol, even if the client is configured for encryption.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- An attacker can intercept and modify the communication between the client and the server. This can lead to:\n  - **Data Breaches:**  Sensitive data transmitted during the communication can be read by the attacker.\n  - **Data Manipulation:**  The attacker can alter the data being transmitted.\n  - **Loss of Integrity:**  The attacker can modify financial or other business-related information.\n  - **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:**  An attacker can intercept, alter, or inject communications between the client and server.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- **Network-based attack:** An attacker positioned on the network between the Wapro ERP Desktop client and the MS SQL server can intercept the communication. This can be achieved through a man-in-the-middle attack.\n- The attacker can send a downgrade request from a compromised server to force the client into using an insecure, unencrypted communication channel.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the client and the server, which can be achieved by being on the same network or having compromised a device on the network path.\n- **Ability to intercept and modify network traffic:** The attacker must be capable of performing a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept and modify network communications, including sending protocol downgrade requests to the client.",

CWE-319 is a consequence of this vulnerability, where sensitive information is transmitted in cleartext. CWE-757 is a base level CWE, providing a good level of specificity.
