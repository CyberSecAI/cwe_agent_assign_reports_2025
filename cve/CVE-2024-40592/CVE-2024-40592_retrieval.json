Specifically, there is a race condition where an attacker can replace the genuine installer with a malicious one before the signature check takes place.\\n\\n**Weakness/Vulnerability:**\\n*   **CWE-347:** Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\\n\\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\\n*   Successful exploitation allows a local authenticated attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands on the affected system by installing a malicious package.\\n\\n**Attack Vectors:**\\n*   A local attacker needs to have authenticated access to the system.\\n*   The attacker exploits a race condition during the installation process.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n*   Local authenticated access to the target MacOS system.\\n*   Ability to manipulate files in the target system's file system during the installation process to exploit the race condition.\\n\\n**Affected Versions:**\\n*   FortiClientMac 7.4.0\\n*   FortiClientMac 7.2.0 through 7.2.4\\n*   FortiClientMac 7.0.0 through 7.0.10\\n*   FortiClientMac 6.4 all versions\\n\\n**Mitigation:**\\n*   Upgrade to FortiClientMac 7.4.1 or above\\n*   Upgrade to FortiClientMac 7.2.5 or above\\n*   Migrate to a fixed release for FortiClientMac 7.0 and 6.4 versions.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n*   The vulnerability was reported by Mykola Grymalyuk from RIPEDA Consulting.\\n*   The severity is rated as Medium with a CVSSv3 score of 6.8 (AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:X/RC:R)\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [],
