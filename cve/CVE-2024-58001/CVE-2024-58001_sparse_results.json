  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ocfs2 handle a symlink read error correctly Patch series Convert ocfs2 to use folios. Mark did a conversion of ocfs2 to use folios and sent it to me as a giant patch for review -) So Ive redone it as individual patches, and credited Mark for the patches where his code is substantially the same. Its not a bad way to do it his patch had some bugs and my patches had some bugs. Hopefully all our bugs were different from each other. And hopefully Mark likes all the changes I made to his code! This patch (of 23) If we cant read the buffer, be sure to unlock the page before returning.",
