  "description": "A vulnerability was found in aizuda snail-job 1.4.0. It has been classified as critical. Affected is the function getRuntime of the file /snail-job/workflow/check-node-expression of the component Workflow-Task Management Module. The manipulation of the argument nodeExpression leads to **deserialization**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "```\nRoot cause of vulnerability:\nThe application is vulnerable to SpEL (Spring Expression Language) injection, leading to RCE (Remote Code Execution) due to the use of an unfiltered `StandardEvaluationContext`. The vulnerability exists in the `snail-job` application.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n- SpEL injection vulnerability\n- Lack of input filtering in the expression evaluation process\n- Use of `StandardEvaluationContext`, which supports the full SpEL syntax, including potentially dangerous operations like calling system commands.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\nSuccessful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the application server. The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates this by executing the \"calc\" command.\n\nAttack vectors:\nThe attack vector involves injecting a malicious SpEL expression into the \"nodeExpression\" field when creating or updating a decision node within the workflow/task management functionality. The PoC provides the exact HTTP request with the malicious payload.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\nAn attacker needs the ability to interact with the \"snail-job\" application, specifically the workflow/task management functionality, and the ability to send a crafted HTTP request with a malicious SpEL expression. The attacker also needs valid authentication credentials.\n\nMitigation or fix:\nThe recommended fix is to replace `StandardEvaluationContext` with `SimpleEvaluationContext` in the `SpELExpressionEngine.java` file.  `SimpleEvaluationContext` supports a subset of SpEL syntax and does not include Java type references, constructors, and bean references.\n```",
