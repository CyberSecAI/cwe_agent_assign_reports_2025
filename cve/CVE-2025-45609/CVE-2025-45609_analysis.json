  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-45609 Content\n\nBased on the provided content, this relates to an **Incorrect Access Control** vulnerability in the `kob` project.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from using `request.getRequestURI()` to obtain the request path without proper sanitization or validation. This allows attackers to manipulate the path using directory traversal sequences like `/static/../` to bypass access controls.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Incorrect Access Control:** Sensitive API endpoints are accessible without proper authentication.\n*   **Directory Traversal:** The application is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks due to the improper handling of request paths.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAn attacker can bypass authentication and access sensitive information, such as data from any user, by crafting malicious requests. In the example provided, the attacker can access `/node/server_node_list.json` without authorization.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Crafting HTTP requests with directory traversal sequences in the URL (e.g., `/static/../node/server_node_list.json`).\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not explicitly state a fix, but it implies that proper input validation and sanitization of the request path are necessary to prevent directory traversal and enforce access controls.  Specifically, avoid using `request.getRequestURI()` directly and implement robust path validation.\n\n**More detail than official CVE description:**\n\nYes, the content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It includes:\n\n*   Specific affected code (`com.ke.schedule.server.console.configuration.OperationFilter`, `doFilter` function).\n*   A detailed explanation of how the vulnerability works.\n*   A concrete example of a malicious request.\n*   Screenshots demonstrating the vulnerability.\n*   Version and branch information (latest, 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT, master).",

The initial assessment leaned towards more specific children like CWE-862 or CWE-863 due to the **incorrect access control** root cause. However, the additional detail from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary revealed a directory traversal aspect, suggesting CWE-22. The evidence supports that a crafted payload can be used to bypass access controls, leading to sensitive information exposure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe22 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe22 secondary\n    class cwe862,cwe863 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **incorrect access control** in the `doFilter` function (CWE-284). The use of `request.getRequestURI()` without proper sanitization allows for directory traversal (CWE-22), which bypasses access controls and leads to the exposure of sensitive information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **incorrect access control** as the primary issue. However, the CVE Reference Links Content Summary provided more context, revealing a directory traversal aspect. While CWE-284 is high-level, it serves as the primary classification due to the **incorrect access control** at the `doFilter` function level. The directory traversal (CWE-22) is a secondary weakness that enables the bypass of these controls.\n\nThe decision to include CWE-22 is based on the following evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The vulnerability stems from using `request.getRequestURI()` to obtain the request path without proper sanitization or validation. This allows attackers to manipulate the path using directory traversal sequences like `/static/../` to bypass access controls.\"\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity, with CWE-284 providing a general classification and CWE-22 detailing the specific mechanism for bypassing access controls. Other CWEs considered, such as CWE-862 and CWE-863, were deemed less relevant because the provided information does not explicitly mention missing or incorrect authorization checks after authentication, but rather a broader access control issue exploitable via directory traversal. The initial high score for CWE-306 was disregarded because the vulnerability description did not highlight the lack of authentication.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
