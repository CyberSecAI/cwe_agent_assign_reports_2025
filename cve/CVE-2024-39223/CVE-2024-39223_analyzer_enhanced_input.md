## Vulnerability Description
An **authentication bypass** in the SSH service of gost v2.11.5 allows attackers to intercept communications via setting the HostKeyCallback function to ssh.InsecureIgnoreHostKey

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **authentication bypass**
- **impact:** intercept communications
- **vector:** setting HostKeyCallback function
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** gost
- **version:** 2.11.5
- **component:** SSH service

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure configuration of the SSH client within the `gost` library. Specifically, the `HostKeyCallback` is set to `ssh.InsecureIgnoreHostKey()`, which disables host key verification during SSH connection establishment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Host Key Verification:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of host key verification during SSH connections. This bypasses a fundamental security mechanism designed to prevent man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.
- **CWE-305:** The gist identifies this as CWE-305, which refers to "Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness." This means that the primary weakness of skipping host key verification directly leads to the ability to bypass authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Attackers can intercept SSH connections, present a forged host key, and carry out man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Data Theft:** Attackers can potentially steal sensitive information transmitted via the compromised SSH connection.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to systems that the `gost` application connects to via SSH.
- **Malicious Actions:** Attackers can execute malicious actions on behalf of legitimate users using the compromised connection.
- **Code Execution:** The gist specifies impact code execution to true, meaning the vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Escalation of Privileges:** The gist specifies impact escalation of privileges to true, meaning the vulnerability could allow an attacker to elevate their privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Attack:** Attackers perform the attack remotely by intercepting the SSH connection between a `gost` client and a server.
- **MITM Position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and server (i.e., be "on-path").

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Interception:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the `gost` client and the target SSH server.
- **No Special Privileges Needed:** No specific access or credentials on either the `gost` client or server are required to exploit the vulnerability, other than network access.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `github.com/ginuerzh/gost/ssh.go` at line 229.
- Affected versions are `gost` <= 2.11.5
- The vulnerability affects local/remote TCP port forwarding.
- The vulnerability impacts the integrity of transmission messages.

**Suggested Solution:**
The recommended fix is to implement secure host key verification by:
- Using a known host key.
- Storing and comparing host key fingerprints against a list of trusted keys.
- Implementing a `HostKeyCallback` function that checks the host key against known or trusted keys.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
