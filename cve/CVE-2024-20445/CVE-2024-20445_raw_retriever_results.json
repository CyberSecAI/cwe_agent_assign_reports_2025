  "query": "A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Desk Phone 9800 Series, Cisco IP Phone 7800 and 8800 Series, and Cisco Video Phone 8875 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper storage of sensitive information within the web UI of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-based phone loads. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by browsing to the IP address of a device that has Web Access enabled. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive information, including incoming and outgoing call records. Note Web Access is disabled by default.",
