  "description": "vLLM is an inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs). In version 0.8.0 up to but excluding 0.9.0, the vLLM backend used with the /v1/chat/completions OpenAPI endpoint fails to validate unexpected or malformed input in the pattern and type fields when the tools functionality is invoked. These inputs are not validated before being compiled or parsed, causing a crash of the inference worker with a single request. The worker will remain down until it is restarted. Version 0.9.0 fixes the issue.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-48944 based on provided content:\n\n**CVE Description:** PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval (as per instructions)\n\n**Relevant Content:** The provided content details a vulnerability in vLLM versions >=0.8.0,<0.9.0, addressed in version 0.9.0.  This vulnerability is directly related to CVE-2025-48944. The pull request #17623 provides the fix.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vLLM backend fails to validate input in the \"pattern\" and \"type\" fields when the tools functionality is invoked. This allows malformed input to crash the inference worker.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n*   **Improper Input Validation:** Lack of validation for the \"pattern\" and \"type\" fields.\n*   **Unsafe Use of External Libraries:** Jinja2 rendering is used without proper validation or escaping before passing the result to a native regex compiler.\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A crafted request can crash the inference worker, causing a denial of service.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nBackend workers can be crashed, leading to 500 internal server errors for subsequent requests.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n*   Sending a POST request to the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint with a malformed \"type\" field (e.g., an unsupported type like \"something\").\n*   Sending a POST request with a malformed \"pattern\" field, potentially containing a crafted Jinja2 expression that causes an error in the regex compiler.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vLLM API endpoint. No authentication is explicitly mentioned as a requirement in the provided text.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n*   The vulnerability is fixed in vLLM version 0.9.0.\n*   The fix involves validating the grammar and throwing a 400 error instead of crashing the engine when xgrammar validation fails (as implemented in pull request #17623).\n\n**Additional Details (compared to a potential official CVE description):**\n\n*   The content provides specific examples of malicious payloads for both the \"type\" and \"pattern\" fields.\n*   It details the specific error messages observed during crashes, which can aid in diagnosis.\n*   It includes information about the pull request that addresses the vulnerability.\n*   It provides CVSS scoring information.\n*   It lists the individuals credited with finding and fixing the vulnerability.\n*   It shows the history of the pull request, including reviews and merges.",
