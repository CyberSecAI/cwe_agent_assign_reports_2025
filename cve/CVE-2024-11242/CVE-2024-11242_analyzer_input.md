# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-11242

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in ZZCMS 2023. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /admin/ad_list.php?action=pass of the component Keyword Filtering. The manipulation of the argument keyword leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** ZZCMS
- **version:** 2023
- **component:** /admin/ad_list.php?action=pass

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the direct concatenation of the `keyword` parameter within the `/admin/ad_list.php` component into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The lack of sanitization of the `keyword` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
  - **Data Breaches:** Accessing, modifying, or deleting sensitive data stored in the database.
  - **Privilege Escalation:**  Potentially gaining higher privileges within the system if the database user has elevated permissions.
  - **Denial of Service (DoS):** Causing the database or application to become unavailable (e.g. using sleep function, or heavy queries).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `/admin/ad_list.php` using the `keyword` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be logged in to the administrative system to access the vulnerable `/admin/ad_list.php` page.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `keyword` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection and be able to craft a suitable payload.

**Additional details:**

- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the vulnerability using a `UNION SELECT` statement combined with a `sleep(5)` function to confirm the SQL injection.
- The vulnerable code is present in the `/admin/ad_list.php` file.
- The analysis also included screenshots demonstrating the injection point of the keyword parameter.
