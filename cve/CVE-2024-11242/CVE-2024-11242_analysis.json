  "description": "A vulnerability was found in ZZCMS 2023. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /admin/ad_list.php?action=pass of the component Keyword Filtering. The manipulation of the argument keyword leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The vulnerability stems from the direct concatenation of the `keyword` parameter within the `/admin/ad_list.php` component into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The lack of sanitization of the `keyword` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:\n  - **Data Breaches:** Accessing, modifying, or deleting sensitive data stored in the database.\n  - **Privilege Escalation:**  Potentially gaining higher privileges within the system if the database user has elevated permissions.\n  - **Denial of Service (DoS):** Causing the database or application to become unavailable (e.g. using sleep function, or heavy queries).\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `/admin/ad_list.php` using the `keyword` parameter.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be logged in to the administrative system to access the vulnerable `/admin/ad_list.php` page.\n- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `keyword` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection and be able to craft a suitable payload.\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the vulnerability using a `UNION SELECT` statement combined with a `sleep(5)` function to confirm the SQL injection.\n- The vulnerable code is present in the `/admin/ad_list.php` file.\n- The analysis also included screenshots demonstrating the injection point of the keyword parameter.",

The retriever results also strongly suggest this CWE. There are no parent-child or chain relationships significantly impacting the choice, as the evidence points directly to SQL injection as the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')** (CWE-89) due to the direct concatenation of the `keyword` parameter into an SQL query without sanitization.\n2.  Impact: Arbitrary SQL execution leading to potential data breaches, privilege escalation, or denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence which clearly indicates that the application is vulnerable to **SQL Injection** due to the lack of proper sanitization of the `keyword` parameter in the `/admin/ad_list.php` script. This parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89.
