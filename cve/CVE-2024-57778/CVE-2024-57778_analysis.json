After this, the attacker changes the error code to 200 by accessing the menu page again and triggering the error.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remote attacker with network access to the vulnerable device. The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify the server's response (e.g., using Burp Suite).\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** NOINFO\n\n**More detail than the official CVE description:** This content provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) with specific steps and screenshots.",

CWE-863 is a class-level weakness for incorrect authorization. CWE-266 is more specific to the root cause of assigning incorrect privileges, making it a more appropriate primary mapping.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|ParentOf| cwe285\n    cwe266 -->|PeerOf| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe266 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the server responding with a 200 status code instead of a 500 (**Incorrect Privilege Assignment**, CWE-266). This leads to an attacker being able to escalate privileges.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the privilege escalation aspect of the vulnerability. The key evidence for **incorrect privilege assignment** is the server's response. The **root cause** is the **incorrect** assignment of privileges (responding with a 200 status code instead of a 500). This allowed an attacker to escalate privileges.\nThe selection of CWE-266 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **incorrect** privilege assignment.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
