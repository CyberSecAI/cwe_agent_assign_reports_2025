## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2024-31799:

**Vulnerability:** Interactive Shell Login Prompt Bypass

*   **Root Cause:** The device's UART port, which provides an interactive shell, can be accessed without proper authentication. The standard login prompt can be bypassed by manipulating the bootloader settings during device startup.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Insecure boot process allowing modification of boot parameters.
    *   Lack of proper authentication check before granting access to the interactive shell.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Full control over the camera's operating system.
    *   Potential to install backdoors, modify device functionality, or extract further information.
    *   Allows for efficient analysis to identify further vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Physical access to the device is required. The attacker needs to connect to the exposed UART port.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Physical access to the GNCC GC2 Indoor Security Camera.
    *   Ability to connect to the device's UART port.
    *   Knowledge of bootloader commands to bypass the login prompt.

**Additional Notes:**
