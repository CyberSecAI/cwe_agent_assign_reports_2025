  "query": "A vulnerability has been found in GNU elfutils 0.192 and classified as critical. This vulnerability affects the function __libdw_thread_tail in the library libdw_alloc.c of the component eu-readelf. The manipulation of the argument w leads to memory corruption. The attack can be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The name of the patch is 2636426a091bd6c6f7f02e49ab20d4cdc6bfc753. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.",
