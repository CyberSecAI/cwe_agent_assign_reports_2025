# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-5175

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in erdogant pypickle up to 1.1.5. It has been classified as critical. This affects the function Save of the file pypickle/pypickle.py. The manipulation leads to **improper authorization**. Attacking locally is a requirement. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 2.0.0 is able to address this issue. The patch is named 14b4cae704a0bb4eb6723e238f25382d847a1917. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper authorization**
- **product:** erdogant pypickle
- **version:** up to 1.1.5
- **component:** Save function in pypickle/pypickle.py

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
**CVE-2025-5175 Analysis**

Based on the provided content, this relates to a file overwrite vulnerability in the `pypickle` library. Here's a breakdown of the information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient validation of the file path in the `save()` function when the `overwrite` parameter is set to `True`. This allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary files.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability, insufficient input validation.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Data loss, corruption of critical files, potential security vulnerabilities, system instability, and execution of malicious payloads.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker can control the `filepath` input to the `save()` function to overwrite files.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `save()` function, meaning they need to be able to execute code that calls this function with a malicious filepath.
*   **Mitigation or fix:**
    *   Sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal (e.g., checking for "..").
    *   Restrict file paths to a specific, safe directory.
    *   Implement improved file existence checks and potentially require user confirmation before overwriting files.
    *   Log file overwrites, especially in sensitive directories.

The provided content includes a proof-of-concept exploit demonstrating how to overwrite files using relative paths.

**Note:** The release notes for version 2.0.0 indicate that significant security mechanisms have been added to address this and other vulnerabilities, including restrictions on saving files outside of home/temp directories and validation of modules during loading. However, the initial vulnerability existed prior to this release.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
