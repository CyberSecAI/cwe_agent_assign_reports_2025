  "description": "When editing objects in the Syncope Console, **incomplete HTML tags** could be used to bypass HTML sanitization. This made it possible to inject stored **XSS** payloads which would trigger for other users during ordinary usage of the application. **XSS** payloads could also be injected in Syncope Enduser when editing Personal Information or User Requests such payloads would trigger for administrators in Syncope Console, thus enabling session hijacking. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.0.9, which fixes this issue.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-45031:\n\n**Root Cause:** Incomplete HTML tags bypass HTML sanitization when editing objects in Apache Syncope, which allows for the injection of stored XSS payloads.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS issue. This means malicious scripts are not just reflected in a user's browser but are saved within the application itself.\n*   **Insufficient HTML Sanitization:** The application's HTML sanitization is not robust enough to handle incomplete HTML tags, allowing for XSS payloads.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can inject XSS payloads in Syncope Enduser, which then triggers for administrators in Syncope Console. This enables session hijacking as the malicious script can steal session cookies and other sensitive information.\n*   **Data Exposure:** Successful XSS attacks could also be leveraged to potentially steal other sensitive data.\n*   **Malicious actions:** Execution of arbitrary scripts in the context of the victim's browser can be used for various malicious actions.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Syncope Console:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by editing objects in the Syncope Console with incomplete HTML tags.\n*   **Syncope Enduser:** Attackers can inject payloads when editing \"Personal Information\" or \"User Requests\" in the Syncope Enduser interface.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have at least user-level access in the Syncope instance.\n*   **Knowledge of exploitation techniques:** The attacker needs some technical knowledge to craft the XSS payloads using incomplete HTML tags.\n\n**Affected Versions:**\n*   Apache Syncope 2.1 through 2.1.14\n*   Apache Syncope 3.0 through 3.0.8\n\n**Mitigation:**\n*   Upgrade to Apache Syncope version 3.0.9 or later to address the vulnerability.\n\nThe provided information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, outlining both the console and end-user attack vectors and the session hijacking potential.",

CWE-80 is a variant of XSS specifically related to HTML tags, providing a more specific classification. CWE-116 is a class-level CWE that describes improper encoding or escaping of output, which is a broader category that can lead to XSS. CWE-79 is parent of CWE-80.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe80[\"CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n\n    cwe80 -->|CHILDOF| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe80,cwe116 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incomplete HTML tags** which leads to the bypass of HTML sanitization. This then leads to the ability to inject stored **XSS** payloads. The XSS payloads can then be triggered for other users, and can also be injected in Syncope Enduser, which can then lead to **session hijacking**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue due to **incomplete HTML tags** being used to bypass HTML sanitization, leading to the injection of **XSS** payloads.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-79 since it directly addresses the **improper neutralization** of input during web page generation. \"The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\" This aligns with the description of the vulnerability, where user-provided input (**incomplete HTML tags**) is not properly neutralized, leading to XSS.\n\nCWE-80 is also relevant because it specifies the improper neutralization of script-related HTML tags, which is a specific case of XSS and provides a more granular classification. \"The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\" The description indicates that **incomplete HTML tags** were the attack vector, which aligns with this CWE.\n\nCWE-116, although frequently listed, is a more general weakness concerning **improper encoding or escaping of output**. While XSS often involves encoding issues, the core problem here is the **lack of neutralization** of HTML tags. Therefore, it is a secondary consideration.\n\nCWE-352 is not relevant, as it describes Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), which is a different type of vulnerability. CWE-138 is a class level CWE that describes the **improper neutralization of special elements**, while relevant, is not specific enough. CWE-330 describes the **use of insufficiently random values**, and is not relevant to this vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
