# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2025-2550

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-288 | Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel | 0.8 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE - The vulnerability description indicates **improper access controls** to the `/goform/formSetDDNS` endpoint, which suggests a potential bypass of authentication mechanisms. |
| CWE-425 | Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate - If authentication is missing, a direct request might be possible. |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate - The vulnerability description suggests a potential lack of proper authentication for a critical function, which allows an attacker to access a sensitive function directly. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-288 Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel, is related to CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function as CWE-288 is a PARENTOF of CWE-306. CWE-425 Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') is also related, as it represents the potential impact if authentication is missing or bypassed. The abstraction levels of these CWEs (all Base or Variant) are appropriate for representing the specific weakness.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper access controls** (CWE-288). This **weakness** potentially leads to the ability to make direct requests (CWE-425) to sensitive functionalities, potentially because of missing authentication (CWE-306). The vulnerability description specifically mentions **improper access controls**, making it the most appropriate root cause.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified several potential CWEs, including CWE-79, CWE-89, and CWE-78, based on the retriever results. However, these CWEs focus on **improper neutralization of input**, which is not explicitly mentioned in the vulnerability description. The description emphasizes **improper access controls** for the `/goform/formSetDDNS` endpoint. This suggests a problem with authentication or authorization, rather than input validation.

Given the available evidence, CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) appears to be the most accurate primary CWE. The vulnerability description states that there are **improper access controls**, which aligns with the concept of bypassing authentication. CWE-425 and CWE-306 are reasonable secondary candidates. These CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity (Base) and align with the observed behavior.

The relationships between CWEs reinforce this selection. CWE-288 is a parent of CWE-306, indicating that a missing authentication function can be a specific type of authentication bypass. CWE-425 represents a possible impact, where an attacker can directly access resources due to the authentication bypass.

The final selection is based on the available evidence, relationship analysis, and mapping guidance. While the retriever results suggest several CWEs related to input validation, the vulnerability description focuses on **improper access controls**, making CWE-288 the most appropriate primary CWE.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-912: Hidden Functionality
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

The product contains functionality that is not documented, not part of the specification, and not accessible through an interface or command sequence that is obvious to the product's users or administrators.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
