Translating the below lockdep splat, CPU1 #6 will wait on CPU0 #1, CPU0 #8 will wait on CPU2 #3, and CPU2 #7 will wait on CPU1 #4 (if theres a writer, due to the fairness of r/w semaphores).

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, the content relates to **CVE-2024-47744**.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe root cause is a potential deadlock in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux kernel on x86 architectures. The deadlock occurs due to a complex interaction of multiple locks, including `kvm->slots_lock`, `vcpu->mutex`, `kvm->srcu`, `cpu_hotplug_lock`, and `kvm_lock`. Specifically, the `kvm_usage_count` was previously protected by `kvm_lock`, leading to the deadlock when CPU hotplug operations interact with other KVM operations that also take these locks.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Circular locking dependency**: A circular dependency occurs when threads try to acquire locks in an order that creates a cycle, leading to a deadlock.\n- **Improper lock ordering**: The original implementation had `cpus_read_lock()` being taken outside of `kvm_lock` which could cause a deadlock.\n- **Use of shared locks for unrelated resources**: The `kvm_lock` was used for both `kvm_usage_count` and other operations, causing contention and potential deadlocks.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Deadlock:** The primary impact is a system deadlock, where the kernel becomes unresponsive, requiring a reboot to recover. This can lead to denial of service.\n- **Unpredictable behavior:** The interaction between CPU hotplug, VM operations and the locking issues can cause unpredictable behavior and system instability.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- **Specific KVM operations:** Triggering the deadlock requires specific KVM operations such as modifying memory slots (memslots), setting MSRs (Model Specific Registers), or using NX huge pages.\n- **CPU hotplug**: The vulnerability involves contention with the `cpu_hotplug_lock` so triggering CPU online/offline events are part of the attack vector.\n- **Timing:** The deadlock is sensitive to timing, requiring the right sequence of operations and lock acquisitions to manifest.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- **Privileged access:** The attacker would need the ability to perform KVM operations, typically requiring root or specific virtualization privileges.\n- **Specific VM configuration:** The specific VM configuration, such as the use of NX huge pages and older CPUs without a constant TSC, increases the likelihood of triggering the deadlock.\n- **Control over CPU hotplug:** The attacker would need to have control over CPU online/offline events to trigger the lock contention involved in the deadlock.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- The provided patches introduce a dedicated mutex, `kvm_usage_lock`, to protect the `kvm_usage_count`.\n- The patches also add comments in the locking documentation to highlight the issues of taking `cpus_read_lock()` outside of `kvm_lock` and walking the vm\\_list.\n- The fix addresses the most blatant deadlock issue with the use of a dedicated mutex instead of using a single mutex for multiple resources.",
