# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-47744
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved KVM Use dedicated mutex to protect kvm_usage_count to avoid deadlock Use a dedicated mutex to guard kvm_usage_count to fix a potential deadlock on x86 due to a chain of locks and SRCU synchronizations. Translating the below lockdep splat, CPU1 #6 will wait on CPU0 #1, CPU0 #8 will wait on CPU2 #3, and CPU2 #7 will wait on CPU1 #4 (if theres a writer, due to the fairness of r/w semaphores). CPU0 CPU1 CPU2 1 lock(&kvm->slots_lock) 2 lock(&vcpu->mutex) 3 lock(&kvm->srcu) 4 lock(cpu_hotplug_lock) 5 lock(kvm_lock) 6 lock(&kvm->slots_lock) 7 lock(cpu_hotplug_lock) 8 sync(&kvm->srcu) Note, there are likely more potential deadlocks in KVM x86, e.g. the same pattern of taking cpu_hotplug_lock outside of kvm_lock likely exists with __kvmclock_cpufreq_notifier() cpuhp_cpufreq_online() | -> cpufreq_online() | -> cpufreq_gov_performance_limits() | -> __cpufreq_driver_target() | -> __target_index() | -> cpufreq_freq_transition_begin() | -> cpufreq_notify_transition() | -> .

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'chain of locks', 'SRCU synchronizations'
- **weakness**: 'potential deadlock'
