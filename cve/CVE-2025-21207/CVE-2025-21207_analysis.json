The retriever results suggest CWE-833 (Deadlock) as the top candidate. Given the limited information in the description and the lack of CVE Reference Links Content Summary, the confidence in this mapping is low.\n\nThe decision is heavily based on the \"Retriever Results\" section, specifically the \"Top Combined Results\" table. The vulnerability description's key phrases only point to a \"Denial of Service\", which is a symptom rather than a root cause. Without further information, it is challenging to determine the exact nature of the **weakness**.\n\nSeveral other CWEs were considered but ultimately rejected due to lack of evidence:\n*   CWE-228: Improper Handling of Syntactically Invalid Structure\n*   CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\n*   CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n*   CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\n*   CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\n*   CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n*   CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\n*   CWE-67: Improper Handling of Windows Device Names\n*   CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\n\nRelevant CWE Information:",
