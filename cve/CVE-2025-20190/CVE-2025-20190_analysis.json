  "description": "A vulnerability in the lobby ambassador web interface of Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to remove arbitrary users that are defined on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to **insufficient access control** of actions executed by lobby ambassador users. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to an affected device with a lobby ambassador user account and sending crafted HTTP requests to the API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary user accounts on the device, including users with administrative privileges. Note This vulnerability is exploitable only if the attacker obtains the credentials for a lobby ambassador account. This account is not configured by default.",

Since the vulnerability is due to **insufficient access control**, which translates to authorization issues, a more specific CWE like CWE-863 is preferred over the more general CWE-285. However, CWE-285 is considered as a secondary option because it broadly defines the authorization issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient access control**, leading to the ability of a lobby ambassador user to send crafted HTTP requests and delete arbitrary user accounts, including those with administrative privileges.\n\nRoot Cause: **Insufficient Access Control**\nWeakness: Incorrect Authorization\nImpact: Removal of arbitrary users and deletion of user accounts with administrative privileges\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis heavily relies on the vulnerability description and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\", which explicitly mentions that the root cause is **insufficient access control** of actions executed by lobby ambassador users. Based on the Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance, **insufficient access control** after authentication points towards an authorization issue. Given that the authorization check is present, but flawed, CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is the most appropriate choice. While CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) could also be considered, CWE-863 provides a more specific classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
