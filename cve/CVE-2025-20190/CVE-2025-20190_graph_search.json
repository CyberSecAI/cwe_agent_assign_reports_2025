This vulnerability is due to insufficient access control of actions executed by lobby ambassador users. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to an affected device with a lobby ambassador user account and sending crafted HTTP requests to the API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary user accounts on the device, including users with administrative privileges. Note This vulnerability is exploitable only if the attacker obtains the credentials for a lobby ambassador account. This account is not configured by default.
