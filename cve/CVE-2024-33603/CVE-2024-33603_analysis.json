CWE-306 is considered as a secondary weakness because the vulnerable log page doesn't require authentication. While CWE-306 could be argued as a root cause, the primary impact is the exposure of sensitive information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n\n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n    class cwe532 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of authentication** (CWE-306) for accessing the system log page, leading to the **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200) such as memory addresses and IP addresses. This **information disclosure vulnerability** can further lead to session hijacking due to the reliance on IP addresses for authentication.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **information disclosure vulnerability** (CWE-200), where unauthenticated users can access a verbose system log page containing sensitive data. This aligns with the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary, which highlights the exposure of memory addresses, IP addresses, and other sensitive data.\n\nCWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is a contributing factor, as the **lack of authentication** allows unauthenticated users to access the log page. However, the core issue is the exposure of sensitive data, making CWE-200 the primary classification.\n\nThe retriever results also support this, with CWE-200 having a high similarity score. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-306 can precede CWE-200.\n\nThe selection of CWE-200 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly describes the **information disclosure vulnerability**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
