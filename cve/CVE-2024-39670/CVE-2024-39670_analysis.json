CWE-267 and CWE-285 are secondary considerations. CWE-266 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred. The vulnerability description indicates a privilege escalation issue within the account synchronization module. The description contains the key phrase \"**Privilege escalation vulnerability**\".
