  "description": "The Registration Forms User Registration Forms, Invitation-Based Registrations, Front-end User Profile, Login Form & Content Restriction Social Sites Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.9. This is due to **insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the email and the user does not have an already-existing account for the service returning the token.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-11293:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient verification of the user data returned by the social login token within the \"Pie Register - Social Sites Login\" plugin for WordPress. This lack of proper validation allows an attacker to manipulate the social login process.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Improper Authentication:** The core weakness is an improper authentication mechanism that fails to adequately verify the identity of a user logging in through a social login provider.\n*   **Authentication Bypass:**  This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the intended authentication process.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Account Takeover:** An attacker can log in as any existing user, including administrators, if they know the target user's email address and if the target user doesn't have an existing account for the service returning the token. This provides complete access to user accounts.\n*   **Full Control:** If an attacker gains control of an administrator account, they can potentially take full control of the affected website. This includes the ability to modify content, install malware, steal data, and delete data.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Social Login Manipulation:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability by manipulating the social login process by using a social login service.\n*  **Email Address:** The attacker needs access to the target user's email address.\n*  **No Account on Social Service**: Target user shouldn't have a pre-existing account on the social service the attacker is exploiting.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to initiate the attack.\n*   **Email Address Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the email address of the user they wish to impersonate.\n*   **No Existing Social Account:** Target user shouldn't have an existing account with the social login service the attacker is using.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n* The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including version 1.7.9.\n* The vendor released a patch in version 1.8",

However, based on the vulnerability description, the weakness is primarily related to **insufficient verification** which falls under authentication. CWE-306 is a child of CWE-287 and represents a more specific scenario where authentication is missing entirely. Since the vulnerability description specifies **insufficient verification**, CWE-287 is more appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token** (CWE-287), which allows an unauthenticated attacker to log in as any existing user (account takeover).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on the **insufficient verification** aspect of the social login process, leading to the selection of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). The retriever results also highlighted CWE-287 and CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) as potential candidates.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions **insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token**, which aligns with the definition of CWE-287. The CVE reference links content summary also confirms this, stating: \"*The core weakness is an improper authentication mechanism that fails to adequately verify the identity of a user logging in through a social login provider*.\"\n\nAlthough CWE-306 was considered, the presence of *some* authentication mechanism (the social login) distinguishes it from a scenario where authentication is entirely missing. The **insufficient verification** within the existing authentication process makes CWE-287 the more fitting choice.\n\nThe selection is based on the available evidence and confirmed by the CVE summary. The chosen CWE is at the Class level, but no more specific child CWE accurately captures the essence of **insufficient verification** in this context.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-287: Improper Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.669\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authentication step, but it contains a design or implementation flaw that makes the authentication unreliable.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.648\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n# Detailed Analysis\n## CWE-287: Improper Authentication\n*   **Technical Explanation:** The WordPress plugin uses social login for authentication, but it **does not properly verify the user information** returned by the social login provider. This allows an attacker to bypass authentication by manipulating the social login process.\n*   **Security Implications:** An attacker can log in as any existing user, including administrators, leading to account takeover and potential full control of the website.\n*   **Relationship Analysis:** CWE-287 is a Class-level CWE. While it has child CWEs, none of them specifically address the scenario of **insufficient verification** in a social login context.\n*   **Mapping Guidance:** The MITRE mapping guidance suggests that this CWE is Allowed-with-Review because it is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate. However, in this case, the specificity of **insufficient verification** within an existing authentication process makes CWE-287 the most fitting choice.\n*   **Evidence:** The vulnerability description states \"*This is due to **insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token**.*\" The CVE reference links content summary also confirms this, stating: \"*The core weakness is an improper authentication mechanism that fails to adequately verify the identity of a user logging in through a social login provider*.\"\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n*   **Technical Explanation:** While an attacker can bypass the intended authentication, the vulnerability isn't due to a complete lack of authentication but rather **insufficient verification** within the social login process.\n*   **Security Implications:** Similar to CWE-287, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to user accounts and potentially the entire website.\n*   **Relationship Analysis:** CWE-306 is a child of CWE-287, representing a more specific case where authentication is entirely missing.\n*   **Mapping Guidance:** The MITRE mapping guidance suggests that this CWE is Allowed.\n*   **Why Not Selected:** This CWE was considered but ultimately rejected because the vulnerability involves **insufficient verification** rather than a complete absence of authentication. The social login mechanism is present, but it **does not adequately verify** the user's identity.\n\n## CWEs Considered but Not Used\n*   CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key): These CWEs relate to authorization issues, but the primary problem here is with the authentication process itself, specifically the **insufficient verification** of user identity during social login.\n*   CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)): CSRF is a different type of vulnerability that exploits trust between a user and a website, which is not the case here.\n*   CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data): This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability does not involve the insertion of sensitive information into sent data.\n*   CWE-472 (External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter): While the social login token can be seen as an externally controlled parameter, the core issue is the **insufficient verification** of the user data within that token, not the external control itself.",
