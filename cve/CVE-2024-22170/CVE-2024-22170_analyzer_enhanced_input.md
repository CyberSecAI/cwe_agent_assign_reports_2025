    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (Score: 431.32)

The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data....

### 2. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 361.26)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...
