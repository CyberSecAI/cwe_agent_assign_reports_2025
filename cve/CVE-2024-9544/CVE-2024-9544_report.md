# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-9544

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-9544

## Description

The MapSVG plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 8.6.4 due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** insufficient input sanitization and output escaping
- **Vector:** SVG File uploads
- **Weakness:** ['cross-site scripting', 'Stored Cross-Site Scripting']
- **Product:** MapSVG plugin for WordPress
- **Impact:** inject arbitrary web scripts
- **Attacker:** authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access and above
- **Version:** all versions up to and including 8.6.4

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-79 | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') | 1 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE: The vulnerability is directly caused by **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** when generating web pages, leading to stored XSS. |
| CWE-434 | Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary: The vulnerability is exposed by uploading SVG files. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-79, which is a base-level CWE. CWE-79 has relationships to other CWEs, like CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output), since encoding/escaping is a common way to neutralize input. The **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** directly relates to CWE-79. CWE-434 is included as a secondary CWE because the vector for the XSS is via SVG file uploads.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** (CWE-79). An attacker uploads a malicious SVG file (CWE-434), which is then stored on the server. When another user accesses the SVG file, the malicious script is executed in their browser, leading to Cross-Site Scripting.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which indicates that the MapSVG plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** of SVG file uploads. The primary CWE is CWE-79, which directly addresses the root cause. CWE-434 is added as a secondary CWE because it is the mechanism used to exploit the XSS vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

*Not Selected*: CSRF is not indicated in the description.

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Selected*: SVG file upload is the attack vector.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: Authorization is not called out in the description.

## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected*: CWE-79 is a more specific child of this Class.

## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: CWE-79 is a more general case that fits better.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This is not applicable to the vulnerability description.

## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Selected*: This is the primary CWE because the root cause is **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**.

## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected*: CWE-79 is a more specific child of this Class.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected*: This is not applicable to the vulnerability description.
