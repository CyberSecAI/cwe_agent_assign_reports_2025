The vulnerability is present in the HTTP response headers and rendered JavaScript before user login, meaning no user interaction is required.\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote attacker, no authentication required.\n\nThe provided content also mentions two other CVEs (CVE-2024-42408 and CVE-2024-39287) related to other vulnerabilities in the same product, but they are not relevant to CVE-2024-42493.",

The retriever results did not provide more specific Base or Variant level CWEs that were a better fit. While CWE-200 is discouraged as a primary mapping, the evidence supports it as the best available option given the information provided.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe200 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **exposure of sensitive information** through response headers and rendered JavaScript prior to user login, which directly leads to the impact of potential data theft and misuse of credentials. The root cause is the **leak of sensitive information**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **exposure of sensitive information**. The CVE description clearly states that sensitive information is leaked through response headers and rendered JavaScript before user login.\n\nThe retriever results suggested several potential CWEs, including:\n*   CWE-540 Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Source Code\n*   CWE-113 Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n*   CWE-201 Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\n*   CWE-93 Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\n*   CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n\nHowever, after reviewing the complete CWE specifications and considering the specific details of the vulnerability, CWE-200, Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor, appears to be the most appropriate.\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200)\".\n\nCWE-200 is a Class-level CWE and is generally discouraged. However, the retriever results did not provide better options.\n\nThe decision is primarily based on the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which identifies CWE-200 as the weakness/vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
