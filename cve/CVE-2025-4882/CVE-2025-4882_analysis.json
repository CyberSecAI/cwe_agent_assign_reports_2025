The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter 'team' and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\nSQL injection\n\nImpact of exploitation:\nAttackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption, posing a serious threat to system security and business continuity.\n\nAttack vectors:\nThe vulnerability is in the 'team' parameter in the '/admin/team_update.php' file.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\nNo login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability\n\nMitigation or fix:\n1. Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n2. Input validation and filtering.\n3. Minimize database user permissions.\n4. Regular security audits.\n```",
