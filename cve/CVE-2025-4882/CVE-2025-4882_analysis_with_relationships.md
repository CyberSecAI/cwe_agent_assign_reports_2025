# Enhanced Analysis for CVE-2025-4882

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is that CWE-89 is a base-level weakness that directly addresses the **SQL Injection** vulnerability. There are no other relationships that seem to directly impact this decision. The abstraction level of "Base" is appropriate as it directly describes the **SQL Injection** issue.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an SQL command, leading directly to the **SQL Injection** vulnerability.
  - Root Cause: **Improper Neutralization** (CWE-89)
  - Impact: **SQL Injection**

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links. The vulnerability description clearly states that the manipulation of the `team` argument leads to **SQL injection**. The CVE reference link content summary confirms this, stating that the root cause is that attackers inject malicious code from the `team` parameter and use it directly in SQL queries without appropriate cleaning or validation. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the primary weakness.

The selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly identifies the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **improper neutralization** of special elements in an SQL command.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 900.30
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

The other CWEs were considered but not used as they were not as directly relevant to the root cause of the **SQL injection** vulnerability. For example, CWE-79 ('Cross-site Scripting') and CWE-434 ('Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type') are related to different types of vulnerabilities.
