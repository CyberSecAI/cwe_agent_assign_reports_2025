  "reference_content": "The provided content is related to CVE-2024-48746 and provides a detailed description of the vulnerability.\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe root cause is insufficient input validation and client-side control mechanisms within the Lens Visual Power BI integration's natural language processing component. This allows for prompt injection attacks.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Prompt Injection (LLM01):**  The system is vulnerable to prompt injection attacks due to lack of proper input sanitization. Attackers can manipulate the language model's behavior by injecting malicious instructions.\n- **Client-Side Control:**  The configuration and restrictions for the chat system are implemented client-side, allowing attackers to modify these settings, which contributes to the prompt injection vulnerability.\n- **Lack of Input Validation:** Absence of adequate input validation and sanitization allows for malicious code injection via user input fields.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the system by injecting and executing Python code (or other commands).\n- **Information Disclosure:**  Exploitation can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.\n- **Compromised Data Integrity and Confidentiality:** Attackers can manipulate data interactions, execute unauthorized commands, and potentially extract sensitive server information.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Malicious Text Input:**  An attacker injects malicious instructions into text input fields.\n- **Prompt Manipulation:** An attacker directly manipulates prompts to bypass intended functionality and execute unintended actions.\n- **Base64 Encoded Payload:** The attacker uses Base64 encoding to inject a Python command which then gets executed by the server-side component.\n- **Modified Chat Configuration:** Attackers can modify client-side chat configurations to weaken restrictions.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Remote Access:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability remotely via the application's API interface.\n- **Ability to send crafted prompts:** The attacker must be able to send crafted prompts that include malicious code or instructions to the system.",

The **'Eval Injection' (CWE-95)** weakness is present as the code being executed is dynamically evaluated and can be influenced by attacker controlled prompts. The relationship between these CWEs is that **CWE-1427** can lead to **CWE-95** and is a specific type of **CWE-20**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1427[\"CWE-1427: Improper Neutralization of Input Used for LLM Prompting\"]\n    cwe95[\"CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe1427 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe1427 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe95\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1427 primary\n    class cwe95,cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation (CWE-20)** and **improper neutralization of input for LLM prompting (CWE-1427)**, leading to the ability to inject code. This injected code is then dynamically evaluated, resulting in **'Eval Injection' (CWE-95)**, which leads to arbitrary code execution on the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is **CWE-1427**, as it accurately describes the root cause of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description and CVE details both confirm that **improper input handling** and **lack of input validation** in the NLP component allow for malicious code injection.\nThe evidence to support this is:\n- \"The root cause is insufficient input validation and client-side control mechanisms within the Lens Visual Power BI integration's natural language processing component. This allows for prompt injection attacks.\"\n- \"**Prompt Injection (LLM01):**  The system is vulnerable to prompt injection attacks due to lack of proper input sanitization. Attackers can manipulate the language model's behavior by injecting malicious instructions.\"\n- \"Absence of adequate input validation and sanitization allows for malicious code injection via user input fields.\"\n**CWE-95** is included as a secondary CWE since the injected input is then dynamically evaluated.\n\nThe retriever results suggested **CWE-20**, **CWE-1336**, and **CWE-78**. **CWE-20** is too broad, and **CWE-1336** is for template engines, which does not fit the vulnerability details. **CWE-78** is for OS command injection, which is a potential impact, but not the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
