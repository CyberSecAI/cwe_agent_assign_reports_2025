An attacker, possessing regular user privileges or listed in the IP whitelist, could potentially acquire the administrators account and password through specific interfaces. Such an action would grant them full control over RocketMQ, provided they have access to the broker IP address list. To mitigate these security threats, it is strongly advised that users upgrade to version 5.3.0 or newer. Additionally, we recommend users to use RocketMQ ACL 2.0 instead of the original RocketMQ ACL when upgrading to version Apache RocketMQ 5.3.0. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-863 CWE-306 CWE-201 CWE-269 CWE-285 CWE-522 CWE-200 CWE-214 CWE-532",
