## Vulnerability Description
An **LDAP injection** vulnerability in the login page of Gladinet CentreStack v13.12.9934.54690 allows attackers to access sensitive data or execute arbitrary commands via a crafted payload injected into the username field.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **LDAP injection**
- **impact:** access sensitive data and execute arbitrary commands
- **vector:** crafted payload
- **attacker:** attackers
- **product:** Gladinet CentreStack
- **version:** v13.12.9934.54690
- **component:** login page

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-37782:

**Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in the username field of the CentreStack login portal. This allows an attacker to inject malicious LDAP queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **LDAP Injection:** The primary vulnerability is LDAP injection, which occurs because user-supplied input in the username field is directly used in LDAP queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Data Retrieval:** Attackers can potentially retrieve sensitive data from the Active Directory (AD) infrastructure, including user names, addresses, and other LDAP attributes.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** While not explicitly detailed, the possibility of performing unauthorized actions through LDAP queries is mentioned.
*   **User Enumeration:** By analyzing the different error messages ('AUTH_FAILED' vs. 'NOT_FOUND') returned by the application, attackers can enumerate valid user names in the system.
*   **Time-Based Blind LDAP Injection:** Even with generic error messages, attackers can use the timing of server responses to conduct a time-based blind LDAP injection attack to enumerate AD attributes.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is the login page of the CentreStack application.
*   Attackers inject malicious LDAP payloads into the username field during the login process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have network access to the CentreStack login page.
*   No specific authentication is required before attempting the injection; the attacker can try injecting payloads directly into the username field.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered in version 13.12.9934.54690, and it's unknown if earlier versions are vulnerable.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 14.3.9987.54969 via input validation.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited regardless of the error message setting by using time-based blind techniques.

This information provides more detail than the standard CVE description, including specific attack techniques like error message analysis and time-based blind injection.
