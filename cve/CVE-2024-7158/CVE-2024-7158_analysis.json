  "description": "A vulnerability was found in TOTOLINK A3100R 4.1.2cu.5050_B20200504. It has been declared as critical. This vulnerability affects the function setTelnetCfg of the file /cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi of the component HTTP POST Request Handler. The manipulation of the argument telnet_enabled leads to **command injection**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-272572. NOTE The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `setTelnetCfg` function of the TOTOLINK A3100R router's firmware. Specifically, the `telnet_enabled` parameter, which is received via a POST request, is not validated before being used.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. The user-controlled input within `telnet_enabled` is directly used, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed by the system.\n*  **Buffer Overflow:** While the primary vulnerability is command injection, the Github document also mentions a possible buffer overflow due to the uncontrolled input of the 'telnet_enabled' parameter.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain complete control of the affected router. This includes:\n    *   Executing arbitrary system commands\n    *   Modifying router configurations\n    *   Potentially using the router as part of a botnet\n    *   Accessing sensitive data on the network\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint.\n*   The attacker needs to include a `telnet_enabled` parameter within the JSON data of the POST request, with malicious commands injected into this parameter.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface. This can be either through local network or remotely if the router's web interface is exposed to the internet.\n*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests.\n*   The attacker can use the provided proof of concept (POC) to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*   **Affected Firmware:** TOTOLINK A3100R V4.1.2cu.5050\\_B20200504\n*   **Vulnerable Function:** `setTelnetCfg`\n*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `telnet_enabled`\n*   **Exploitation Method:** HTTP POST request to `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` with a crafted `telnet_enabled` value\n\nThis information provides a more detailed view of the vulnerability than the standard CVE description.",
