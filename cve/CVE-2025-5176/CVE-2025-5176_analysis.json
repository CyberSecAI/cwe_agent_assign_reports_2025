The **root cause** is the **improper neutralization of special elements** in an SQL command (CWE-89).\n2.  The impact is a successful SQL Injection attack due to the **lack of proper input validation**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states that the manipulation of the \"Usurio\" argument leads to **sql injection**. This direct statement provides strong evidence for assigning CWE-89 as the primary weakness. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89, with a high similarity score. The description aligns perfectly with CWE-89's definition, which focuses on the **improper neutralization of special elements** in SQL commands. The provided evidence directly supports the classification of this vulnerability as CWE-89, and the confidence level is high.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
