  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Golang FIPS OpenSSL. This flaw allows a malicious user to randomly cause an **uninitialized buffer length variable** with a zeroed buffer to be returned in FIPS mode. It may also be possible to force a false positive match between non-equal hashes when comparing a trusted computed hmac sum to an untrusted input sum if an attacker can send a zeroed buffer in place of a pre-computed sum. It is also possible to force a derived key to be all zeros instead of an unpredictable value. This may have follow-on implications for the Go TLS stack.",

CWE-456 (Missing Initialization of a Variable) is a variant of CWE-665 (Improper Initialization), providing a more specific classification. The CANPRECEDE relationship between CWE-456 and CWE-457 (Use of Uninitialized Variable) indicates a potential chain of events where a missing initialization leads to the use of an uninitialized variable. This helped solidify the choice of CWE-456 as the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe456[\"CWE-456: Missing Initialization of a Variable\"]\n    cwe665[\"CWE-665: Improper Initialization\"]\n    cwe457[\"CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable\"]\n    cwe824[\"CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe456 -->|CHILDOF| cwe665\n    cwe456 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe457\n    cwe824 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe456 primary\n    class cwe665,cwe457,cwe824,cwe787 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-456 (Missing Initialization of a Variable)**, which leads to the **uninitialized buffer length variable**. This can lead to **CWE-824 (Access of Uninitialized Pointer)** if the uninitialized length is used as a pointer. This can lead to **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)** if the pointer is dereferenced and used to write data. This ultimately results in a zeroed buffer being returned, potentially leading to a false positive match or a derived key of all zeros.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which was determined to be the **uninitialized buffer length variable**. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE details strongly supports this conclusion. The relationship analysis further reinforced the choice of CWE-456 as the primary CWE, as it is a specific variant of improper initialization. The chain of events from missing initialization to the final impact was also considered.\n\nThe selection of CWE-456 is based on the following evidence:\n- \"This flaw allows a malicious user to randomly cause an **uninitialized buffer length variable** with a zeroed buffer to be returned in FIPS mode\"\n- \"The vulnerability stems from an **uninitialized buffer length variable** in the CGO bindings of the golang-fips package\"\n- \"The primary weakness is the presence of an **uninitialized buffer length variable.**\"\n\nThe choice of CWE-456 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the missing initialization of a variable, rather than a more general improper initialization. The MITRE mapping guidance allows for the use of Variant level CWEs when they accurately represent the weakness.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   **CWE-456 (Missing Initialization of a Variable):** The product does not initialize a variable, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. In this case, the **uninitialized buffer length variable** leads to a zeroed buffer being returned, potentially causing false positive matches or derived keys of all zeros.\n*   **CWE-824 (Access of Uninitialized Pointer):** The product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized. The **uninitialized buffer length variable** can be interpreted as a pointer that has not been initialized.\n*   **CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write):** The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer. If the **uninitialized buffer length variable** is used, it can cause out-of-bounds writes to the buffer and cause it to zero out.",
