  "description": "The Frontend Admin by DynamiApps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the orderby parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.25.1 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. This requires an unauthenticated user to have been given permission to view form submissions, and the form submission shortcode be added to a page.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-11722:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization and preparation of the `orderby` parameter used in SQL queries within the \"Frontend Admin\" WordPress plugin. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **SQL Injection:** The plugin fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `orderby` parameter within the plugin's SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code, modifying the intended query.\n- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The plugin does not properly validate or escape the `orderby` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can leverage the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the database, potentially including user credentials, configuration details, or other confidential information.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **HTTP Request:** The attack is performed via HTTP requests by manipulating the `orderby` parameter in the request URL. The plugin uses the unsanitized `$_REQUEST['orderby']` directly in SQL queries, allowing the attacker to inject malicious SQL.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers.\n- **Form Submission View Permission**:  An unauthenticated user needs to have been given permission to view form submissions.\n- **Shortcode Usage:** The form submission shortcode must be added to a page.\n\n**Additional details from the provided content:**\n\n-   The vulnerable code was located in multiple files related to data retrieval and listing functionality.\n- The vulnerability was fixed by replacing `esc_sql` with `sanitize_sql_orderby` for sanitizing the `orderby` parameter\n- The vulnerable code snippets were present in the following files, amongst others:\n  - `main/admin/admin-pages/emails/crud.php`\n  - `main/admin/admin-pages/payments/crud.php`\n  - `main/admin/admin-pages/payments/list.php`\n  - `main/admin/admin-pages/plans/crud.php`\n  - `main/admin/admin-pages/plans/list.php`\n  - `main/admin/admin-pages/submissions/crud.php`\n  - `main/admin/admin-pages/subscriptions/crud.php`\n  - `main/admin/admin-pages/subscriptions/list.php`",

The **rootcause** is identified as **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**, which directly leads to the **SQL injection** vulnerability.\n\nThe retriever results strongly suggested CWE-89, which is the most specific and appropriate CWE for this vulnerability.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the SQL Injection vulnerability caused by the **insufficient escaping** and **lack of preparation** of the SQL query.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
