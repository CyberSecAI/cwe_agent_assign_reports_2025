## Vulnerability Description
The Frontend Admin by DynamiApps plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the orderby parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.25.1 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. This requires an unauthenticated user to have been given permission to view form submissions, and the form submission shortcode be added to a page.

- **attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **product:** Frontend Admin by DynamiApps plugin for WordPress
- **version:** all versions up to and including 3.25.1
- **component:** orderby parameter

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-11722:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization and preparation of the `orderby` parameter used in SQL queries within the "Frontend Admin" WordPress plugin. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The plugin fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `orderby` parameter within the plugin's SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code, modifying the intended query.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The plugin does not properly validate or escape the `orderby` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can leverage the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the database, potentially including user credentials, configuration details, or other confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request:** The attack is performed via HTTP requests by manipulating the `orderby` parameter in the request URL. The plugin uses the unsanitized `$_REQUEST['orderby']` directly in SQL queries, allowing the attacker to inject malicious SQL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers.
- **Form Submission View Permission**:  An unauthenticated user needs to have been given permission to view form submissions.
- **Shortcode Usage:** The form submission shortcode must be added to a page.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

-   The vulnerable code was located in multiple files related to data retrieval and listing functionality.
- The vulnerability was fixed by replacing `esc_sql` with `sanitize_sql_orderby` for sanitizing the `orderby` parameter
- The vulnerable code snippets were present in the following files, amongst others:
  - `main/admin/admin-pages/emails/crud.php`
  - `main/admin/admin-pages/payments/crud.php`
  - `main/admin/admin-pages/payments/list.php`
  - `main/admin/admin-pages/plans/crud.php`
  - `main/admin/admin-pages/plans/list.php`
  - `main/admin/admin-pages/submissions/crud.php`
  - `main/admin/admin-pages/subscriptions/crud.php`
  - `main/admin/admin-pages/subscriptions/list.php`

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
