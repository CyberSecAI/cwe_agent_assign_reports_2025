## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's the breakdown of the SQL injection vulnerability found in the provided content:

*   **Vulnerability:** SQL injection
*   **Affected File:** `/profile.php`
*   **Affected Parameter:** `mobilenumber`
*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the `mobilenumber` parameter before using it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Impact:**  Allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to the database, cause sensitive data leakage, tamper with data, gain complete control over the system, and even disrupt services.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker can send a crafted HTTP POST request to `/profile.php` with a malicious payload in the `mobilenumber` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No login or authorization is required.
*   **Payload Example:** A time-based blind SQL injection payload is provided.
*   **Mitigation/Fix:**
    *   Employ prepared statements and parameter binding.
    *   Conduct input validation and filtering.
    *   Minimize database user permissions.
