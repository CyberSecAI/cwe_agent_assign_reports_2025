# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-10628

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-10628

## Description

The Quiz Maker Business, Developer, and Agency plugins for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the id parameter in all versions up to, and including, 8.8.0 (Business), up to, and including, 21.8.0 (Developer), and up to, and including, 31.8.0 (Agency) due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. NOTE The three variations of this software (Business, Developer, and Agency) share the same plugin slug, so you may get an alert even if you are running the latest version of any of the pieces of software. In these cases it is safe to dismiss the notice once youve confirmed your site is on a patched version of the applicable software.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query
- **Weakness:** ['lack of input escaping', 'SQL injection']
- **Impact:** ['extract sensitive information from the database', 'extract sensitive information from database', 'SQL Injection']
- **Attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **Product:** ['and Agency plugins for WordPress', 'Quiz Maker Business', 'Developer']
- **Version:** ['Developer up to and including 21.8.0', 'Business up to and including 8.8.0', 'Agency up to and including 31.8.0']

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CWE-89** | **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')** | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-116 | Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.6 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-89** [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')], which stems from **insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient preparation** in the SQL query. This is further supported by the high scores and frequency of **CWE-89** [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')] in the keyphrase analysis. **CWE-116** [Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output] and **CWE-20** [Improper Input Validation] are considered secondary because they represent more general weaknesses that contribute to the root cause. **CWE-89** [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')] is a child of **CWE-74** [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')], but **CWE-89** [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')] is more specific and therefore more appropriate.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient preparation** in the SQL query (leading to **CWE-89** [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')]). This allows unauthenticated attackers to inject SQL queries, which can then be used to **extract sensitive information from the database**.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary CWE is **CWE-89** [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')] due to the **insufficient escaping** and **lack of sufficient preparation** on the existing SQL query. The evidence is strong as the vulnerability description explicitly mentions "SQL Injection" and the root cause analysis identifies the **lack of escaping** and **preparation** as the underlying issue. While other CWEs like **CWE-116** [Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output] and **CWE-20** [Improper Input Validation] are related, **CWE-89** [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')] is the most precise classification for this vulnerability, especially considering the high scores in the keyphrase analysis.

**CWE-78** [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')], **CWE-79** [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')], and **CWE-90** [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection')] were considered but not selected because the vulnerability specifically involves SQL injection, not OS command injection, XSS, or LDAP injection. **CWE-20** [Improper Input Validation] and **CWE-116** [Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output] are too general. **CWE-89** [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')] provides the right level of specificity.
