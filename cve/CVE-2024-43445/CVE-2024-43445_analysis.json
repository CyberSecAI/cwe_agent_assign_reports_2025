CWE-113 is a Variant focused on CRLF injection, considered as a potential secondary weakness related to HTTP header manipulation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe693[\"CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure\"]\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe693 -->|PARENT| cwe20\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe693 primary\n    class cwe113 secondary\n    class cwe20 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to set the HTTP response header X-Content-Type-Options to nosniff**, leading to a potential for the browser to misinterpret the content type. This can then lead to content spoofing.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the clear evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the CVE reference. The **rootcause** is the **failure to set the HTTP response header X-Content-Type-Options to nosniff**, which directly relates to a **failure of a protection mechanism**.\n\nThe evidence from the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section:\n-   **rootcause:** **fail to set the HTTP response header X-Content-Type-Options to nosniff**\n\nAnd also this evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section:\n-   The vulnerability exists because OTRS and ((OTRS Community Edition)) **fail to set the HTTP response header** `X-Content-Type-Options` to `nosniff`.\n\nThe retriever results provided several potential CWEs.\n*   CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')) was considered because content spoofing is a form of XSS, but the root cause is not related to neutralization of input.\n*   CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) was mentioned in the CVE reference, but this is a general weakness. The more specific weakness is the protection mechanism failure.\n*   CWE-113 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')) was considered because setting HTTP headers is part of sanitizing the output.\n\nCWE-693 is selected as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **failure to implement a security mechanism** (setting the `X-Content-Type-Options` header). The level of specificity is appropriate as it describes the general class of the **rootcause**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource
