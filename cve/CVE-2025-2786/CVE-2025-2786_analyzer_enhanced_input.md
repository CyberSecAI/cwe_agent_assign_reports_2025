# Vulnerability Description

    A flaw was found in Tempo Operator, where it **creates a ServiceAccount**, **ClusterRole**, **and **ClusterRole**Binding** when a user deploys a TempoStack or TempoMonolithic instance. This flaw allows a user with full access to their namespace to extract the ServiceAccount token and use it to submit TokenReview and SubjectAccessReview requests, potentially revealing information about other users permissions. While this does not allow privilege escalation or impersonation, it exposes information that could aid in gathering information for further attacks.
