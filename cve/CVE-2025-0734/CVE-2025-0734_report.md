Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

### CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
The vulnerability description explicitly states that the vulnerability involves **deserialization**. CWE-502 directly addresses this issue, making it the most relevant CWE. The description of CWE-502 states: "The product deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently ensuring that the resulting data will be valid." This aligns perfectly with the vulnerability.
