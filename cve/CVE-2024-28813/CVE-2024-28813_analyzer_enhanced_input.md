## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in Infinera hiT 7300 5.60.50. Undocumented privileged functions in the @CT management application allow an attacker to activate remote SSH access to the appliance via an unexpected network interface.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **undocumented privileged functions**
- **impact:** activate remote SSH access
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Infinera hiT 7300
- **version:** 5.60.50
- **component:** @CT management application

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Undocumented privileged functions in the @CT management application allow an attacker to activate remote SSH access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The @CT management application contains an undocumented hidden user mode that enables a functionality to expose an SSH remote interface on the Q interface, using a non-standard port and with undocumented high-privileged credentials. The Q interface is intended for management but does not have documented remote SSH access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized remote SSH access to the appliance, potentially leading to full compromise of the system due to the high privileges granted.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by using the undocumented user mode in the @CT management application to enable remote SSH access on the Q interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the @CT management application and be able to interact with its hidden user mode to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker is expected to have high privileges and local network access to the adjacent device.
