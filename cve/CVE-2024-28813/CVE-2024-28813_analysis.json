The Q interface is intended for management but does not have documented remote SSH access.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized remote SSH access to the appliance, potentially leading to full compromise of the system due to the high privileges granted.\n- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by using the undocumented user mode in the @CT management application to enable remote SSH access on the Q interface.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the @CT management application and be able to interact with its hidden user mode to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker is expected to have high privileges and local network access to the adjacent device.",

CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials is a secondary issue because the hidden functionality exposes an SSH remote interface with undocumented high-privileged credentials. CWE-912 is a class, while CWE-798 is a base.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe912[\"CWE-912: Hidden Functionality\"]\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe798 -->|PEEROF| cwe912\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe912 primary\n    class cwe798 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **undocumented privileged functions** (CWE-912), which then leads to the activation of remote SSH access to the appliance via an unexpected network interface. This SSH access uses **hard-coded credentials** (CWE-798), allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized remote access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is the existence of **undocumented privileged functions** within the @CT management application, which aligns with CWE-912 Hidden Functionality. This hidden functionality allows an attacker to activate remote SSH access. The reference to undocumented high-privileged credentials points to CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the **root cause** is **undocumented privileged functions**, which directly corresponds to CWE-912. The subsequent exposure of SSH access using undocumented credentials supports the inclusion of CWE-798.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-912 captures the general existence of hidden, exploitable functionality, while CWE-798 pinpoints the specific issue of using hard-coded credentials within that hidden functionality. Both are relevant and contribute to the overall understanding of the vulnerability.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-912: Hidden Functionality\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains functionality that is not documented, not part of the specification, and not accessible through an interface or command sequence that is obvious to the product's users or administrators.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-269 is commonly misused.
