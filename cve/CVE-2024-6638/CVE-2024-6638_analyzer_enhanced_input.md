## Vulnerability Description
An **integer overflow** vulnerability due to **improper input validation when reading TDMS files** in LabVIEW may result in an infinite loop. Successful exploitation requires an attacker to provide a user with a specially crafted TDMS file. This vulnerability affects LabVIEW 2024 Q1 and prior versions.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper input validation when reading TDMS files**
- **weakness:** **integer overflow**
- **impact:** infinite loop
- **vector:** specially crafted TDMS file
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** LabVIEW
- **version:** 2024 Q1 and prior versions

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow due to improper input validation when reading TDMS files in LabVIEW.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Integer Overflow: The software fails to properly validate the input data when reading TDMS files, leading to an integer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Infinite Loop: A successful exploit can lead to an infinite loop, causing a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  Specially Crafted TDMS File: An attacker needs to provide a user with a malicious TDMS file to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted TDMS file to a user. The user must open the file with the vulnerable LabVIEW software. No specific privileges are required, but user interaction is necessary.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- LabVIEW 2024 Q1 and prior versions.
- Specifically:
    - LabVIEW 2024 Q1
    - LabVIEW 2023
    - LabVIEW 2022
    - LabVIEW 2021 and prior (not in mainstream support)
    - TDM C DLL (not supported)

**Mitigation:**
-  Upgrade to the following versions or later:
    - LabVIEW 2024 Q3
    - LabVIEW 2023 Q3 Patch 5
    - LabVIEW 2022 Q3 Patch 4

**CVSS Score:**
- 5.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)
    -   **AV:L** (Local): The attack vector is local.
    -   **AC:L** (Low): The attack complexity is low.
    -   **PR:N** (None): No privileges are required.
    -   **UI:R** (Required): User interaction is required.
    -   **S:U** (Unchanged): The security scope is unchanged.
    -   **C:N** (None): There is no impact to confidentiality.
    -  **I:N** (None): There is no impact to integrity.
    -   **A:H** (High): There is a high impact on availability.
