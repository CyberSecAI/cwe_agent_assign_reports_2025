## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the `support_unfiltered_files_upload` function. This function is used to allow the upload of unfiltered file types, including SVG files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input during the file upload process, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be embedded within an SVG file. This malicious code is then stored on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** When a user accesses a page where the injected SVG file is displayed, the embedded malicious JavaScript code will execute within the user's browser.
- **Compromised User Accounts:** This vulnerability can be used to perform actions on behalf of the user, steal session cookies, redirect to malicious sites, or perform other unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The primary attack vector is through the file upload functionality, specifically exploiting the ability to upload unfiltered files.
- **SVG File Injection:** An attacker uploads a malicious SVG file containing embedded JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have at least Author-level access to the WordPress site. This allows them to upload files, including the malicious SVG files.
