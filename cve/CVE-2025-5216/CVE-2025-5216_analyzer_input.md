## Analysis of CVE-2025-5216 Content

The provided content relates to CVE-2025-5216. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information extracted from the GitHub issue and the PHPGurukul website:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the 'login' section of the "Students Record Management Project in PHP".
*   The vulnerability is due to the direct use of the 'id' parameter in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access.
*   Sensitive data leakage.
*   Data tampering.
*   Comprehensive system control.
*   Service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The 'id' parameter in the `/login.php` file is vulnerable.
*   Attackers can inject malicious code through this parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.
*   **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.
*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use database accounts with the least necessary privileges.
*   **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.

**Payload Examples (from GitHub issue):**

*   **Time-based blind injection:** `id=ad' AND (SELECT 4658 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))IxsU) AND 'BCvu'='BCvu&password=123456&submit=login`
*   **UNION query:** `id=ad' UNION ALL SELECT 55,CONCAT(0x716b627671,0x424643495050664e794c4b6f6b7177676458486c584945706e4e7a6c597879646766556477697775,0x71716a7a71)-- -&password=123456&submit=login`

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Product:** Students Record Management Project in PHP
*   **Vendor:** phpgurukul.com
*   **Vulnerable File:** `/login.php`
*   **Version:** V3.20
