The vulnerability arises from the workflows explicit checkout and execution of code from a fork, which is unsafe as it allows the running of untrusted code in an environment with access to push to the base repository and access secrets. This flaw could lead to the exfiltration of sensitive secrets such as GITHUB_TOKEN, HF_TOKEN, VERCEL_ORG_ID, VERCEL_PROJECT_ID, COMMENT_TOKEN, AWSACCESSKEYID, AWSSECRETKEY, and VERCEL_TOKEN.
