  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-46966\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe application `mn.ikhgur.khotoch` (Video Downloader Pro & Browser) for Android improperly handles user-provided input when generating code, leading to a code injection vulnerability. Specifically, the `MainActivity` component is vulnerable.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code (Code Injection):** The application fails to sanitize or validate input, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable application's WebView.\n- **Escalation of Privileges:** The vulnerability can potentially lead to an escalation of privileges.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- **Crafted Intent:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted intent to the vulnerable application. The crafted intent contains malicious JavaScript code that is executed within the WebView component.\n- **Remote Attack:** The attack can be performed remotely.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs the ability to send intents to the target application, meaning they would likely need to have a separate application or tool to do so.\n- The attacker does not need to be on the same device, making this a remote vulnerability.",
