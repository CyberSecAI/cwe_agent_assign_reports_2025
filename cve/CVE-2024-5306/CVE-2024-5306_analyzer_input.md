# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-5306

## Vulnerability Description
Kofax Power PDF PDF File Parsing Memory Corruption Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Kofax Power PDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PDF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a **memory corruption** condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-22930.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided advisory, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of PDF files within Kofax Power PDF. This inadequate validation leads to a memory corruption condition.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is insufficient input validation, specifically regarding data present in a PDF file. This leads to a memory corruption vulnerability.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
* **Attack Vectors:** The primary attack vector involves a malicious PDF file. The victim must open this specially crafted file in Kofax Power PDF to trigger the vulnerability. Alternatively, user interaction can be through a malicious page which leads to the opening of a malicious PDF.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs the capability to create a malicious PDF file and deliver it to the target user. They need the target user to open the malicious PDF in Kofax Power PDF.
