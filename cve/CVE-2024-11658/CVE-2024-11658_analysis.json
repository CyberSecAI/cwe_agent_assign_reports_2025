  "description": "A vulnerability has been found in EnGenius ENH1350EXT, ENS500-AC and ENS620EXT up to 20241118 and classified as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file /admin/network/ajax_getChannelList. The manipulation of the argument countryCode leads to **command injection**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the `ajax_getChannelList` interface of ENGENIUS routers. Specifically, the `countryCode` parameter, which is received via an HTTP GET request, is directly passed to the `iwpriv_SetGreenMode` function without proper filtering or escaping.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Command Injection:** The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands within the `countryCode` parameter. This is because the value is concatenated directly into a system command executed by the router's firmware.\n*   The `iwpriv_SetGreenMode` function is used to set the country code and other parameters related to Wi-Fi, but it does not properly sanitize the input leading to the vulnerability.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying system with root privileges, potentially gaining full control of the router.\n*   **System Compromise:** An attacker can manipulate the router's configuration, install malware, establish backdoors, exfiltrate sensitive information, and perform other malicious actions.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=.../admin/network/ajax_getChannelList` endpoint.\n*   **`countryCode` Parameter:** The malicious command is injected within the `countryCode` parameter of the GET request.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be logged into the device's administration interface. This suggests that the vulnerability is exploitable by an authenticated user, not necessarily a remote unauthenticated one.\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface to send the malicious HTTP request.\n*   **Knowledge of the API endpoint:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable API endpoint `/admin/network/ajax_getChannelList`.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The provided content includes a sample HTTP request demonstrating the vulnerability. The injected command is a `curl` command that will make a DNS request to `ovnezs0so8rjlwqo2bx04jbolfr6fxfl4.oastify.com` that can be used to verify that the command execution is succesful.\n*   The vulnerability is present in multiple Engenius router models and all firmware versions according to the report, including the latest one.\n*   The report indicates that the vendor was contacted but did not respond.",

CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77, but CWE-78 is a more specific Base level. The analysis selected the more specific CWE-78.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper neutralization** of the `countryCode` parameter. This leads directly to **command injection**, allowing arbitrary commands to be executed on the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **command injection** due to **improper neutralization** of the `countryCode` parameter in the `/admin/network/ajax_getChannelList` file. The `countryCode` parameter is directly passed to the `iwpriv_SetGreenMode` function without proper filtering or escaping, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands. The high retriever score for CWE-78, combined with the clear description of OS command injection, supports this selection. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-78 is more specific and appropriate than its parent, CWE-77. The evidence for command injection is strong and direct based on the **Vulnerability Description Key Phrases** and **CVE Reference Links Content Summary**. The selection of CWE-78 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it accurately reflects the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
