This can lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, cookie theft, and defacement of web pages, potentially leading to complete compromise of the Jenkins instance and its users.\n- **Attack vectors:**  An attacker with View/Create permission can inject malicious JavaScript code into the view name through the Simple Queue Plugin. When another user views the queue with the maliciously crafted name, the injected JavaScript will be executed.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires View/Create permission to exploit this vulnerability. They must be able to create or edit a view within the Simple Queue plugin. They also require the victim to view the created or edited view.",

While other related CWEs were considered, CWE-79 directly addresses the **improper neutralization of input** leading to a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability, making it the most specific and relevant choice. The parent-child relationships of CWE-79 to other CWEs related to encoding and escaping were considered, but none were more appropriate than CWE-79 itself.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe80[\"CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\"]\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n\n    cwe80 -->|CHILDOF| cwe79\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe80,cwe113 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to escape the view name**, leading to a stored **cross-site scripting** vulnerability.\n  - Root Cause: **Improper Neutralization of Input** (CWE-79)\n  - Impact: Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser session.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which explicitly states that the Jenkins Simple Queue Plugin does not escape the view name, resulting in a stored **cross-site scripting** (XSS) vulnerability. The **root cause** is the **improper neutralization of input**, which directly corresponds to CWE-79. The retriever results also listed CWE-79 as a relevant CWE, further supporting this classification. The relationship analysis confirmed that CWE-79 is the most specific and appropriate choice, given the available information.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
