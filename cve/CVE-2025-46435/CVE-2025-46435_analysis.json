The application does not neutralize user-controllable input before placing it in a web page served to other users, leading to XSS. |\n| CWE-352 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | 0.9 | Compound | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability is exploitable because of a CSRF **weakness** that allows a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship to consider is that CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] allows for a malicious actor to force a higher privileged user to execute unwanted actions, which, in this case, leads to Stored XSS (CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]).

This allows an attacker to force a privileged user to perform actions that inject malicious scripts. The scripts are then improperly neutralized, leading to **Stored XSS** (CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability\" and \"Stored XSS\". The retriever results also list CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] and CWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] as top candidates.
