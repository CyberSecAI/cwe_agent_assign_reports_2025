It represents a high-level category of missing authorization checks. There are several potential child CWEs that could provide more specific details, but the description doesn't offer sufficient evidence to determine which child CWE would be most appropriate.

This is a Class-level CWE, and while more specific Base or Variant CWEs might exist, the provided information doesn't allow for a more granular classification. The impact of this **missing authorization** is that users with Overall/Read permissions can enumerate ALM server names, usernames, and client IDs, effectively bypassing intended access controls.\n\nThe Retriever Results also support this classification, with CWE-862 being the top result. The CWE Classification Guidance highlights that CWE-862 is appropriate when there is \"No role/privilege check after login.\" This aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description, which indicates that permission checks are missing.\n\nOther CWEs were considered but ultimately deemed less appropriate:\n\n*   CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization): This CWE implies that an authorization check is present but flawed. The description states that permission checks are missing, so CWE-862 is more accurate.\n*   CWE-280 (Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges): Although potentially related, this CWE focuses on the *handling* of insufficient privileges, whereas the core issue here is the *absence* of permission checks.\n*   CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment): This could be a secondary issue if the \"Overall/Read\" permission is too broad, but the primary problem is the lack of checks for those permissions.\n\nThe decision to use CWE-862 is primarily based on the explicit mention of \"**missing permission checks**\" in the vulnerability description. This aligns with the definition of CWE-862, the Retriever Results, and the CWE Classification Guidance. While other CWEs might be indirectly relevant, they are not as directly supported by the evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-862: Missing Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 2069.16\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate",
