# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-1866

## Vulnerability Description
**Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer** vulnerability in warmcat libwebsockets allows Pointer Manipulation, potentially leading to out-of-bounds memory access. This issue affects libwebsockets before 4.3.4 and is present in code built specifically for the Win32 platform. By default, the affected code is not executed unless one of the following conditions is met LWS_WITHOUT_EXTENSIONS (default ON) is manually set to OFF in CMake. LWS_WITH_HTTP_STREAM_COMPRESSION (default OFF) is manually set to ON in CMake. Despite these conditions, when triggered in affected configurations, this vulnerability may allow attackers to manipulate pointers, potentially leading to memory corruption or unexpected behavior.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **rootcause:** **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**
- **weakness:** **memory corruption, out-of-bounds memory access**
- **product:** warmcat libwebsockets
- **impact:** ['out-of-bounds memory access', 'unexpected behavior']
- **version:** before 4.3.4

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-1866 Content

The provided content relates to a fix for a potential vulnerability in the zlib library, as used within the libwebsockets project. It addresses a security audit recommendation from Trail of Bits and TrustInSoft, made in support of the Mozilla Foundation.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an "offset pointer optimization" in `inftrees.c`. This optimization involved subtracting an offset from a pointer to an array to allow indexing starting at that offset. This practice is not compliant with the C standard, as the behavior of a pointer decremented before its allocated memory is undefined.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Undefined Behavior:** The code exhibited undefined behavior according to the C standard.
*   **Potential for Exploitation:** While not explicitly stated, undefined behavior can potentially lead to exploitable vulnerabilities (e.g., crashes, memory corruption).

**Impact of exploitation:**

The impact is not explicitly detailed, but the removal of the optimization aims to avoid the *possibility* of undefined behavior, which could lead to crashes or other security issues.

**Attack vectors:**

The attack vector is not specified. The vulnerability is related to how memory is accessed, so a crafted input that triggers the problematic code path could potentially lead to an exploit.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

The required attacker capabilities are not specified.

**Mitigation or fix:**

The fix involves removing the "offset pointer optimization" in `inftrees.c`. Specifically, the code changes involve:

*   Replacing `end` with `match`
*   Removing the subtraction of offsets from pointers (e.g., removing `- base -= 257;` and `- extra -= 257;`)
*   Adjusting conditional checks to use `match` instead of `end`.
*   Adjusting indexing into `extra` and `base` to account for the removal of the offset.

**More detail than official CVE description:**

Yes, this content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It explains the specific code change, the reasoning behind it (security audit recommendation), and the nature of the undefined behavior being addressed. It also provides the specific lines of code that were modified.
