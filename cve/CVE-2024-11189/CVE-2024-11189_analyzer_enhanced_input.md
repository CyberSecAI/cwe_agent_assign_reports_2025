## Vulnerability Description
The Social Share And Social Locker WordPress plugin before 1.4.2 **does not sanitise and escape some of its settings**, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## CVE-2024-11189 Analysis

This content **relates** to CVE-2024-11189. It provides detailed information about a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Social Share And Social Locker ‚Äì ARSocial plugin.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   Insufficient input validation/sanitization

**Impact of exploitation:**

High privilege users (such as admins) can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code into the Facebook App Id field within the "Social Network Configuration" section of the plugin's global settings page (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=arsocial-lite-global-settings`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Administrative privileges within the WordPress installation.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.4.2 of the plugin.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   **Proof of Concept:** The provided PoC demonstrates how to inject a simple `<script>alert(2)</script>` payload into the Facebook App Id field, triggering an alert box upon page reload.
*   **CVSS Score:** 3.5 (Low)
*   **CWE:** CWE-79
*   **OWASP Top 10:** A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Researcher:** Bob Matyas
*   **Timeline:** Publicly Published: 2024-11-09, Added to WPScan: 2025-02-25, Last Updated: 2025-02-25.
*   **Verification:** The vulnerability has been verified.
*   **WPVDB ID:** f3d1473a-6d25-447d-af27-f315323fdd62.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set ‚Äì Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* üîç *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* üîç *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion ‚Äì CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### üî∏ CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúA user created with the ‚Äòguest‚Äô role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúThe backup service runs as root but only needs read access.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### üî∏ CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúUser can access another user‚Äôs invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.‚Äù*

## Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *‚ÄúUser can escalate privileges to admin.‚Äù*
> ‚ùå Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged ‚Äì only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ‚úÖ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

## Good Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privileges & Permissions

* ‚úÖ **CWE-266**: *‚ÄúWhen a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.‚Äù*
* ‚úÖ **CWE-250**: *‚ÄúInstaller runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.‚Äù*
* ‚úÖ **CWE-284**: *‚ÄúInconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.‚Äù*
* ‚úÖ **CWE-285**: *‚ÄúAuthorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.‚Äù*
