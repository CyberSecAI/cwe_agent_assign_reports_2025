# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-10584
## Query
The DirectoryPress Business Directory And Classified Ad Listing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.16 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file. When DirectoryPress Frontend is installed, this can be exploited by unauthenticated users.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'insufficient input sanitization', 'output escaping'
- **weakness**: 'Stored Cross-Site Scripting'
