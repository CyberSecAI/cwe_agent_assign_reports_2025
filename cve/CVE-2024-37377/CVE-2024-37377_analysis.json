CWE-122 is a variant of CWE-119 and provides a more specific classification for heap-based buffer overflows.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe122[\"CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe122 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe122 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a **heap-based buffer overflow** (CWE-122) leading to a denial of service. The root cause is the **improper** handling of memory allocation on the heap, and the impact is a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates a **heap-based buffer overflow**. The phrase \"**heap-based buffer overflow**\" is a strong indicator for CWE-122. The retriever results also list CWE-122 as a potential match. Given this direct evidence, I am confident in assigning CWE-122 as the primary CWE.\n\nCWE-119 was considered because it is a more general class of buffer overflows. However, since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"heap-based\", CWE-122 is a more specific and appropriate choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
