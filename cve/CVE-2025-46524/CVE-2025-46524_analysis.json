CWE-352 is a compound weakness, reflecting multiple underlying causes, while CWE-79 is a base weakness describing the XSS vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe352\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing CSRF protection** (CWE-352). This **weakness** allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious scripts, leading to Stored XSS (CWE-79).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary **rootcause** is the **missing CSRF protection** which is CWE-352. The secondary **weakness** is the resulting Stored XSS, which is CWE-79. The evidence for this is found in the \"**Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**\" which explicitly calls out \"**missing CSRF protection**\" and \"**CSRF, XSS**\".
