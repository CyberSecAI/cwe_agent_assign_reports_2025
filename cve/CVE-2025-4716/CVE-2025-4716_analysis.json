It provides more detail than a standard CVE description.\n\nHere's the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nAttackers inject malicious code from the 'prod\\_name' parameter and use it directly in SQL queries without appropriate cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nSQL injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nUnauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and service interruption.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe '/pages/credit\\_transaction\\_add.php' file, specifically the 'prod\\_name' parameter. No login or authorization is required.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nNo specific position or privileges are required; the vulnerability is exploitable without authentication.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n1. Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n2. Input validation and filtering.\n3. Minimize database user permissions.\n4. Regular security audits.\n\n**Payload examples:**\nSeveral payloads are provided for boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind SQL injection attacks using tools like sqlmap. Example:\n`prod_name=15' RLIKE (SELECT (CASE WHEN (7549=7549) THEN 15 ELSE 0x28 END))-- HVPJ&cid=2&qty=111&addtocart=`\n\n**Affected Version:**\nV1.0",

The **weakness** is **SQL Injection** in the `prod_name` parameter. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of the vulnerability description to the characteristics of CWE-89. While other CWEs were considered, none aligned as directly with the described **SQL Injection** vulnerability. There are no parent-child relationships at play here.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of the following:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper Neutralization** of user-supplied input (`prod_name`) in an SQL query (CWE-89).\n2.  **Impact:** Unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and service interruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence which explicitly states that the **weakness** is **SQL Injection** due to the **improper neutralization** of the `prod_name` parameter. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary reinforces this by stating, \"Attackers inject malicious code from the 'prod\\_name' parameter and use it directly in SQL queries without appropriate cleaning or validation,\" and that the **weakness** is **SQL injection**. This aligns directly with CWE-89, which describes the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an SQL command, leading to **SQL Injection**. The retriever results also show that CWE-89 is the best match. Therefore, CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
