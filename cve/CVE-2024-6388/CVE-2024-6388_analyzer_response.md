# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2024-6388

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-214 | Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The token was exposed as a command line argument. |
| CWE-497 | Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The token was exposed to unprivileged users. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing my decision was the direct match of CWE-214's description to the vulnerability details. CWE-497 was a secondary consideration because it highlights the aspect of unauthorized access to sensitive information. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, representing the specific weaknesses directly observed.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect invocation** of the `pro` client by the `ubuntu-advantage-desktop-daemon`, where the Ubuntu Pro attach token was passed as a command-line argument (CWE-214). This led to the **exposure of sensitive information** (the Pro token) to unprivileged users (CWE-497). The impact of this exposure could allow an attacker to attach to the Ubuntu Pro service with the permissions associated with the leaked token, potentially leading to unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is the **invocation of a process using visible sensitive information**, specifically the Ubuntu Pro token being passed as a command-line argument. This aligns directly with CWE-214. The vulnerability description explicitly states that the daemon was passing the token as an argument in plaintext, and the CVE reference details that the token was exposed via command-line arguments. The retriever results list CWE-214 as the top combined result.

The secondary weakness is the **exposure of sensitive system information to an unauthorized control sphere**. This aligns with CWE-497, as the Pro token was exposed to unprivileged users.

The relationship graph shows the connection between these two CWEs. They are not directly related through parent-child or peer relationships, but both contribute to the overall vulnerability.

The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-214 directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, while CWE-497 describes the impact of the exposed information.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-214: Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A process is invoked with sensitive command-line arguments, environment variables, or other elements that can be seen by other processes on the operating system.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.
