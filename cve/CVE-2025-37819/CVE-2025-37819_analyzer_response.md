# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-37819

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-416 | Use After Free | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly states "**Prevent use after free**" |
| CWE-762 | Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. Related to resource management issues, as the memory being freed was still in use. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the decision is the direct match of "Use After Free" (CWE-416) with the vulnerability description's root cause. While other CWEs like CWE-415 (Double Free) and CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime) are related to memory management, CWE-416 directly addresses the specific problem described. The hierarchical relationships show that CWE-416 is a variant, providing a more specific classification than its parent classes.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a coding error where a callback function `gicv2m_get_fwnode()` is incorrectly marked as `__init`, leading to it being freed prematurely. This results in a **use after free** condition when the PCI subsystem invokes the callback, ultimately causing a kernel paging request error.

Root Cause: Incorrectly marking `gicv2m_get_fwnode()` as `__init` -> Premature freeing of the function -> **Use After Free** (CWE-416) -> Kernel paging request error (impact).

## Summary of Analysis
The primary CWE, CWE-416 (Use After Free), is directly supported by the vulnerability description, which explicitly states "**Prevent use after free**". The high retriever score for related memory management CWEs further reinforces this assessment. The selection of CWE-416 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it precisely captures the nature of the vulnerability. The evidence is strong, and the confidence is high.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.



## CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs multiple related behaviors, but the behaviors are performed in the wrong order in ways which may produce resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
If two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.

**Mapping Guidance**:
