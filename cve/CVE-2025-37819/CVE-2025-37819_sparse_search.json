But, the call back is wrongly marked as __init, causing it to be freed, while being registered with the PCI subsystem and could trigger Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffff8000816c0400 gicv2m_get_fwnode+0x0/0x58 (P) pci_set_bus_msi_domain+0x74/0x88 pci_register_host_bridge+0x194/0x548 This is easily reproducible on a Juno board with ACPI boot. Retain the function for later use.",
