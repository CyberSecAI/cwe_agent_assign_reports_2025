  "description": "liboqs is a C-language cryptographic library that provides implementations of post-quantum cryptography algorithms. A correctness error has been identified in the reference implementation of the HQC key encapsulation mechanism. Due to an **indexing error**, part of the secret key is incorrectly treated as non-secret data. This results in an incorrect shared secret value being returned when the decapsulation function is called with a malformed ciphertext. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.12.0.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-54137:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The root cause lies in an indexing error within the reference implementation of the HQC (Hamming Quasi-Cyclic) Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM). Specifically, during decapsulation, part of the secret key, intended to be a field called `sigma`, is incorrectly treated as part of the public key. This happens because the logic to retrieve the public key from the secret key in the decapsulation function was not updated after a `sigma` field was added to the secret key structure to enable implicit rejection of malformed ciphertexts.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n1.  **Incorrect Secret Key Handling:** A portion of the secret key (`sigma`) is mistakenly treated as part of the public key during decapsulation.\n2.  **Flawed Comparison Check:** A faulty comparison check allows the error to propagate undetected, which causes the decapsulation function to fail to use `sigma` for implicit rejection of malformed ciphertexts.\n3. **Implicit Rejection Bypass:** Due to the aforementioned errors, the decapsulation function accepts malformed ciphertexts, resulting in the generation of incorrect shared secrets.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- The vulnerability causes the decapsulation function to return an incorrect shared secret when called with a malformed ciphertext. Although no concrete attack is mentioned, this mishandling of the secret key is a security vulnerability because it could potentially allow an attacker to recover the secret key or use it for other attacks.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The attack vector is network-based (`AV:N`), meaning an attacker can be remote.\n- The attack complexity is high (`AC:H`).\n- No privileges are needed (`PR:N`) and no user interaction is required (`UI:N`).\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs the ability to create a malformed ciphertext, and can do this remotely.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerability is present in versions of liboqs prior to 0.12.0, and is fixed in version 0.12.0 and later.\n- The error was reported to the maintainers of the HQC reference implementation.\n- The vulnerability was identified by C\u00e9lian Gl\u00e9naz and Dahmun Goudarzi (Quarkslab).\n- The CVSS score is 7.4, indicating a high severity vulnerability.\n- The vulnerability affects confidentiality and integrity, but not availability.\n\n**CVSS v3 Base Metrics:**\n- Attack Vector: Network (N)\n- Attack Complexity: High (H)\n- Privileges Required: None (N)\n- User Interaction: None (N)\n- Scope: Unchanged (U)\n- Confidentiality: High (H)\n- Integrity: High (H)\n- Availability: None (N)\n- CVSS Score: 7.4\n- CVSS String: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N",
