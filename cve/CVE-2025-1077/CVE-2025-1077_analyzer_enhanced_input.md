## Vulnerability Description
A security vulnerability has been identified in the IBL Software Engineering Visual Weather and derived products (NAMIS, Aero Weather, Satellite Weather). The vulnerability is present in the Product Delivery Service (PDS) component in specific server configurations where the PDS pipeline utilizes the IPDS pipeline with Message Editor Output Filters enabled. A remote unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to send unauthenticated requests to execute the IPDS pipeline with specially crafted Form Properties, enabling remote execution of arbitrary Python code. This vulnerability could lead to a full system compromise of the affected server, particularly if Visual Weather services are run under a privileged user accountcontrary to the documented installation best practices. Upgrade to the patched versions 7.3.10 (or higher), 8.6.0 (or higher).

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** full system compromise and remote code execution
- **vector:** unauthenticated requests with specially crafted Form Properties
- **attacker:** remote unauthenticated attacker
- **product:** IBL Software Engineering Visual Weather and derived products
- **component:** Product Delivery Service (PDS) component

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## CVE-2025-1077 Analysis

**1. Verification:**

The content directly addresses CVE-2025-1077, detailing a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in IBL Software's Visual Weather Product Delivery Service (PDS).

**2. Relevant Content Extraction:**

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is triggered in server configurations where the PDS pipeline utilizes the IPDS pipeline with Message Editor Output Filters enabled. Attackers can craft malicious requests with specific Form Properties.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to unauthenticated requests to the IPDS pipeline with crafted Form Properties.
* **Impact of exploitation:**  Full Server Compromise, particularly if Visual Weather services are run under a privileged user account.
* **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted requests to the PDS pipeline.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  No authentication required, attacker needs to be able to send requests to the PDS pipeline endpoint.
* **Mitigation or fix:**
    * **Update:** Upgrade to Visual Weather 7.3.10 or higher, or Visual Weather 8.6.0 or higher.
    * **Temporary Mitigation:**
        1. Disable PDS pipelines utilizing IPDS pipelines in server configurations.
        2. Ensure Visual Weather services are not run under a privileged user account.
        3. Restrict network access to the PDS pipeline endpoint to trusted IP ranges.

**3. Additional Details:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 8.1 High (Base Score) / 7.5 High (Overall)
*   **Affected Products:** Visual Weather 8.2.5, 7.3.9, 7.3.6 (Enterprise Build), 8.5.2 (Enterprise Build), and derived products (NAMIS, Aero Weather, Satellite Weather) using the same versions.
*   **Acknowledgment:** The vulnerability was reported by Ianis BERNARD (NCIA).
