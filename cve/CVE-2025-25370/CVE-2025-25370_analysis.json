CWE-201, a parent of CWE-212, addresses the broader issue of **inserting sensitive information** into sent data, which is relevant because the notification content itself is sensitive information being displayed inappropriately. CWE-451, while a Class-level CWE, relates to the **misrepresentation of critical information** in the UI, which is relevant because the lock screen's function of protecting privacy is being undermined. The relationship of CWE-212 being a specific type of CWE-201 helped refine the selection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe451[\"CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\"]\n    \n    cwe212 -->|CHILDOF| cwe669[\"CWE-669: Incorrect Behavior Order: \u0449\u0435 \u0441\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\"]\n    cwe212 -->|CHILDOF| cwe669\n    cwe212 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe201\n    cwe201 -->|PARENTOF| cwe598[\"CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method For Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe212 primary\n    class cwe201,cwe451 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to properly remove sensitive notification data (CWE-212)** before it's displayed on the lock screen. This leads to the **insertion of sensitive information (CWE-201)** into the displayed data. The impact is a **UI misrepresentation (CWE-451)**, where the user is led to believe their information is private when it's not.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis heavily relies on the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" which provides crucial details about the root cause and impact of the vulnerability. The vulnerability involves notification content being displayed on the lock screen, bypassing privacy settings. This directly aligns with CWE-212 (**Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer**), as the system **fails to remove** sensitive data from notifications before displaying them on the lock screen. The relationship between CWE-212 and CWE-201 (**Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data**) reinforces the selection, as the **failure to remove information** directly leads to it being **inserted** into the displayed notification. CWE-451 (**User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information**) is considered because the lock screen is intended to protect privacy, and this vulnerability misrepresents the security of the device. However, it is not as direct a fit as CWE-212. The choice of CWE-212 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
