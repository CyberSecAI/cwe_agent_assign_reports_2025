However, the runtime suspend callback will wait to flush ufshcd_rtc_work, causing a **deadlock**.

No specific attacker action is needed to trigger the bug.\\n\\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\\n- No specific attacker capabilities or position is required. The vulnerability can be triggered by the system itself.\\n\\n**Technical Details:**\\n- The fix replaces `ufshcd_rpm_put_sync()` with `ufshcd_rpm_put()`. The `ufshcd_rpm_put` function does not wait for the power management operation to complete synchronously, avoiding the deadlock.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n- The fix was backported to stable kernel versions, including 6.11.x.\\n- The issue was introduced by commit `6bf999e0eb41 (\"scsi: ufs: core: Add UFS RTC support\")`.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '667', 'name': 'Improper Locking', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(323.82185881457923)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '833', 'name': 'Deadlock', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(297.04549189459004)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '835', 'name': \"Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')\", 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(235.8196442795855)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '663', 'name': 'Use of a Non-reentrant Function in a Concurrent Context', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(234.22023681013323)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '61', 'name': 'UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(229.47555281837066)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '413', 'name': 'Improper Resource Locking', 'type': 'Base', 'original_content': 'The product does not lock or does not correctly lock a resource when the product must have exclusive access to the resource.', 'keyphrase_source': 'weakness:deadlock', 'source': 'dense', 'mapping_notes': {'usage': 'Allowed', 'rationale': 'This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.', 'comments': \"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2009-0935: Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice\n\n- CVE-2010-4210: function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.\n\n- CVE-2008-4302: Chain: OS kernel does not properly handle a failure of a function call (CWE-755), leading to an unlock of a resource that was not locked (CWE-832), with resultant crash.\n\n- CVE-2009-1243: OS kernel performs an unlock in some incorrect circumstances, leading to panic.\n\n- CVE-2009-2857: OS deadlock\n\n- CVE-2009-1961: OS deadlock involving 3 separate functions\n\n- CVE-2009-2699: deadlock in library\n\n- CVE-2009-4272: deadlock triggered by packets that force collisions in a routing table\n\n- CVE-2002-1850: read/write deadlock between web server and script\n\n- CVE-2004-0174: web server deadlock involving multiple listening connections\n\n- CVE-2009-1388: multiple simultaneous calls to the same function trigger deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2006-5158: chain: other weakness leads to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) or deadlock (CWE-833).\n\n- CVE-2006-4342: deadlock when an operation is performed on a resource while it is being removed.\n\n- CVE-2006-2374: Deadlock in device driver triggered by using file handle of a related device.\n\n- CVE-2006-2275: Deadlock when large number of small messages cannot be processed quickly enough.\n\n- CVE-2005-3847: OS kernel has deadlock triggered by a signal during a core dump.\n\n- CVE-2005-3106: Race condition leads to deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2005-2456: Chain: array index error (CWE-129) leads to deadlock (CWE-833)\n\n- CVE-2001-0682: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a mutex.\n\n- CVE-2002-1914: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.\n\n- CVE-2002-1915: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.\n\n- CVE-2002-0051: Critical file can be opened with exclusive read access by user, preventing application of security policy. Possibly related to improper permissions, large-window race condition.\n\n- CVE-2000-0338: Chain: predictable file names used for locking, allowing attacker to create the lock beforehand. Resultant from permissions and randomness.\n\n- CVE-2000-1198: Chain: Lock files with predictable names. Resultant from randomness.\n\n- CVE-2002-1869: Product does not check if it can write to a log file, allowing attackers to avoid logging by accessing the file using an exclusive lock. Overlaps unchecked error condition. This is not quite CWE-412, but close.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0529: In memory management driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android SoCAndroid ID: A-185195268\n\n- CVE-2021-0625: In ccu, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS05594996; Issue ID: ALPS05594996.\n\n- CVE-2020-27014: Trend Micro Antivirus for Mac 2020 (Consumer) contains a race condition vulnerability in the Web Threat Protection Blocklist component, that if exploited, could allow an attacker to case a kernel panic or crash.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAn attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: A race condition was addressed with improved locking. This issue is fixed in macOS Big Sur 11.2, Security Update 2021-001 Catalina, Security Update 2021-001 Mojave, watchOS 7.3, tvOS 14.4, iOS 14.4 and iPadOS 14.4. A malicious application may be able to elevate privileges. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited..\n\n- CVE-2021-31961: Windows InstallService Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26708: A local privilege escalation was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.10.13. Multiple race conditions in the AF_VSOCK implementation are caused by wrong locking in net/vmw_vsock/af_vsock.c. The race conditions were implicitly introduced in the commits that added VSOCK multi-transport support.\n\n- CVE-2021-0330: In add_user_ce and remove_user_ce of storaged.cpp, there is a possible use-after-free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in storaged with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-9 Android-10 Android-11Android ID: A-170732441\n\n- CVE-2021-0940: In TBD of TBD, there is a possible out of bounds write due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in the kernel with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-171315276References: N/A\n\n- CVE-2021-26312: Failure to flush the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) of the I/O memory management unit (IOMMU) may lead an IO device to write to memory it should not be able to access, resulting in a potential loss of integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-29509: Puma is a concurrent HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications. The fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris). The fix is very small and a git patch is available for those using unsupported versions of Puma.\n\n- CVE-2021-4001: A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's ebpf verifier between bpf_map_update_elem and bpf_map_freeze due to a missing lock in kernel/bpf/syscall.c. In this flaw, a local user with a special privilege (cap_sys_admin or cap_bpf) can modify the frozen mapped address space. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.16 rc2.\n\n- CVE-2021-41141: PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in the C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In various parts of PJSIP, when error/failure occurs, it is found that the function returns without releasing the currently held locks. This could result in a system deadlock, which cause a denial of service for the users. No release has yet been made which contains the linked fix commit. All versions up to an including 2.11.1 are affected. Users may need to manually apply the patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-4149: A vulnerability was found in btrfs_alloc_tree_b in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c in the Linux kernel due to an improper lock operation in btrfs. In this flaw, a user with a local privilege may cause a denial of service (DOS) due to a deadlock problem.\n\n- CVE-2022-20016: In vow driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking.

This issue is fixed in macOS Monterey 12.5, macOS Big Sur 11.6.8, Security Update 2022-005 Catalina. An app may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.\n\n- CVE-2022-39131: In camera driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local denial of service in kernel.\n\n- CVE-2022-42775: In camera driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local denial of service in kernel.\n\n- CVE-2022-26356: Racy interactions between dirty vram tracking and paging log dirty hypercalls Activation of log dirty mode done by XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram (was named HVMOP_track_dirty_vram before Xen 4.9) is racy with ongoing log dirty hypercalls. A suitably timed call to XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram can enable log dirty while another CPU is still in the process of tearing down the structures related to a previously enabled log dirty mode (XEN_DOMCTL_SHADOW_OP_OFF). This is due to lack of mutually exclusive locking between both operations and can lead to entries being added in already freed slots, resulting in a memory leak.\n\n- CVE-2021-0147: Improper locking in the Power Management Controller (PMC) for some Intel Chipset firmware before versions pmc_fw_lbg_c1-21ww02a and pmc_fw_lbg_b0-21ww02a may allow a privileged user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-39640: In __dwc3_gadget_ep0_queue of ep0.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to improper locking.

This vulnerability is due to a deadlock condition in the code when processing COPS packets under certain conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending COPS packets with high burst rates to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the CPU to consume excessive resources, which prevents other control plane processes from obtaining resources and results in a DoS.\n\n- CVE-2021-20291: A deadlock vulnerability was found in 'github.com/containers/storage' in versions before 1.28.1. When a container image is processed, each layer is unpacked using `tar`. If one of those layers is not a valid `tar` archive this causes an error leading to an unexpected situation where the code indefinitely waits for the tar unpacked stream, which never finishes. An attacker could use this vulnerability to craft a malicious image, which when downloaded and stored by an application using containers/storage, would then cause a deadlock leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n- CVE-2021-28951: An issue was discovered in fs/io_uring.c in the Linux kernel through 5.11.8. It allows attackers to cause a denial of service (deadlock) because exit may be waiting to park a SQPOLL thread, but concurrently that SQPOLL thread is waiting for a signal to start, aka CID-3ebba796fa25.\n\n- CVE-2021-31611: The Bluetooth Classic implementation on Zhuhai Jieli AC690X and AC692X devices does not properly handle an out-of-order LMP Setup procedure that is followed by a malformed LMP packet, allowing attackers in radio range to deadlock a device via a crafted LMP packet. The user needs to manually reboot the device to restore communication.\n\n- CVE-2021-31785: The Bluetooth Classic implementation on Actions ATS2815 and ATS2819 chipsets does not properly handle the reception of multiple LMP_host_connection_req packets, allowing attackers in radio range to trigger a denial of service (deadlock) of the device via crafted LMP packets. Manual user intervention is required to restart the device and restore Bluetooth communication.\n\n- CVE-2021-38203: btrfs in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (deadlock) via processes that trigger allocation of new system chunks during times when there is a shortage of free space in the system space_info.\n\n- CVE-2021-31786: The Bluetooth Classic Audio implementation on Actions ATS2815 and ATS2819 devices does not properly handle a connection attempt from a host with the same BDAddress as the current connected BT host, allowing attackers to trigger a disconnection and deadlock of the device by connecting with a forged BDAddress that matches the original connected host.\n\n- CVE-2021-3499: A vulnerability was found in OVN Kubernetes in versions up to and including 0.3.0 where the Egress Firewall does not reliably apply firewall rules when there is multiple DNS rules. It could lead to potentially lose of confidentiality, integrity or availability of a service.\n\n- CVE-2021-3735: A deadlock issue was found in the AHCI controller device of QEMU. It occurs on a software reset (ahci_reset_port) while handling a host-to-device Register FIS (Frame Information Structure) packet from the guest. A privileged user inside the guest could use this flaw to hang the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-43395: An issue was discovered in illumos before f859e7171bb5db34321e45585839c6c3200ebb90, OmniOS Community Edition r151038, OpenIndiana Hipster 2021.04, and SmartOS 20210923. A local unprivileged user can cause a deadlock and kernel panic via crafted rename and rmdir calls on tmpfs filesystems. Oracle Solaris 10 and 11 is also affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-31621: MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. In extra/mariabackup/ds_xbstream.cc, when an error occurs (stream_ctxt->dest_file == NULL) while executing the method xbstream_open, the held lock is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock. Note: The vendor argues this is just an improper locking bug and not a vulnerability with adverse effects.\n\n- CVE-2022-31622: MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. In extra/mariabackup/ds_compress.cc, when an error occurs (pthread_create returns a nonzero value) while executing the method create_worker_threads, the held lock is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock. Note: The vendor argues this is just an improper locking bug and not a vulnerability with adverse effects.\n\n- CVE-2022-31623: MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. In extra/mariabackup/ds_compress.cc, when an error occurs (i.e., going to the err label) while executing the method create_worker_threads, the held lock thd->ctrl_mutex is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock. Note: The vendor argues this is just an improper locking bug and not a vulnerability with adverse effects.\n\n- CVE-2022-31624: MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. While executing the plugin/server_audit/server_audit.c method log_statement_ex, the held lock lock_bigbuffer is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2022-38791: In MariaDB before 10.9.2, compress_write in extra/mariabackup/ds_compress.cc does not release data_mutex upon a stream write failure, which allows local users to trigger a deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2022-42328: Guests can trigger deadlock in Linux netback driver T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] The patch for XSA-392 introduced another issue which might result in a deadlock when trying to free the SKB of a packet dropped due to the XSA-392 handling (CVE-2022-42328).

TFlite graphs must not have loops between nodes. However, this condition was not checked and an attacker could craft models that would result in infinite loop during evaluation. In certain cases, the infinite loop would be replaced by stack overflow due to too many recursive calls. For example, the `While` implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/106d8f4fb89335a2c52d7c895b7a7485465ca8d9/tensorflow/lite/kernels/while.cc) could be tricked into a scneario where both the body and the loop subgraphs are the same. Evaluating one of the subgraphs means calling the `Eval` function for the other and this quickly exhaust all stack space. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range. Please consult our security guide(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n- CVE-2021-3416: A potential stack overflow via infinite loop issue was found in various NIC emulators of QEMU in versions up to and including 5.2.0. The issue occurs in loopback mode of a NIC wherein reentrant DMA checks get bypassed. A guest user/process may use this flaw to consume CPU cycles or crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario.\n\n- CVE-2021-39194: kaml is an open source implementation of the YAML format with support for kotlinx.serialization. In affected versions attackers that could provide arbitrary YAML input to an application that uses kaml could cause the application to endlessly loop while parsing the input. This could result in resource starvation and denial of service. This only affects applications that use polymorphic serialization with the default tagged polymorphism style. Applications using the property polymorphism style are not affected. YAML input for a polymorphic type that provided a tag but no value for the object would trigger the issue. Version 0.35.3 or later contain the fix for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-1252: A vulnerability in the Excel XLM macro parsing module in Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.103.0 and 0.103.1 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper error handling that may result in an infinite loop. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Excel file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process hang, resulting in a denial of service condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-21235: kamadak-exif is an exif parsing library written in pure Rust. In kamadak-exif version 0.5.2, there is an infinite loop in parsing crafted PNG files. Specifically, reader::read_from_container can cause an infinite loop when a crafted PNG file is given. This is fixed in version 0.5.3. No workaround is available. Applications that do not pass files with the PNG signature to Reader::read_from_container are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2021-27385: A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC HMI Comfort Outdoor Panels V15 7\\\\\" & 15\\\\\" (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V15.1 Update 6), SIMATIC HMI Comfort Outdoor Panels V16 7\\\\\" & 15\\\\\" (incl.

A remote attacker could send specially crafted packets to SmartVNC device layout handler on client side, which could influence the amount of resources consumed and result in a Denial-of-Service (infinite loop) condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-27807: A carefully crafted PDF file can trigger an infinite loop while loading the file. This issue affects Apache PDFBox version 2.0.22 and prior 2.0.x versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-30468: A vulnerability in the JsonMapObjectReaderWriter of Apache CXF allows an attacker to submit malformed JSON to a web service, which results in the thread getting stuck in an infinite loop, consuming CPU indefinitely. This issue affects Apache CXF versions prior to 3.4.4; Apache CXF versions prior to 3.3.11.\n\n- CVE-2021-31812: In Apache PDFBox, a carefully crafted PDF file can trigger an infinite loop while loading the file. This issue affects Apache PDFBox version 2.0.23 and prior 2.0.x versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-35515: When reading a specially crafted 7Z archive, the construction of the list of codecs that decompress an entry can result in an infinite loop. This could be used to mount a denial of service attack against services that use Compress' sevenz package.\n\n- CVE-2021-38387: In Contiki 3.0, a Telnet server that silently quits (before disconnection with clients) leads to connected clients entering an infinite loop and waiting forever, which may cause excessive CPU consumption.\n\n- CVE-2021-43172: NLnet Labs Routinator prior to 0.10.2 happily processes a chain of RRDP repositories of infinite length causing it to never finish a validation run. In RPKI, a CA can choose the RRDP repository it wishes to publish its data in. By continuously generating a new child CA that only consists of another CA using a different RRDP repository, a malicious CA can create a chain of CAs of de-facto infinite length. Routinator prior to version 0.10.2 did not contain a limit on the length of such a chain and will therefore continue to process this chain forever. As a result, the validation run will never finish, leading to Routinator continuing to serve the old data set or, if in the initial validation run directly after starting, never serve any data at all.\n\n- CVE-2020-12655: An issue was discovered in xfs_agf_verify in fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_alloc.c in the Linux kernel through 5.6.10. Attackers may trigger a sync of excessive duration via an XFS v5 image with crafted metadata, aka CID-d0c7feaf8767.\n\n- CVE-2021-3679: A lack of CPU resource in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality in versions prior to 5.14-rc3 was found in the way user uses trace ring buffer in a specific way. Only privileged local users (with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) could use this flaw to starve the resources causing denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2021-3908: OctoRPKI does not limit the depth of a certificate chain, allowing for a CA to create children in an ad-hoc fashion, thereby making tree traversal never end.\n\n- CVE-2021-4182: Crash in the RFC 7468 dissector in Wireshark 3.6.0 and 3.4.0 to 3.4.10 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file\n\n- CVE-2021-3737: A flaw was found in python. An improperly handled HTTP response in the HTTP client code of python may allow a remote attacker, who controls the HTTP server, to make the client script enter an infinite loop, consuming CPU time. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-24191: In HTMLDOC 1.9.14, an infinite loop in the gif_read_lzw function can lead to a pointer arbitrarily pointing to heap memory and resulting in a buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2022-23437: There's a vulnerability within the Apache Xerces Java (XercesJ) XML parser when handling specially crafted XML document payloads. This causes, the XercesJ XML parser to wait in an infinite loop, which may sometimes consume system resources for prolonged duration. This vulnerability is present within XercesJ version 2.12.1 and the previous versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-23641: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. In versions prior to 2.8.1 in the `stable` branch, 2.9.0.beta2 in the `beta` branch, and 2.9.0.beta2 in the `tests-passed` branch, users can trigger a Denial of Service attack by posting a streaming URL. Parsing Oneboxes in the background job trigger an infinite loop, which cause memory leaks. This issue is patched in version 2.8.1 of the `stable` branch, 2.9.0.beta2 of the `beta` branch, and 2.9.0.beta2 of the `tests-passed` branch. As a workaround, disable onebox in admin panel completely or specify allow list of domains that will be oneboxed.\n\n- CVE-2022-31628: In PHP versions before 7.4.31, 8.0.24 and 8.1.11, the phar uncompressor code would recursively uncompress \"quines\" gzip files, resulting in an infinite loop.\n\n- CVE-2022-46770: qubes-mirage-firewall (aka Mirage firewall for QubesOS) 0.8.x through 0.8.3 allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and loss of forwarding) via a crafted multicast UDP packet (IP address range of 224.0.0.0 through 239.255.255.255).\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-834 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-834 (ChildOf)",

This is accomplished by extracting package contents into a project's `node_modules` folder. If the `node_modules` folder of the root project or any of its dependencies is somehow replaced with a symbolic link, it could allow Arborist to write package dependencies to any arbitrary location on the file system. Note that symbolic links contained within package artifact contents are filtered out, so another means of creating a `node_modules` symbolic link would have to be employed. 1. A `preinstall` script could replace `node_modules` with a symlink. (This is prevented by using `--ignore-scripts`.) 2. An attacker could supply the target with a git repository, instructing them to run `npm install --ignore-scripts` in the root. This may be successful, because `npm install --ignore-scripts` is typically not capable of making changes outside of the project directory, so it may be deemed safe. This is patched in @npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above. For more information including workarounds please see the referenced GHSA-gmw6-94gg-2rc2.\n\n- CVE-2021-1612: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software CLI could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the local system. This vulnerability is due to improper access controls on files within the local file system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a symbolic link in a specific location on the local file system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on an affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-26089: An improper symlink following in FortiClient for Mac 6.4.3 and below may allow an non-privileged user to execute arbitrary privileged shell commands during installation phase.\n\n- CVE-2022-20720: Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOx application hosting environment on multiple Cisco platforms could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying host operating system, execute arbitrary code on the underlying host operating system, install applications without being authenticated, or conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the affected software. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2022-26612: In Apache Hadoop, The unTar function uses unTarUsingJava function on Windows and the built-in tar utility on Unix and other OSes. As a result, a TAR entry may create a symlink under the expected extraction directory which points to an external directory. A subsequent TAR entry may extract an arbitrary file into the external directory using the symlink name. This however would be caught by the same targetDirPath check on Unix because of the getCanonicalPath call. However on Windows, getCanonicalPath doesn't resolve symbolic links, which bypasses the check. unpackEntries during TAR extraction follows symbolic links which allows writing outside expected base directory on Windows. This was addressed in Apache Hadoop 3.2.3\n\n- CVE-2022-3592: A symlink following vulnerability was found in Samba, where a user can create a symbolic link that will make 'smbd' escape the configured share path. This flaw allows a remote user with access to the exported part of the file system under a share via SMB1 unix extensions or NFS to create symlinks to files outside the 'smbd' configured share path and gain access to another restricted server's filesystem.\n\n- CVE-2022-36113: Cargo is a package manager for the rust programming language. After a package is downloaded, Cargo extracts its source code in the ~/.cargo folder on disk, making it available to the Rust projects it builds. To record when an extraction is successful, Cargo writes \"ok\" to the .cargo-ok file at the root of the extracted source code once it extracted all the files. It was discovered that Cargo allowed packages to contain a .cargo-ok symbolic link, which Cargo would extract. Then, when Cargo attempted to write \"ok\" into .cargo-ok, it would actually replace the first two bytes of the file the symlink pointed to with ok. This would allow an attacker to corrupt one file on the machine using Cargo to extract the package. Note that by design Cargo allows code execution at build time, due to build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerabilities in this advisory allow performing a subset of the possible damage in a harder to track down way. Your dependencies must still be trusted if you want to be protected from attacks, as it's possible to perform the same attacks with build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerability is present in all versions of Cargo. Rust 1.64, to be released on September 22nd, will include a fix for it. Since the vulnerability is just a more limited way to accomplish what a malicious build scripts or procedural macros can do, we decided not to publish Rust point releases backporting the security fix. Patch files are available for Rust 1.63.0 are available in the wg-security-response repository for people building their own toolchain. Mitigations We recommend users of alternate registries to exercise care in which package they download, by only including trusted dependencies in their projects. Please note that even with these vulnerabilities fixed, by design Cargo allows arbitrary code execution at build time thanks to build scripts and procedural macros: a malicious dependency will be able to cause damage regardless of these vulnerabilities. crates.io implemented server-side checks to reject these kinds of packages years ago, and there are no packages on crates.io exploiting these vulnerabilities. crates.io users still need to exercise care in choosing their dependencies though, as remote code execution is allowed by design there as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24904: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with version 0.7.0 and prior to versions 2.1.15m 2.2.9, and 2.3.4 is vulnerable to a symlink following bug allowing a malicious user with repository write access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user with write access for a repository which is (or may be) used in a directory-type Application may commit a symlink which points to an out-of-bounds file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include manifest files from other Applications' source repositories (potentially decrypted files, if you are using a decryption plugin) or any JSON-formatted secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.4, 2.2.9, and 2.1.15.

Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.\n\n\nA race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:\n\n\n  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.\n\n  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.\n\nA race condition exists when an \"interfering code sequence\" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.\n\nThe interfering code sequence could be \"trusted\" or \"untrusted.\" A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-29527: Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2021-0920: Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-6819: Chain: race condition (CWE-362) leads to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2019-18827: chain: JTAG interface is not disabled (CWE-1191) during ROM code execution, introducing a race condition (CWE-362) to extract encryption keys\n\n- CVE-2019-1161: Chain: race condition (CWE-362) in anti-malware product allows deletion of files by creating a junction (CWE-1386) and using hard links during the time window in which a temporary file is created and deleted.\n\n- CVE-2015-1743: TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed\n\n- CVE-2014-8273: Chain: chipset has a race condition (CWE-362) between when an interrupt handler detects an attempt to write-enable the BIOS (in violation of the lock bit), and when the handler resets the write-enable bit back to 0, allowing attackers to issue BIOS writes during the timing window [REF-1237].\n\n- CVE-2008-5044: Race condition leading to a crash by calling a hook removal procedure while other activities are occurring at the same time.\n\n- CVE-2008-2958: chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.\n\n- CVE-2008-1570: chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.\n\n- CVE-2008-0058: Unsynchronized caching operation enables a race condition that causes messages to be sent to a deallocated object.\n\n- CVE-2008-0379: Race condition during initialization triggers a buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2007-6599: Daemon crash by quickly performing operations and undoing them, which eventually leads to an operation that does not acquire a lock.\n\n- CVE-2007-6180: chain: race condition triggers NULL pointer dereference\n\n- CVE-2007-5794: Race condition in library function could cause data to be sent to the wrong process.\n\n- CVE-2007-3970: Race condition in file parser leads to heap corruption.\n\n- CVE-2008-5021: chain: race condition allows attacker to access an object while it is still being initialized, causing software to access uninitialized memory.\n\n- CVE-2009-4895: chain: race condition for an argument value, possibly resulting in NULL dereference\n\n- CVE-2009-3547: chain: race condition might allow resource to be released before operating on it, leading to NULL dereference\n\n- CVE-2006-5051: Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-6388: Out of bounds access in WebAudio in Google Chrome prior to 80.0.3987.87 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-0366: In vpu, there is a possible memory corruption due to a race condition.

The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, get de-allocated when a guest switched (back) from v2 to v1. The freeing of such pages requires that the hypervisor know where in the guest these pages were mapped. The hypervisor tracks only one use within guest space, but racing requests from the guest to insert mappings of these pages may result in any of them to become mapped in multiple locations. Upon switching back from v2 to v1, the guest would then retain access to a page that was freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes.\n\n- CVE-2021-28701: Another race in XENMAPSPACE_grant_table handling Guests are permitted access to certain Xen-owned pages of memory. The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, are de-allocated when a guest switches (back) from v2 to v1. Freeing such pages requires that the hypervisor enforce that no parallel request can result in the addition of a mapping of such a page to a guest. That enforcement was missing, allowing guests to retain access to pages that were freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes. Unfortunately, when XSA-379 was being prepared, this similar issue was not noticed.\n\n- CVE-2020-11492: An issue was discovered in Docker Desktop through 2.2.0.5 on Windows.

If this is not the case, they assume that a following removal of the granted access will always succeed, which is not true in case the backend has mapped the granted page between those two operations. As a result the backend can keep access to the memory page of the guest no matter how the page will be used after the frontend I/O has finished. The xenbus driver has a similar problem, as it doesn't check the success of removing the granted access of a shared ring buffer. blkfront: CVE-2022-23036 netfront: CVE-2022-23037 scsifront: CVE-2022-23038 gntalloc: CVE-2022-23039 xenbus: CVE-2022-23040 blkfront, netfront, scsifront, usbfront, dmabuf, xenbus, 9p, kbdfront, and pvcalls are using a functionality to delay freeing a grant reference until it is no longer in use, but the freeing of the related data page is not synchronized with dropping the granted access. As a result the backend can keep access to the memory page even after it has been freed and then re-used for a different purpose.

When a BGP flow route with redirect IP extended community is received, and the reachability to the next-hop of the corresponding redirect IP is flapping, the rpd process might crash. Whether the crash occurs depends on the timing of the internally processing of these two events and is outside the attackers control. Please note that this issue also affects Route-Reflectors unless 'routing-options flow firewall-install-disable' is configured.

In affected versions the implementation for `tf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesCreateEnsemble` can result in a use after free error if an attacker supplies specially crafted arguments. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f24faa153ad31a4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/boosted_trees/resource_ops.cc#L55) uses a reference counted resource and decrements the refcount if the initialization fails, as it should. However, when the code was written, the resource was represented as a naked pointer but later refactoring has changed it to be a smart pointer. Thus, when the pointer leaves the scope, a subsequent `free`-ing of the resource occurs, but this fails to take into account that the refcount has already reached 0, thus the resource has been already freed. During this double-free process, members of the resource object are accessed for cleanup but they are invalid as the entire resource has been freed. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 5ecec9c6fbdbc6be03295685190a45e7eee726ab. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0.

The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNorm` is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. If the tensors are empty, the same implementation can trigger undefined behavior by dereferencing null pointers. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/57d86e0db5d1365f19adcce848dfc1bf89fdd4c7/tensorflow/core/kernels/fused_batch_norm_op.cc) fails to validate that `scale`, `offset`, `mean` and `variance` (the last two only when required) all have the same number of elements as the number of channels of `x`. This results in heap out of bounds reads when the buffers backing these tensors are indexed past their boundary. If the tensors are empty, the validation mentioned in the above paragraph would also trigger and prevent the undefined behavior. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29988: Firefox incorrectly treated an inline list-item element as a block element, resulting in an out of bounds read or memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

The function ezxml_parse_str() performs incorrect memory handling while parsing crafted XML files (out-of-bounds read after a certain strcspn failure).\n\n- CVE-2021-32761: Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. A vulnerability involving out-of-bounds read and integer overflow to buffer overflow exists starting with version 2.2 and prior to versions 5.0.13, 6.0.15, and 6.2.5. On 32-bit systems, Redis `*BIT*` command are vulnerable to integer overflow that can potentially be exploited to corrupt the heap, leak arbitrary heap contents or trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter to a very large value and constructing specially crafted commands bit commands. This problem only affects Redis on 32-bit platforms, or compiled as a 32-bit binary. Redis versions 5.0.`3m 6.0.15, and 6.2.5 contain patches for this issue. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the `redis-server` executable is to prevent users from modifying the `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.\n\n- CVE-2021-3409: The patch for CVE-2020-17380/CVE-2020-25085 was found to be ineffective, thus making QEMU vulnerable to the out-of-bounds read/write access issues previously found in the SDHCI controller emulation code. This flaw allows a malicious privileged guest to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service or potential code execution. QEMU up to (including) 5.2.0 is affected by this.\n\n- CVE-2021-3517: There is a flaw in the xml entity encoding functionality of libxml2 in versions before 2.9.11. An attacker who is able to supply a crafted file to be processed by an application linked with the affected functionality of libxml2 could trigger an out-of-bounds read. The most likely impact of this flaw is to application availability, with some potential impact to confidentiality and integrity if an attacker is able to use memory information to further exploit the application.\n\n- CVE-2021-3712: ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2y).\n\n- CVE-2021-31174: Microsoft Excel Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-27408: The affected product is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read, which can cause information leakage leading to arbitrary code execution if chained to the out-of-bounds write vulnerability on the Welch Allyn medical device management tools (Welch Allyn Service Tool: versions prior to v1.10, Welch Allyn Connex Device Integration Suite \u2013 Network Connectivity Engine (NCE): versions prior to v5.3, Welch Allyn Software Development Kit (SDK): versions prior to v3.2, Welch Allyn Connex Central Station (CS): versions prior to v1.8.6, Welch Allyn Service Monitor: versions prior to v1.7.0.0, Welch Allyn Connex Vital Signs Monitor (CVSM): versions prior to v2.43.02, Welch Allyn Connex Integrated Wall System (CIWS): versions prior to v2.43.02, Welch Allyn Connex Spot Monitor (CSM): versions prior to v1.52, Welch Allyn Spot Vital Signs 4400 Device (Spot 4400) / Welch Allyn Spot 4400 Vital Signs Extended Care Device: versions prior to v1.11.00).\n\n- CVE-2021-27791: The function that is used to parse the Authentication header in Brocade Fabric OS Web application service before Brocade Fabric OS v9.0.1a and v8.2.3a fails to properly process a malformed authentication header from the client, resulting in reading memory addresses outside the intended range.

If that file endsin a line with 4095 consecutive non-white space letters and no newline, curlwould first read past the end of the stack-based buffer, and if the readworks, write a zero byte beyond its boundary.This will in most cases cause a segfault or similar, but circumstances might also cause different outcomes.If a malicious user can provide a custom netrc file to an application or otherwise affect its contents, this flaw could be used as denial-of-service.\n\n- CVE-2022-39392: Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to version 2.0.2, there is a bug in Wasmtime's implementation of its pooling instance allocator when the allocator is configured to give WebAssembly instances a maximum of zero pages of memory. In this configuration, the virtual memory mapping for WebAssembly memories did not meet the compiler-required configuration requirements for safely executing WebAssembly modules. Wasmtime's default settings require virtual memory page faults to indicate that wasm reads/writes are out-of-bounds, but the pooling allocator's configuration would not create an appropriate virtual memory mapping for this meaning out of bounds reads/writes can successfully read/write memory unrelated to the wasm sandbox within range of the base address of the memory mapping created by the pooling allocator. This bug is not applicable with the default settings of the `wasmtime` crate. This bug can only be triggered by setting `InstanceLimits::memory_pages` to zero. This is expected to be a very rare configuration since this means that wasm modules cannot allocate any pages of linear memory. All wasm modules produced by all current toolchains are highly likely to use linear memory, so it's expected to be unlikely that this configuration is set to zero by any production embedding of Wasmtime. This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2. This bug can be worked around by increasing the `memory_pages` allotment when configuring the pooling allocator to a value greater than zero. If an embedding wishes to still prevent memory from actually being used then the `Store::limiter` method can be used to dynamically disallow growth of memory beyond 0 bytes large. Note that the default `memory_pages` value is greater than zero.\n\n- CVE-2022-41902: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The function MakeGrapplerFunctionItem takes arguments that determine the sizes of inputs and outputs. If the inputs given are greater than or equal to the sizes of the outputs, an out-of-bounds memory read or a crash is triggered. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit a65411a1d69edfb16b25907ffb8f73556ce36bb7. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.8.4, 2.9.3, and 2.10.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-41981: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the TGA file format parser of OpenImageIO v2.3.19.0. A specially-crafted targa file can lead to out of bounds read and write on the process stack, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-4203: A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. In theory it could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext) although we are not aware of any working exploit leading to memory contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects. \n\n- CVE-2022-48303: GNU Tar through 1.34 has a one-byte out-of-bounds read that results in use of uninitialized memory for a conditional jump. Exploitation to change the flow of control has not been demonstrated.

The greatest risk from this flaw is to application availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-1441: MP4Box is a component of GPAC-2.0.0, which is a widely-used third-party package on RPM Fusion. When MP4Box tries to parse a MP4 file, it calls the function `diST_box_read()` to read from video. In this function, it allocates a buffer `str` with fixed length. However, content read from `bs` is controllable by user, so is the length, which causes a buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2022-3435: A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in Linux Kernel.

In affected versions the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad` is vulnerable to an integer overflow issue caused by converting a signed integer value to an unsigned one and then allocating memory based on this value. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.cc#L126) uses the `axis` value as the size argument to `absl::InlinedVector` constructor. But, the constructor uses an unsigned type for the argument, so the implicit conversion transforms the negative value to a large integer. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 96f364a1ca3009f98980021c4b32be5fdcca33a1. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, and TensorFlow 2.4.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-37646: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams` is vulnerable to an integer overflow issue caused by converting a signed integer value to an unsigned one and then allocating memory based on this value.

The `reserve` method calls `TF_TString_Reserve` which has an `unsigned long` argument for the size of the buffer. Hence, the implicit conversion transforms the negative value to a large integer. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit c283e542a3f422420cfdb332414543b62fc4e4a5. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0.

In versions prior to 1.3.0 there exists a DoS vulnerability that is possible due to a bug in the library that would allow an attacker with specifically designed queries to cause stack overflow panics. Any user with access to the GraphQL handler can send these queries and cause stack overflows. This in turn could potentially compromise the ability of the server to serve data to its users. The issue has been patched in version `v1.3.0`. The only known workaround for this issue is to disable the `graphql.MaxDepth` option from your schema which is not recommended.\n\n- CVE-2022-23591: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The `GraphDef` format in TensorFlow does not allow self recursive functions. The runtime assumes that this invariant is satisfied. However, a `GraphDef` containing a fragment such as the following can be consumed when loading a `SavedModel`. This would result in a stack overflow during execution as resolving each `NodeDef` means resolving the function itself and its nodes. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-24675: encoding/pem in Go before 1.17.9 and 1.18.x before 1.18.1 has a Decode stack overflow via a large amount of PEM data.\n\n- CVE-2022-31019: Vapor is a server-side Swift HTTP web framework. When using automatic content decoding an attacker can craft a request body that can make the server crash with the following request: `curl -d \"array[_0][0][array][_0][0][array]$(for f in $(seq 1100); do echo -n '[_0][0][array]'; done)[string][_0]=hello%20world\" http://localhost:8080/foo`. The issue is unbounded, attacker controlled stack growth which will at some point lead to a stack overflow and a process crash. This issue has been fixed in version 4.61.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-31099: rulex is a new, portable, regular expression language. When parsing untrusted rulex expressions, the stack may overflow, possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when parsing an expression with several hundred levels of nesting, causing the process to abort immediately. This is a security concern for you, if your service parses untrusted rulex expressions (expressions provided by an untrusted user), and your service becomes unavailable when the process running rulex aborts due to a stack overflow. The crash is fixed in version **0.4.3**. Affected users are advised to update to this version. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-3216: A vulnerability has been found in Nintendo Game Boy Color and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the component Mobile Adapter GB. The manipulation leads to memory corruption. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. VDB-208606 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-38334: XPDF v4.04 and earlier was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the function Catalog::countPageTree() at Catalog.cc.\n\n- CVE-2022-41966: XStream serializes Java objects to XML and back again. Versions prior to 1.4.20 may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error, resulting in a denial of service only via manipulation the processed input stream. The attack uses the hash code implementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash calculation causing a stack overflow. This issue is patched in version 1.4.20 which handles the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead. A potential workaround for users who only use HashMap or HashSet and whose XML refers these only as default map or set, is to change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util per the code example in the referenced advisory. However, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.\n\n- CVE-2022-47662: GPAC MP4Box 2.1-DEV-rev649-ga8f438d20 has a segment fault (/stack overflow) due to infinite recursion in Media_GetSample isomedia/media.c:662\n\n- CVE-2022-23460: Jsonxx or Json++ is a JSON parser, writer and reader written in C++. In affected versions of jsonxx json parsing may lead to stack exhaustion in an address sanitized (ASAN) build. This issue may lead to Denial of Service if the program using the jsonxx library crashes. This issue exists on the current commit of the jsonxx project and the project itself has been archived. Updates are not expected. Users are advised to find a replacement.\n\n- CVE-2022-23606: Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications. When a cluster is deleted via Cluster Discovery Service (CDS) all idle connections established to endpoints in that cluster are disconnected. A recursion was introduced in the procedure of disconnecting idle connections that can lead to stack exhaustion and abnormal process termination when a cluster has a large number of idle connections. This infinite recursion causes Envoy to crash. Users are advised to upgrade.\n\n- CVE-2022-24921: regexp.Compile in Go before 1.16.15 and 1.17.x before 1.17.8 allows stack exhaustion via a deeply nested expression.\n\n- CVE-2022-25313: In Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5, an attacker can trigger stack exhaustion in build_model via a large nesting depth in the DTD element.\n\n- CVE-2022-27810: It was possible to trigger an infinite recursion condition in the error handler when Hermes executed specific maliciously formed JavaScript.

All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2009-0935: Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice\n\n- CVE-2010-4210: function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.\n\n- CVE-2008-4302: Chain: OS kernel does not properly handle a failure of a function call (CWE-755), leading to an unlock of a resource that was not locked (CWE-832), with resultant crash.\n\n- CVE-2009-1243: OS kernel performs an unlock in some incorrect circumstances, leading to panic.\n\n- CVE-2009-2857: OS deadlock\n\n- CVE-2009-1961: OS deadlock involving 3 separate functions\n\n- CVE-2009-2699: deadlock in library\n\n- CVE-2009-4272: deadlock triggered by packets that force collisions in a routing table\n\n- CVE-2002-1850: read/write deadlock between web server and script\n\n- CVE-2004-0174: web server deadlock involving multiple listening connections\n\n- CVE-2009-1388: multiple simultaneous calls to the same function trigger deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2006-5158: chain: other weakness leads to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) or deadlock (CWE-833).\n\n- CVE-2006-4342: deadlock when an operation is performed on a resource while it is being removed.\n\n- CVE-2006-2374: Deadlock in device driver triggered by using file handle of a related device.\n\n- CVE-2006-2275: Deadlock when large number of small messages cannot be processed quickly enough.\n\n- CVE-2005-3847: OS kernel has deadlock triggered by a signal during a core dump.\n\n- CVE-2005-3106: Race condition leads to deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2005-2456: Chain: array index error (CWE-129) leads to deadlock (CWE-833)\n\n- CVE-2001-0682: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a mutex.\n\n- CVE-2002-1914: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.\n\n- CVE-2002-1915: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.\n\n- CVE-2002-0051: Critical file can be opened with exclusive read access by user, preventing application of security policy.

This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android SoCAndroid ID: A-185195268\n\n- CVE-2021-0625: In ccu, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS05594996; Issue ID: ALPS05594996.\n\n- CVE-2020-27014: Trend Micro Antivirus for Mac 2020 (Consumer) contains a race condition vulnerability in the Web Threat Protection Blocklist component, that if exploited, could allow an attacker to case a kernel panic or crash.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAn attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: A race condition was addressed with improved locking. This issue is fixed in macOS Big Sur 11.2, Security Update 2021-001 Catalina, Security Update 2021-001 Mojave, watchOS 7.3, tvOS 14.4, iOS 14.4 and iPadOS 14.4. A malicious application may be able to elevate privileges. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited..\n\n- CVE-2021-31961: Windows InstallService Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26708: A local privilege escalation was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.10.13. Multiple race conditions in the AF_VSOCK implementation are caused by wrong locking in net/vmw_vsock/af_vsock.c. The race conditions were implicitly introduced in the commits that added VSOCK multi-transport support.\n\n- CVE-2021-0330: In add_user_ce and remove_user_ce of storaged.cpp, there is a possible use-after-free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in storaged with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-9 Android-10 Android-11Android ID: A-170732441\n\n- CVE-2021-0940: In TBD of TBD, there is a possible out of bounds write due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in the kernel with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-171315276References: N/A\n\n- CVE-2021-26312: Failure to flush the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) of the I/O memory management unit (IOMMU) may lead an IO device to write to memory it should not be able to access, resulting in a potential loss of integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-29509: Puma is a concurrent HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications. The fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris). The fix is very small and a git patch is available for those using unsupported versions of Puma.\n\n- CVE-2021-4001: A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's ebpf verifier between bpf_map_update_elem and bpf_map_freeze due to a missing lock in kernel/bpf/syscall.c. In this flaw, a local user with a special privilege (cap_sys_admin or cap_bpf) can modify the frozen mapped address space. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.16 rc2.\n\n- CVE-2021-41141: PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in the C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In various parts of PJSIP, when error/failure occurs, it is found that the function returns without releasing the currently held locks. This could result in a system deadlock, which cause a denial of service for the users. No release has yet been made which contains the linked fix commit. All versions up to an including 2.11.1 are affected. Users may need to manually apply the patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-4149: A vulnerability was found in btrfs_alloc_tree_b in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c in the Linux kernel due to an improper lock operation in btrfs. In this flaw, a user with a local privilege may cause a denial of service (DOS) due to a deadlock problem.\n\n- CVE-2022-20016: In vow driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking.

This could lead to local denial of service in kernel.\n\n- CVE-2022-42775: In camera driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local denial of service in kernel.\n\n- CVE-2022-26356: Racy interactions between dirty vram tracking and paging log dirty hypercalls Activation of log dirty mode done by XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram (was named HVMOP_track_dirty_vram before Xen 4.9) is racy with ongoing log dirty hypercalls. A suitably timed call to XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram can enable log dirty while another CPU is still in the process of tearing down the structures related to a previously enabled log dirty mode (XEN_DOMCTL_SHADOW_OP_OFF). This is due to lack of mutually exclusive locking between both operations and can lead to entries being added in already freed slots, resulting in a memory leak.\n\n- CVE-2021-0147: Improper locking in the Power Management Controller (PMC) for some Intel Chipset firmware before versions pmc_fw_lbg_c1-21ww02a and pmc_fw_lbg_b0-21ww02a may allow a privileged user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-39640: In __dwc3_gadget_ep0_queue of ep0.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to improper locking.

This vulnerability is due to a deadlock condition in the code when processing COPS packets under certain conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending COPS packets with high burst rates to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the CPU to consume excessive resources, which prevents other control plane processes from obtaining resources and results in a DoS.\n\n- CVE-2021-20291: A deadlock vulnerability was found in 'github.com/containers/storage' in versions before 1.28.1. When a container image is processed, each layer is unpacked using `tar`. If one of those layers is not a valid `tar` archive this causes an error leading to an unexpected situation where the code indefinitely waits for the tar unpacked stream, which never finishes. An attacker could use this vulnerability to craft a malicious image, which when downloaded and stored by an application using containers/storage, would then cause a deadlock leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n- CVE-2021-28951: An issue was discovered in fs/io_uring.c in the Linux kernel through 5.11.8. It allows attackers to cause a denial of service (deadlock) because exit may be waiting to park a SQPOLL thread, but concurrently that SQPOLL thread is waiting for a signal to start, aka CID-3ebba796fa25.\n\n- CVE-2021-31611: The Bluetooth Classic implementation on Zhuhai Jieli AC690X and AC692X devices does not properly handle an out-of-order LMP Setup procedure that is followed by a malformed LMP packet, allowing attackers in radio range to deadlock a device via a crafted LMP packet. The user needs to manually reboot the device to restore communication.\n\n- CVE-2021-31785: The Bluetooth Classic implementation on Actions ATS2815 and ATS2819 chipsets does not properly handle the reception of multiple LMP_host_connection_req packets, allowing attackers in radio range to trigger a denial of service (deadlock) of the device via crafted LMP packets. Manual user intervention is required to restart the device and restore Bluetooth communication.\n\n- CVE-2021-38203: btrfs in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (deadlock) via processes that trigger allocation of new system chunks during times when there is a shortage of free space in the system space_info.\n\n- CVE-2021-31786: The Bluetooth Classic Audio implementation on Actions ATS2815 and ATS2819 devices does not properly handle a connection attempt from a host with the same BDAddress as the current connected BT host, allowing attackers to trigger a disconnection and deadlock of the device by connecting with a forged BDAddress that matches the original connected host.\n\n- CVE-2021-3499: A vulnerability was found in OVN Kubernetes in versions up to and including 0.3.0 where the Egress Firewall does not reliably apply firewall rules when there is multiple DNS rules. It could lead to potentially lose of confidentiality, integrity or availability of a service.\n\n- CVE-2021-3735: A deadlock issue was found in the AHCI controller device of QEMU. It occurs on a software reset (ahci_reset_port) while handling a host-to-device Register FIS (Frame Information Structure) packet from the guest. A privileged user inside the guest could use this flaw to hang the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-43395: An issue was discovered in illumos before f859e7171bb5db34321e45585839c6c3200ebb90, OmniOS Community Edition r151038, OpenIndiana Hipster 2021.04, and SmartOS 20210923. A local unprivileged user can cause a deadlock and kernel panic via crafted rename and rmdir calls on tmpfs filesystems. Oracle Solaris 10 and 11 is also affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-31621: MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. In extra/mariabackup/ds_xbstream.cc, when an error occurs (stream_ctxt->dest_file == NULL) while executing the method xbstream_open, the held lock is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock. Note: The vendor argues this is just an improper locking bug and not a vulnerability with adverse effects.\n\n- CVE-2022-31622: MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. In extra/mariabackup/ds_compress.cc, when an error occurs (pthread_create returns a nonzero value) while executing the method create_worker_threads, the held lock is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock. Note: The vendor argues this is just an improper locking bug and not a vulnerability with adverse effects.\n\n- CVE-2022-31623: MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. In extra/mariabackup/ds_compress.cc, when an error occurs (i.e., going to the err label) while executing the method create_worker_threads, the held lock thd->ctrl_mutex is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock. Note: The vendor argues this is just an improper locking bug and not a vulnerability with adverse effects.\n\n- CVE-2022-31624: MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. While executing the plugin/server_audit/server_audit.c method log_statement_ex, the held lock lock_bigbuffer is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2022-38791: In MariaDB before 10.9.2, compress_write in extra/mariabackup/ds_compress.cc does not release data_mutex upon a stream write failure, which allows local users to trigger a deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2022-42328: Guests can trigger deadlock in Linux netback driver T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] The patch for XSA-392 introduced another issue which might result in a deadlock when trying to free the SKB of a packet dropped due to the XSA-392 handling (CVE-2022-42328).

Evaluating one of the subgraphs means calling the `Eval` function for the other and this quickly exhaust all stack space. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range. Please consult our security guide(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n- CVE-2021-3416: A potential stack overflow via infinite loop issue was found in various NIC emulators of QEMU in versions up to and including 5.2.0. The issue occurs in loopback mode of a NIC wherein reentrant DMA checks get bypassed. A guest user/process may use this flaw to consume CPU cycles or crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario.\n\n- CVE-2021-39194: kaml is an open source implementation of the YAML format with support for kotlinx.serialization. In affected versions attackers that could provide arbitrary YAML input to an application that uses kaml could cause the application to endlessly loop while parsing the input. This could result in resource starvation and denial of service. This only affects applications that use polymorphic serialization with the default tagged polymorphism style. Applications using the property polymorphism style are not affected. YAML input for a polymorphic type that provided a tag but no value for the object would trigger the issue. Version 0.35.3 or later contain the fix for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-1252: A vulnerability in the Excel XLM macro parsing module in Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.103.0 and 0.103.1 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper error handling that may result in an infinite loop. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Excel file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process hang, resulting in a denial of service condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-21235: kamadak-exif is an exif parsing library written in pure Rust. In kamadak-exif version 0.5.2, there is an infinite loop in parsing crafted PNG files. Specifically, reader::read_from_container can cause an infinite loop when a crafted PNG file is given. This is fixed in version 0.5.3. No workaround is available. Applications that do not pass files with the PNG signature to Reader::read_from_container are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2021-27385: A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC HMI Comfort Outdoor Panels V15 7\\\\\" & 15\\\\\" (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V15.1 Update 6), SIMATIC HMI Comfort Outdoor Panels V16 7\\\\\" & 15\\\\\" (incl.

A remote attacker could send specially crafted packets to SmartVNC device layout handler on client side, which could influence the amount of resources consumed and result in a Denial-of-Service (infinite loop) condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-27807: A carefully crafted PDF file can trigger an infinite loop while loading the file. This issue affects Apache PDFBox version 2.0.22 and prior 2.0.x versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-30468: A vulnerability in the JsonMapObjectReaderWriter of Apache CXF allows an attacker to submit malformed JSON to a web service, which results in the thread getting stuck in an infinite loop, consuming CPU indefinitely. This issue affects Apache CXF versions prior to 3.4.4; Apache CXF versions prior to 3.3.11.\n\n- CVE-2021-31812: In Apache PDFBox, a carefully crafted PDF file can trigger an infinite loop while loading the file. This issue affects Apache PDFBox version 2.0.23 and prior 2.0.x versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-35515: When reading a specially crafted 7Z archive, the construction of the list of codecs that decompress an entry can result in an infinite loop. This could be used to mount a denial of service attack against services that use Compress' sevenz package.\n\n- CVE-2021-38387: In Contiki 3.0, a Telnet server that silently quits (before disconnection with clients) leads to connected clients entering an infinite loop and waiting forever, which may cause excessive CPU consumption.\n\n- CVE-2021-43172: NLnet Labs Routinator prior to 0.10.2 happily processes a chain of RRDP repositories of infinite length causing it to never finish a validation run. In RPKI, a CA can choose the RRDP repository it wishes to publish its data in. By continuously generating a new child CA that only consists of another CA using a different RRDP repository, a malicious CA can create a chain of CAs of de-facto infinite length. Routinator prior to version 0.10.2 did not contain a limit on the length of such a chain and will therefore continue to process this chain forever. As a result, the validation run will never finish, leading to Routinator continuing to serve the old data set or, if in the initial validation run directly after starting, never serve any data at all.\n\n- CVE-2020-12655: An issue was discovered in xfs_agf_verify in fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_alloc.c in the Linux kernel through 5.6.10. Attackers may trigger a sync of excessive duration via an XFS v5 image with crafted metadata, aka CID-d0c7feaf8767.\n\n- CVE-2021-3679: A lack of CPU resource in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality in versions prior to 5.14-rc3 was found in the way user uses trace ring buffer in a specific way. Only privileged local users (with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) could use this flaw to starve the resources causing denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2021-3908: OctoRPKI does not limit the depth of a certificate chain, allowing for a CA to create children in an ad-hoc fashion, thereby making tree traversal never end.\n\n- CVE-2021-4182: Crash in the RFC 7468 dissector in Wireshark 3.6.0 and 3.4.0 to 3.4.10 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file\n\n- CVE-2021-3737: A flaw was found in python. An improperly handled HTTP response in the HTTP client code of python may allow a remote attacker, who controls the HTTP server, to make the client script enter an infinite loop, consuming CPU time. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-24191: In HTMLDOC 1.9.14, an infinite loop in the gif_read_lzw function can lead to a pointer arbitrarily pointing to heap memory and resulting in a buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2022-23437: There's a vulnerability within the Apache Xerces Java (XercesJ) XML parser when handling specially crafted XML document payloads. This causes, the XercesJ XML parser to wait in an infinite loop, which may sometimes consume system resources for prolonged duration. This vulnerability is present within XercesJ version 2.12.1 and the previous versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-23641: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. In versions prior to 2.8.1 in the `stable` branch, 2.9.0.beta2 in the `beta` branch, and 2.9.0.beta2 in the `tests-passed` branch, users can trigger a Denial of Service attack by posting a streaming URL. Parsing Oneboxes in the background job trigger an infinite loop, which cause memory leaks. This issue is patched in version 2.8.1 of the `stable` branch, 2.9.0.beta2 of the `beta` branch, and 2.9.0.beta2 of the `tests-passed` branch. As a workaround, disable onebox in admin panel completely or specify allow list of domains that will be oneboxed.\n\n- CVE-2022-31628: In PHP versions before 7.4.31, 8.0.24 and 8.1.11, the phar uncompressor code would recursively uncompress \"quines\" gzip files, resulting in an infinite loop.\n\n- CVE-2022-46770: qubes-mirage-firewall (aka Mirage firewall for QubesOS) 0.8.x through 0.8.3 allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and loss of forwarding) via a crafted multicast UDP packet (IP address range of 224.0.0.0 through 239.255.255.255).\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-834 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-834 (ChildOf)",

This is accomplished by extracting package contents into a project's `node_modules` folder. If the `node_modules` folder of the root project or any of its dependencies is somehow replaced with a symbolic link, it could allow Arborist to write package dependencies to any arbitrary location on the file system. Note that symbolic links contained within package artifact contents are filtered out, so another means of creating a `node_modules` symbolic link would have to be employed. 1. A `preinstall` script could replace `node_modules` with a symlink. (This is prevented by using `--ignore-scripts`.) 2. An attacker could supply the target with a git repository, instructing them to run `npm install --ignore-scripts` in the root. This may be successful, because `npm install --ignore-scripts` is typically not capable of making changes outside of the project directory, so it may be deemed safe. This is patched in @npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above. For more information including workarounds please see the referenced GHSA-gmw6-94gg-2rc2.\n\n- CVE-2021-1612: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software CLI could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the local system. This vulnerability is due to improper access controls on files within the local file system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a symbolic link in a specific location on the local file system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on an affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-26089: An improper symlink following in FortiClient for Mac 6.4.3 and below may allow an non-privileged user to execute arbitrary privileged shell commands during installation phase.\n\n- CVE-2022-20720: Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOx application hosting environment on multiple Cisco platforms could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying host operating system, execute arbitrary code on the underlying host operating system, install applications without being authenticated, or conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the affected software. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2022-26612: In Apache Hadoop, The unTar function uses unTarUsingJava function on Windows and the built-in tar utility on Unix and other OSes. As a result, a TAR entry may create a symlink under the expected extraction directory which points to an external directory. A subsequent TAR entry may extract an arbitrary file into the external directory using the symlink name. This however would be caught by the same targetDirPath check on Unix because of the getCanonicalPath call. However on Windows, getCanonicalPath doesn't resolve symbolic links, which bypasses the check. unpackEntries during TAR extraction follows symbolic links which allows writing outside expected base directory on Windows. This was addressed in Apache Hadoop 3.2.3\n\n- CVE-2022-3592: A symlink following vulnerability was found in Samba, where a user can create a symbolic link that will make 'smbd' escape the configured share path. This flaw allows a remote user with access to the exported part of the file system under a share via SMB1 unix extensions or NFS to create symlinks to files outside the 'smbd' configured share path and gain access to another restricted server's filesystem.\n\n- CVE-2022-36113: Cargo is a package manager for the rust programming language. After a package is downloaded, Cargo extracts its source code in the ~/.cargo folder on disk, making it available to the Rust projects it builds. To record when an extraction is successful, Cargo writes \"ok\" to the .cargo-ok file at the root of the extracted source code once it extracted all the files. It was discovered that Cargo allowed packages to contain a .cargo-ok symbolic link, which Cargo would extract. Then, when Cargo attempted to write \"ok\" into .cargo-ok, it would actually replace the first two bytes of the file the symlink pointed to with ok. This would allow an attacker to corrupt one file on the machine using Cargo to extract the package. Note that by design Cargo allows code execution at build time, due to build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerabilities in this advisory allow performing a subset of the possible damage in a harder to track down way. Your dependencies must still be trusted if you want to be protected from attacks, as it's possible to perform the same attacks with build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerability is present in all versions of Cargo. Rust 1.64, to be released on September 22nd, will include a fix for it. Since the vulnerability is just a more limited way to accomplish what a malicious build scripts or procedural macros can do, we decided not to publish Rust point releases backporting the security fix. Patch files are available for Rust 1.63.0 are available in the wg-security-response repository for people building their own toolchain. Mitigations We recommend users of alternate registries to exercise care in which package they download, by only including trusted dependencies in their projects. Please note that even with these vulnerabilities fixed, by design Cargo allows arbitrary code execution at build time thanks to build scripts and procedural macros: a malicious dependency will be able to cause damage regardless of these vulnerabilities. crates.io implemented server-side checks to reject these kinds of packages years ago, and there are no packages on crates.io exploiting these vulnerabilities. crates.io users still need to exercise care in choosing their dependencies though, as remote code execution is allowed by design there as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24904: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with version 0.7.0 and prior to versions 2.1.15m 2.2.9, and 2.3.4 is vulnerable to a symlink following bug allowing a malicious user with repository write access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user with write access for a repository which is (or may be) used in a directory-type Application may commit a symlink which points to an out-of-bounds file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include manifest files from other Applications' source repositories (potentially decrypted files, if you are using a decryption plugin) or any JSON-formatted secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.4, 2.2.9, and 2.1.15. Users of versions 2.3.0 or above who do not have any Jsonnet/directory-type Applications may disable the Jsonnet/directory config management tool as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-35631: On MacOS and Linux, it may be possible to perform a symlink attack by replacing this predictable file name with a symlink to another file and have the Velociraptor client overwrite the other file. This issue was resolved in Velociraptor 0.6.5-2.\n\n- CVE-2022-45440: A vulnerability exists in the FTP server of the Zyxel AX7501-B0 firmware prior to V5.17(ABPC.3)C0, which processes symbolic links on external storage media. A local authenticated attacker with administrator privileges could abuse this vulnerability to access the root file system by creating a symbolic link on external storage media, such as a USB flash drive, and then logging into the FTP server on a vulnerable device.\n\n- CVE-2022-21944: A UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following vulnerability in the systemd service file for watchman of openSUSE Backports SLE-15-SP3, Factory allows local attackers to escalate to root. This issue affects: openSUSE Backports SLE-15-SP3 watchman versions prior to 4.9.0. openSUSE Factory watchman versions prior to 4.9.0-9.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-31250: A UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following vulnerability in keylime of openSUSE Tumbleweed allows local attackers to escalate from the keylime user to root.

Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.\n\n\nA race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:\n\n\n  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.\n\n  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.\n\nA race condition exists when an \"interfering code sequence\" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.\n\nThe interfering code sequence could be \"trusted\" or \"untrusted.\" A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-29527: Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2021-0920: Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-6819: Chain: race condition (CWE-362) leads to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2019-18827: chain: JTAG interface is not disabled (CWE-1191) during ROM code execution, introducing a race condition (CWE-362) to extract encryption keys\n\n- CVE-2019-1161: Chain: race condition (CWE-362) in anti-malware product allows deletion of files by creating a junction (CWE-1386) and using hard links during the time window in which a temporary file is created and deleted.\n\n- CVE-2015-1743: TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed\n\n- CVE-2014-8273: Chain: chipset has a race condition (CWE-362) between when an interrupt handler detects an attempt to write-enable the BIOS (in violation of the lock bit), and when the handler resets the write-enable bit back to 0, allowing attackers to issue BIOS writes during the timing window [REF-1237].\n\n- CVE-2008-5044: Race condition leading to a crash by calling a hook removal procedure while other activities are occurring at the same time.\n\n- CVE-2008-2958: chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.\n\n- CVE-2008-1570: chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.\n\n- CVE-2008-0058: Unsynchronized caching operation enables a race condition that causes messages to be sent to a deallocated object.\n\n- CVE-2008-0379: Race condition during initialization triggers a buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2007-6599: Daemon crash by quickly performing operations and undoing them, which eventually leads to an operation that does not acquire a lock.\n\n- CVE-2007-6180: chain: race condition triggers NULL pointer dereference\n\n- CVE-2007-5794: Race condition in library function could cause data to be sent to the wrong process.\n\n- CVE-2007-3970: Race condition in file parser leads to heap corruption.\n\n- CVE-2008-5021: chain: race condition allows attacker to access an object while it is still being initialized, causing software to access uninitialized memory.\n\n- CVE-2009-4895: chain: race condition for an argument value, possibly resulting in NULL dereference\n\n- CVE-2009-3547: chain: race condition might allow resource to be released before operating on it, leading to NULL dereference\n\n- CVE-2006-5051: Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-6388: Out of bounds access in WebAudio in Google Chrome prior to 80.0.3987.87 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-0366: In vpu, there is a possible memory corruption due to a race condition.

The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, get de-allocated when a guest switched (back) from v2 to v1. The freeing of such pages requires that the hypervisor know where in the guest these pages were mapped. The hypervisor tracks only one use within guest space, but racing requests from the guest to insert mappings of these pages may result in any of them to become mapped in multiple locations. Upon switching back from v2 to v1, the guest would then retain access to a page that was freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes.\n\n- CVE-2021-28701: Another race in XENMAPSPACE_grant_table handling Guests are permitted access to certain Xen-owned pages of memory.

When a BGP flow route with redirect IP extended community is received, and the reachability to the next-hop of the corresponding redirect IP is flapping, the rpd process might crash. Whether the crash occurs depends on the timing of the internally processing of these two events and is outside the attackers control. Please note that this issue also affects Route-Reflectors unless 'routing-options flow firewall-install-disable' is configured. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS: 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S10, 18.4R3-S10; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S7; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S8, 19.2R3-S4; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S8; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S3; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S2; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2.

In affected versions the implementation for `tf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesCreateEnsemble` can result in a use after free error if an attacker supplies specially crafted arguments. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f24faa153ad31a4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/boosted_trees/resource_ops.cc#L55) uses a reference counted resource and decrements the refcount if the initialization fails, as it should. However, when the code was written, the resource was represented as a naked pointer but later refactoring has changed it to be a smart pointer. Thus, when the pointer leaves the scope, a subsequent `free`-ing of the resource occurs, but this fails to take into account that the refcount has already reached 0, thus the resource has been already freed. During this double-free process, members of the resource object are accessed for cleanup but they are invalid as the entire resource has been freed. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 5ecec9c6fbdbc6be03295685190a45e7eee726ab. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0.

The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNorm` is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. If the tensors are empty, the same implementation can trigger undefined behavior by dereferencing null pointers. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/57d86e0db5d1365f19adcce848dfc1bf89fdd4c7/tensorflow/core/kernels/fused_batch_norm_op.cc) fails to validate that `scale`, `offset`, `mean` and `variance` (the last two only when required) all have the same number of elements as the number of channels of `x`. This results in heap out of bounds reads when the buffers backing these tensors are indexed past their boundary. If the tensors are empty, the validation mentioned in the above paragraph would also trigger and prevent the undefined behavior. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29988: Firefox incorrectly treated an inline list-item element as a block element, resulting in an out of bounds read or memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

The function ezxml_parse_str() performs incorrect memory handling while parsing crafted XML files (out-of-bounds read after a certain strcspn failure).\n\n- CVE-2021-32761: Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. A vulnerability involving out-of-bounds read and integer overflow to buffer overflow exists starting with version 2.2 and prior to versions 5.0.13, 6.0.15, and 6.2.5. On 32-bit systems, Redis `*BIT*` command are vulnerable to integer overflow that can potentially be exploited to corrupt the heap, leak arbitrary heap contents or trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter to a very large value and constructing specially crafted commands bit commands. This problem only affects Redis on 32-bit platforms, or compiled as a 32-bit binary. Redis versions 5.0.`3m 6.0.15, and 6.2.5 contain patches for this issue. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the `redis-server` executable is to prevent users from modifying the `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.\n\n- CVE-2021-3409: The patch for CVE-2020-17380/CVE-2020-25085 was found to be ineffective, thus making QEMU vulnerable to the out-of-bounds read/write access issues previously found in the SDHCI controller emulation code. This flaw allows a malicious privileged guest to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service or potential code execution. QEMU up to (including) 5.2.0 is affected by this.\n\n- CVE-2021-3517: There is a flaw in the xml entity encoding functionality of libxml2 in versions before 2.9.11. An attacker who is able to supply a crafted file to be processed by an application linked with the affected functionality of libxml2 could trigger an out-of-bounds read. The most likely impact of this flaw is to application availability, with some potential impact to confidentiality and integrity if an attacker is able to use memory information to further exploit the application.\n\n- CVE-2021-3712: ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2y).\n\n- CVE-2021-31174: Microsoft Excel Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-27408: The affected product is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read, which can cause information leakage leading to arbitrary code execution if chained to the out-of-bounds write vulnerability on the Welch Allyn medical device management tools (Welch Allyn Service Tool: versions prior to v1.10, Welch Allyn Connex Device Integration Suite \u2013 Network Connectivity Engine (NCE): versions prior to v5.3, Welch Allyn Software Development Kit (SDK): versions prior to v3.2, Welch Allyn Connex Central Station (CS): versions prior to v1.8.6, Welch Allyn Service Monitor: versions prior to v1.7.0.0, Welch Allyn Connex Vital Signs Monitor (CVSM): versions prior to v2.43.02, Welch Allyn Connex Integrated Wall System (CIWS): versions prior to v2.43.02, Welch Allyn Connex Spot Monitor (CSM): versions prior to v1.52, Welch Allyn Spot Vital Signs 4400 Device (Spot 4400) / Welch Allyn Spot 4400 Vital Signs Extended Care Device: versions prior to v1.11.00).\n\n- CVE-2021-27791: The function that is used to parse the Authentication header in Brocade Fabric OS Web application service before Brocade Fabric OS v9.0.1a and v8.2.3a fails to properly process a malformed authentication header from the client, resulting in reading memory addresses outside the intended range.

If that file endsin a line with 4095 consecutive non-white space letters and no newline, curlwould first read past the end of the stack-based buffer, and if the readworks, write a zero byte beyond its boundary.This will in most cases cause a segfault or similar, but circumstances might also cause different outcomes.If a malicious user can provide a custom netrc file to an application or otherwise affect its contents, this flaw could be used as denial-of-service.\n\n- CVE-2022-39392: Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to version 2.0.2, there is a bug in Wasmtime's implementation of its pooling instance allocator when the allocator is configured to give WebAssembly instances a maximum of zero pages of memory. In this configuration, the virtual memory mapping for WebAssembly memories did not meet the compiler-required configuration requirements for safely executing WebAssembly modules. Wasmtime's default settings require virtual memory page faults to indicate that wasm reads/writes are out-of-bounds, but the pooling allocator's configuration would not create an appropriate virtual memory mapping for this meaning out of bounds reads/writes can successfully read/write memory unrelated to the wasm sandbox within range of the base address of the memory mapping created by the pooling allocator. This bug is not applicable with the default settings of the `wasmtime` crate. This bug can only be triggered by setting `InstanceLimits::memory_pages` to zero. This is expected to be a very rare configuration since this means that wasm modules cannot allocate any pages of linear memory. All wasm modules produced by all current toolchains are highly likely to use linear memory, so it's expected to be unlikely that this configuration is set to zero by any production embedding of Wasmtime. This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2. This bug can be worked around by increasing the `memory_pages` allotment when configuring the pooling allocator to a value greater than zero. If an embedding wishes to still prevent memory from actually being used then the `Store::limiter` method can be used to dynamically disallow growth of memory beyond 0 bytes large. Note that the default `memory_pages` value is greater than zero.\n\n- CVE-2022-41902: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The function MakeGrapplerFunctionItem takes arguments that determine the sizes of inputs and outputs. If the inputs given are greater than or equal to the sizes of the outputs, an out-of-bounds memory read or a crash is triggered. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit a65411a1d69edfb16b25907ffb8f73556ce36bb7. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.8.4, 2.9.3, and 2.10.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-41981: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the TGA file format parser of OpenImageIO v2.3.19.0. A specially-crafted targa file can lead to out of bounds read and write on the process stack, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-4203: A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. In theory it could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext) although we are not aware of any working exploit leading to memory contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects. \n\n- CVE-2022-48303: GNU Tar through 1.34 has a one-byte out-of-bounds read that results in use of uninitialized memory for a conditional jump.

If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-2639: Chain: integer coercion error (CWE-192) prevents a return value from indicating an error, leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)\n\n- CVE-2021-43537: Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n\n- CVE-2007-4268: Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)\n\n- CVE-2007-4988: Chain: signed short width value in image processor is sign extended during conversion to unsigned int, which leads to integer overflow and heap-based buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2009-0231: Integer truncation of length value leads to heap-based buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2008-3282: Size of a particular type changes for 64-bit platforms, leading to an integer truncation in document processor causes incorrect index to be generated.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-23997: Due to unexpected data type conversions, a use-after-free could have occurred when interacting with the font cache.

In affected versions the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad` is vulnerable to an integer overflow issue caused by converting a signed integer value to an unsigned one and then allocating memory based on this value. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.cc#L126) uses the `axis` value as the size argument to `absl::InlinedVector` constructor. But, the constructor uses an unsigned type for the argument, so the implicit conversion transforms the negative value to a large integer. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 96f364a1ca3009f98980021c4b32be5fdcca33a1. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, and TensorFlow 2.4.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-37646: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams` is vulnerable to an integer overflow issue caused by converting a signed integer value to an unsigned one and then allocating memory based on this value.

The `reserve` method calls `TF_TString_Reserve` which has an `unsigned long` argument for the size of the buffer. Hence, the implicit conversion transforms the negative value to a large integer. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit c283e542a3f422420cfdb332414543b62fc4e4a5. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0.

In versions prior to 1.3.0 there exists a DoS vulnerability that is possible due to a bug in the library that would allow an attacker with specifically designed queries to cause stack overflow panics. Any user with access to the GraphQL handler can send these queries and cause stack overflows. This in turn could potentially compromise the ability of the server to serve data to its users. The issue has been patched in version `v1.3.0`. The only known workaround for this issue is to disable the `graphql.MaxDepth` option from your schema which is not recommended.\n\n- CVE-2022-23591: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The `GraphDef` format in TensorFlow does not allow self recursive functions. The runtime assumes that this invariant is satisfied. However, a `GraphDef` containing a fragment such as the following can be consumed when loading a `SavedModel`. This would result in a stack overflow during execution as resolving each `NodeDef` means resolving the function itself and its nodes. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-24675: encoding/pem in Go before 1.17.9 and 1.18.x before 1.18.1 has a Decode stack overflow via a large amount of PEM data.\n\n- CVE-2022-31019: Vapor is a server-side Swift HTTP web framework. When using automatic content decoding an attacker can craft a request body that can make the server crash with the following request: `curl -d \"array[_0][0][array][_0][0][array]$(for f in $(seq 1100); do echo -n '[_0][0][array]'; done)[string][_0]=hello%20world\" http://localhost:8080/foo`. The issue is unbounded, attacker controlled stack growth which will at some point lead to a stack overflow and a process crash. This issue has been fixed in version 4.61.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-31099: rulex is a new, portable, regular expression language. When parsing untrusted rulex expressions, the stack may overflow, possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when parsing an expression with several hundred levels of nesting, causing the process to abort immediately. This is a security concern for you, if your service parses untrusted rulex expressions (expressions provided by an untrusted user), and your service becomes unavailable when the process running rulex aborts due to a stack overflow. The crash is fixed in version **0.4.3**. Affected users are advised to update to this version. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-3216: A vulnerability has been found in Nintendo Game Boy Color and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the component Mobile Adapter GB. The manipulation leads to memory corruption. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. VDB-208606 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-38334: XPDF v4.04 and earlier was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the function Catalog::countPageTree() at Catalog.cc.\n\n- CVE-2022-41966: XStream serializes Java objects to XML and back again. Versions prior to 1.4.20 may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error, resulting in a denial of service only via manipulation the processed input stream. The attack uses the hash code implementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash calculation causing a stack overflow. This issue is patched in version 1.4.20 which handles the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead. A potential workaround for users who only use HashMap or HashSet and whose XML refers these only as default map or set, is to change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util per the code example in the referenced advisory. However, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.\n\n- CVE-2022-47662: GPAC MP4Box 2.1-DEV-rev649-ga8f438d20 has a segment fault (/stack overflow) due to infinite recursion in Media_GetSample isomedia/media.c:662\n\n- CVE-2022-23460: Jsonxx or Json++ is a JSON parser, writer and reader written in C++. In affected versions of jsonxx json parsing may lead to stack exhaustion in an address sanitized (ASAN) build. This issue may lead to Denial of Service if the program using the jsonxx library crashes. This issue exists on the current commit of the jsonxx project and the project itself has been archived. Updates are not expected. Users are advised to find a replacement.\n\n- CVE-2022-23606: Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications. When a cluster is deleted via Cluster Discovery Service (CDS) all idle connections established to endpoints in that cluster are disconnected. A recursion was introduced in the procedure of disconnecting idle connections that can lead to stack exhaustion and abnormal process termination when a cluster has a large number of idle connections. This infinite recursion causes Envoy to crash. Users are advised to upgrade.\n\n- CVE-2022-24921: regexp.Compile in Go before 1.16.15 and 1.17.x before 1.17.8 allows stack exhaustion via a deeply nested expression.\n\n- CVE-2022-25313: In Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5, an attacker can trigger stack exhaustion in build_model via a large nesting depth in the DTD element.\n\n- CVE-2022-27810: It was possible to trigger an infinite recursion condition in the error handler when Hermes executed specific maliciously formed JavaScript. This condition was only possible to trigger in dev-mode (when asserts were enabled).

    "enhanced_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nIn the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved scsi ufs core Fix another **deadlock** during RTC update If ufshcd_rtc_work calls ufshcd_rpm_put_sync() and the pms usage_count is 0, we will enter the runtime suspend callback. However, the runtime suspend callback will wait to flush ufshcd_rtc_work, causing a **deadlock**. Replace ufshcd_rpm_put_sync() with ufshcd_rpm_put() to avoid the **deadlock**.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **weakness:** **deadlock**\n- **impact:** runtime suspend callback\n- **vector:** ufshcd_rtc_work calls ufshcd_rpm_put_sync() when the pms usage_count is 0\n- **product:** Linux kernel\n- **component:** scsi ufs core\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- A deadlock occurs in the UFS (Universal Flash Storage) subsystem when updating the Real-Time Clock (RTC).\n\n**Vulnerabilities:**\n- The function `ufshcd_update_rtc` calls `ufshcd_rpm_put_sync()`.\n- If the power management (PM) usage count is 0, `ufshcd_rpm_put_sync()` will trigger the runtime suspend callback.\n- The runtime suspend callback waits for `ufshcd_rtc_work` to complete (flush), but `ufshcd_rtc_work` itself is blocked on `ufshcd_rpm_put_sync()`, creating a deadlock condition.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- The system will become unresponsive due to the deadlock.\n- The UFS storage operations will be stalled.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The vulnerability is triggered by the normal operation of the UFS driver, specifically during the RTC update process. No specific attacker action is needed to trigger the bug.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- No specific attacker capabilities or position is required. The vulnerability can be triggered by the system itself.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- The fix replaces `ufshcd_rpm_put_sync()` with `ufshcd_rpm_put()`. The `ufshcd_rpm_put` function does not wait for the power management operation to complete synchronously, avoiding the deadlock.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The fix was backported to stable kernel versions, including 6.11.x.\n- The issue was introduced by commit `6bf999e0eb41 (\"scsi: ufs: core: Add UFS RTC support\")`.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 667 | Improper Locking | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.324 |\n| 2 | 833 | Deadlock | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.297 |\n| 3 | 835 | Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.236 |\n| 4 | 663 | Use of a Non-reentrant Function in a Concurrent Context | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.234 |\n| 5 | 61 | UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following | Compound | Allowed | sparse | 0.229 |\n| 6 | 413 | Improper Resource Locking | Base | Allowed | dense | 0.488 |\n| 7 | 772 | Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 1281 | Sequence of Processor Instructions Leads to Unexpected Behavior | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.219 |\n| 9 | 362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.214 |\n| 10 | 415 | Double Free | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.214 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nLocking is a type of synchronization behavior that ensures that multiple independently-operating processes or threads do not interfere with each other when accessing the same resource. All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\nChildOf -> CWE-662\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** Deeper research is necessary for synchronization and related mechanisms, including locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other mechanisms. Multiple entries are dependent on this research, which includes relationships to concurrency, race conditions, reentrant functions, etc. CWE-662 and its children - including CWE-667, CWE-820, CWE-821, and others - may need to be modified significantly, along with their relationships.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2009-0935:** Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice\n- **CVE-2010-4210:** function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-833: Deadlock\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-667\nChildOf -> CWE-662\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

This could allow an attacker to cause the product to operate on unauthorized files.\n\n### Extended Description\nA product that allows UNIX symbolic links (symlink) as part of paths whether in internal code or through user input can allow an attacker to spoof the symbolic link and traverse the file system to unintended locations or access arbitrary files. The symbolic link can permit an attacker to read/write/corrupt a file that they originally did not have permissions to access.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nSymlink following\nsymlink vulnerability\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-59\nRequires -> CWE-362\nRequires -> CWE-340\nRequires -> CWE-386\nRequires -> CWE-732\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n**Comments:** While attack-oriented composites are supported in CWE, they have not been a focus of research. There is a chance that future research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine which weaknesses allow symlink following to occur, and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable file names might be intended functionality, but creation in a directory with insecure permissions might not.\n**Reasons:**\n- Other\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nSymlink vulnerabilities are regularly found in C and shell programs, but all programming languages can have this problem. Even shell programs are probably under-reported.\n\n\n\"Second-order symlink vulnerabilities\" may exist in programs that invoke other programs that follow symlinks. They are rarely reported but are likely to be fairly common when process invocation is used [REF-493].\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1386:** Some versions of Perl follow symbolic links when running with the -e option, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.\n- **CVE-2000-1178:** Text editor follows symbolic links when creating a rescue copy during an abnormal exit, which allows local users to overwrite the files of other users.\n- **CVE-2004-0217:** Antivirus update allows local users to create or append to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a logfile.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not lock or does not correctly lock a resource when the product must have exclusive access to the resource.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a resource is not properly locked, an attacker could modify the resource while it is being operated on by the product. This might violate the product's assumption that the resource will not change, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-667\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-20141:** Chain: an operating system kernel has insufficent resource locking (CWE-413) leading to a use after free (CWE-416).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the resource is no longer needed.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a resource is not released after use, it can allow attackers to cause a denial of service by causing the allocation of resources without triggering their release. Frequently-affected resources include memory, CPU, disk space, power or battery, etc.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-404\nChildOf -> CWE-404\nChildOf -> CWE-404\nChildOf -> CWE-404\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** \"Resource exhaustion\" (CWE-400) is currently treated as a weakness, although it is more like a category of weaknesses that all have the same type of consequence. While this entry treats CWE-400 as a parent in view 1000, the relationship is probably more appropriately described as a chain.\n\n**[Theoretical]** Vulnerability theory is largely about how behaviors and resources interact. \"Resource exhaustion\" can be regarded as either a consequence or an attack, depending on the perspective. This entry is an attempt to reflect one of the underlying weaknesses that enable these attacks (or consequences) to take place.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2007-0897:** Chain: anti-virus product encounters a malformed file but returns from a function without closing a file descriptor (CWE-775) leading to file descriptor consumption (CWE-400) and failed scans.\n- **CVE-2001-0830:** Sockets not properly closed when attacker repeatedly connects and disconnects from server.\n- **CVE-1999-1127:** Does not shut down named pipe connections if malformed data is sent.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1281: Sequence of Processor Instructions Leads to Unexpected Behavior\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nSpecific combinations of processor instructions lead to undesirable behavior such as locking the processor until a hard reset performed.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nIf the instruction set architecture (ISA) and processor logic are not designed carefully and tested thoroughly, certain combinations of instructions may lead to locking the processor or other unexpected and undesirable behavior. Upon encountering unimplemented instruction opcodes or illegal instruction operands, the processor should throw an exception and carry on without negatively impacting security. However, specific combinations of legal and illegal instructions may cause unexpected behavior with security implications such as allowing unprivileged programs to completely lock the CPU. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-691\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-26339:** A bug in AMD CPU's core logic allows a potential DoS by using a specific x86 instruction sequence to hang the processor\n- **CVE-1999-1476:** A bug in some Intel Pentium processors allow DoS (hang) via an invalid \"CMPXCHG8B\" instruction, causing a deadlock\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nA race condition occurs within concurrent environments, and it is effectively a property of a code sequence. Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.\n\n\nA race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:\n\n\n  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.\n\n  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.\n\nA race condition exists when an \"interfering code sequence\" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.\n\nThe interfering code sequence could be \"trusted\" or \"untrusted.\" A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nRace Condition\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-691\nCanPrecede -> CWE-416\nCanPrecede -> CWE-476\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** The relationship between race conditions and synchronization problems (CWE-662) needs to be further developed. They are not necessarily two perspectives of the same core concept, since synchronization is only one technique for avoiding race conditions, and synchronization can be used for other purposes besides race condition prevention.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Race conditions in web applications are under-studied and probably under-reported. However, in 2008 there has been growing interest in this area.\n\n**[Research Gap]** Much of the focus of race condition research has been in Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) variants (CWE-367), but many race conditions are related to synchronization problems that do not necessarily require a time-of-check.\n\n**[Research Gap]** From a classification/taxonomy perspective, the relationships between concurrency and program state need closer investigation and may be useful in organizing related issues.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-29527:** Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n- **CVE-2021-1782:** Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2021-0920:** Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-415: Double Free\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhen a program calls free() twice with the same argument, the program's memory management data structures become corrupted. This corruption can cause the program to crash or, in some circumstances, cause two later calls to malloc() to return the same pointer. If malloc() returns the same value twice and the program later gives the attacker control over the data that is written into this doubly-allocated memory, the program becomes vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDouble-free\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-825\nChildOf -> CWE-1341\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-672\nChildOf -> CWE-666\nPeerOf -> CWE-416\nPeerOf -> CWE-123\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is usually resultant from another weakness, such as an unhandled error or race condition between threads. It could also be primary to weaknesses such as buffer overflows.\n\n**[Theoretical]** It could be argued that Double Free would be most appropriately located as a child of \"Use after Free\", but \"Use\" and \"Release\" are considered to be distinct operations within vulnerability theory, therefore this is more accurately \"Release of a Resource after Expiration or Release\", which doesn't exist yet.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2006-5051:** Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n- **CVE-2004-0642:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n- **CVE-2004-0772:** Double free resultant from certain error conditions.\n\n",

All processes/threads are expected to follow the same steps for locking. If these steps are not followed precisely - or if no locking is done at all - then another process/thread could modify the shared resource in a way that is not visible or predictable to the original process. This can lead to data or memory corruption, denial of service, etc.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2009-0935: Attacker provides invalid address to a memory-reading function, causing a mutex to be unlocked twice\n\n- CVE-2010-4210: function in OS kernel unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, causing a panic or overwrite of arbitrary memory.\n\n- CVE-2008-4302: Chain: OS kernel does not properly handle a failure of a function call (CWE-755), leading to an unlock of a resource that was not locked (CWE-832), with resultant crash.\n\n- CVE-2009-1243: OS kernel performs an unlock in some incorrect circumstances, leading to panic.\n\n- CVE-2009-2857: OS deadlock\n\n- CVE-2009-1961: OS deadlock involving 3 separate functions\n\n- CVE-2009-2699: deadlock in library\n\n- CVE-2009-4272: deadlock triggered by packets that force collisions in a routing table\n\n- CVE-2002-1850: read/write deadlock between web server and script\n\n- CVE-2004-0174: web server deadlock involving multiple listening connections\n\n- CVE-2009-1388: multiple simultaneous calls to the same function trigger deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2006-5158: chain: other weakness leads to NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) or deadlock (CWE-833).\n\n- CVE-2006-4342: deadlock when an operation is performed on a resource while it is being removed.\n\n- CVE-2006-2374: Deadlock in device driver triggered by using file handle of a related device.\n\n- CVE-2006-2275: Deadlock when large number of small messages cannot be processed quickly enough.\n\n- CVE-2005-3847: OS kernel has deadlock triggered by a signal during a core dump.\n\n- CVE-2005-3106: Race condition leads to deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2005-2456: Chain: array index error (CWE-129) leads to deadlock (CWE-833)\n\n- CVE-2001-0682: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a mutex.\n\n- CVE-2002-1914: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.\n\n- CVE-2002-1915: Program can not execute when attacker obtains a lock on a critical output file.\n\n- CVE-2002-0051: Critical file can be opened with exclusive read access by user, preventing application of security policy. Possibly related to improper permissions, large-window race condition.\n\n- CVE-2000-0338: Chain: predictable file names used for locking, allowing attacker to create the lock beforehand. Resultant from permissions and randomness.\n\n- CVE-2000-1198: Chain: Lock files with predictable names. Resultant from randomness.\n\n- CVE-2002-1869: Product does not check if it can write to a log file, allowing attackers to avoid logging by accessing the file using an exclusive lock. Overlaps unchecked error condition. This is not quite CWE-412, but close.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0529: In memory management driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android SoCAndroid ID: A-185195268\n\n- CVE-2021-0625: In ccu, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS05594996; Issue ID: ALPS05594996.\n\n- CVE-2020-27014: Trend Micro Antivirus for Mac 2020 (Consumer) contains a race condition vulnerability in the Web Threat Protection Blocklist component, that if exploited, could allow an attacker to case a kernel panic or crash.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nAn attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: A race condition was addressed with improved locking. This issue is fixed in macOS Big Sur 11.2, Security Update 2021-001 Catalina, Security Update 2021-001 Mojave, watchOS 7.3, tvOS 14.4, iOS 14.4 and iPadOS 14.4. A malicious application may be able to elevate privileges. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited..\n\n- CVE-2021-31961: Windows InstallService Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26708: A local privilege escalation was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.10.13. Multiple race conditions in the AF_VSOCK implementation are caused by wrong locking in net/vmw_vsock/af_vsock.c. The race conditions were implicitly introduced in the commits that added VSOCK multi-transport support.\n\n- CVE-2021-0330: In add_user_ce and remove_user_ce of storaged.cpp, there is a possible use-after-free due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in storaged with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-9 Android-10 Android-11Android ID: A-170732441\n\n- CVE-2021-0940: In TBD of TBD, there is a possible out of bounds write due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege in the kernel with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android kernelAndroid ID: A-171315276References: N/A\n\n- CVE-2021-26312: Failure to flush the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) of the I/O memory management unit (IOMMU) may lead an IO device to write to memory it should not be able to access, resulting in a potential loss of integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-29509: Puma is a concurrent HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications. The fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris). The fix is very small and a git patch is available for those using unsupported versions of Puma.\n\n- CVE-2021-4001: A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's ebpf verifier between bpf_map_update_elem and bpf_map_freeze due to a missing lock in kernel/bpf/syscall.c. In this flaw, a local user with a special privilege (cap_sys_admin or cap_bpf) can modify the frozen mapped address space. This flaw affects kernel versions prior to 5.16 rc2.\n\n- CVE-2021-41141: PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in the C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In various parts of PJSIP, when error/failure occurs, it is found that the function returns without releasing the currently held locks. This could result in a system deadlock, which cause a denial of service for the users. No release has yet been made which contains the linked fix commit. All versions up to an including 2.11.1 are affected. Users may need to manually apply the patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-4149: A vulnerability was found in btrfs_alloc_tree_b in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c in the Linux kernel due to an improper lock operation in btrfs. In this flaw, a user with a local privilege may cause a denial of service (DOS) due to a deadlock problem.\n\n- CVE-2022-20016: In vow driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS05862986; Issue ID: ALPS05862986.\n\n- CVE-2022-21775: In sched driver, there is a possible use after free due to improper locking.

Patch ID: ALPS07342197; Issue ID: ALPS07342197.\n\n- CVE-2022-32811: A memory corruption vulnerability was addressed with improved locking. This issue is fixed in macOS Monterey 12.5, macOS Big Sur 11.6.8, Security Update 2022-005 Catalina. An app may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.\n\n- CVE-2022-39131: In camera driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local denial of service in kernel.\n\n- CVE-2022-42775: In camera driver, there is a possible memory corruption due to improper locking. This could lead to local denial of service in kernel.\n\n- CVE-2022-26356: Racy interactions between dirty vram tracking and paging log dirty hypercalls Activation of log dirty mode done by XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram (was named HVMOP_track_dirty_vram before Xen 4.9) is racy with ongoing log dirty hypercalls. A suitably timed call to XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram can enable log dirty while another CPU is still in the process of tearing down the structures related to a previously enabled log dirty mode (XEN_DOMCTL_SHADOW_OP_OFF). This is due to lack of mutually exclusive locking between both operations and can lead to entries being added in already freed slots, resulting in a memory leak.\n\n- CVE-2021-0147: Improper locking in the Power Management Controller (PMC) for some Intel Chipset firmware before versions pmc_fw_lbg_c1-21ww02a and pmc_fw_lbg_b0-21ww02a may allow a privileged user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-39640: In __dwc3_gadget_ep0_queue of ep0.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to improper locking. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed.

This vulnerability is due to a deadlock condition in the code when processing COPS packets under certain conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending COPS packets with high burst rates to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the CPU to consume excessive resources, which prevents other control plane processes from obtaining resources and results in a DoS.\n\n- CVE-2021-20291: A deadlock vulnerability was found in 'github.com/containers/storage' in versions before 1.28.1. When a container image is processed, each layer is unpacked using `tar`. If one of those layers is not a valid `tar` archive this causes an error leading to an unexpected situation where the code indefinitely waits for the tar unpacked stream, which never finishes. An attacker could use this vulnerability to craft a malicious image, which when downloaded and stored by an application using containers/storage, would then cause a deadlock leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n- CVE-2021-28951: An issue was discovered in fs/io_uring.c in the Linux kernel through 5.11.8. It allows attackers to cause a denial of service (deadlock) because exit may be waiting to park a SQPOLL thread, but concurrently that SQPOLL thread is waiting for a signal to start, aka CID-3ebba796fa25.\n\n- CVE-2021-31611: The Bluetooth Classic implementation on Zhuhai Jieli AC690X and AC692X devices does not properly handle an out-of-order LMP Setup procedure that is followed by a malformed LMP packet, allowing attackers in radio range to deadlock a device via a crafted LMP packet. The user needs to manually reboot the device to restore communication.\n\n- CVE-2021-31785: The Bluetooth Classic implementation on Actions ATS2815 and ATS2819 chipsets does not properly handle the reception of multiple LMP_host_connection_req packets, allowing attackers in radio range to trigger a denial of service (deadlock) of the device via crafted LMP packets. Manual user intervention is required to restart the device and restore Bluetooth communication.\n\n- CVE-2021-38203: btrfs in the Linux kernel before 5.13.4 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (deadlock) via processes that trigger allocation of new system chunks during times when there is a shortage of free space in the system space_info.\n\n- CVE-2021-31786: The Bluetooth Classic Audio implementation on Actions ATS2815 and ATS2819 devices does not properly handle a connection attempt from a host with the same BDAddress as the current connected BT host, allowing attackers to trigger a disconnection and deadlock of the device by connecting with a forged BDAddress that matches the original connected host.\n\n- CVE-2021-3499: A vulnerability was found in OVN Kubernetes in versions up to and including 0.3.0 where the Egress Firewall does not reliably apply firewall rules when there is multiple DNS rules. It could lead to potentially lose of confidentiality, integrity or availability of a service.\n\n- CVE-2021-3735: A deadlock issue was found in the AHCI controller device of QEMU. It occurs on a software reset (ahci_reset_port) while handling a host-to-device Register FIS (Frame Information Structure) packet from the guest. A privileged user inside the guest could use this flaw to hang the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-43395: An issue was discovered in illumos before f859e7171bb5db34321e45585839c6c3200ebb90, OmniOS Community Edition r151038, OpenIndiana Hipster 2021.04, and SmartOS 20210923. A local unprivileged user can cause a deadlock and kernel panic via crafted rename and rmdir calls on tmpfs filesystems. Oracle Solaris 10 and 11 is also affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-31621: MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. In extra/mariabackup/ds_xbstream.cc, when an error occurs (stream_ctxt->dest_file == NULL) while executing the method xbstream_open, the held lock is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock. Note: The vendor argues this is just an improper locking bug and not a vulnerability with adverse effects.\n\n- CVE-2022-31622: MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. In extra/mariabackup/ds_compress.cc, when an error occurs (pthread_create returns a nonzero value) while executing the method create_worker_threads, the held lock is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock. Note: The vendor argues this is just an improper locking bug and not a vulnerability with adverse effects.\n\n- CVE-2022-31623: MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. In extra/mariabackup/ds_compress.cc, when an error occurs (i.e., going to the err label) while executing the method create_worker_threads, the held lock thd->ctrl_mutex is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock. Note: The vendor argues this is just an improper locking bug and not a vulnerability with adverse effects.\n\n- CVE-2022-31624: MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. While executing the plugin/server_audit/server_audit.c method log_statement_ex, the held lock lock_bigbuffer is not released correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2022-38791: In MariaDB before 10.9.2, compress_write in extra/mariabackup/ds_compress.cc does not release data_mutex upon a stream write failure, which allows local users to trigger a deadlock.\n\n- CVE-2022-42328: Guests can trigger deadlock in Linux netback driver T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] The patch for XSA-392 introduced another issue which might result in a deadlock when trying to free the SKB of a packet dropped due to the XSA-392 handling (CVE-2022-42328).

TFlite graphs must not have loops between nodes. However, this condition was not checked and an attacker could craft models that would result in infinite loop during evaluation. In certain cases, the infinite loop would be replaced by stack overflow due to too many recursive calls. For example, the `While` implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/106d8f4fb89335a2c52d7c895b7a7485465ca8d9/tensorflow/lite/kernels/while.cc) could be tricked into a scneario where both the body and the loop subgraphs are the same. Evaluating one of the subgraphs means calling the `Eval` function for the other and this quickly exhaust all stack space. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range. Please consult our security guide(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n- CVE-2021-3416: A potential stack overflow via infinite loop issue was found in various NIC emulators of QEMU in versions up to and including 5.2.0. The issue occurs in loopback mode of a NIC wherein reentrant DMA checks get bypassed. A guest user/process may use this flaw to consume CPU cycles or crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario.\n\n- CVE-2021-39194: kaml is an open source implementation of the YAML format with support for kotlinx.serialization. In affected versions attackers that could provide arbitrary YAML input to an application that uses kaml could cause the application to endlessly loop while parsing the input. This could result in resource starvation and denial of service. This only affects applications that use polymorphic serialization with the default tagged polymorphism style. Applications using the property polymorphism style are not affected. YAML input for a polymorphic type that provided a tag but no value for the object would trigger the issue. Version 0.35.3 or later contain the fix for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-1252: A vulnerability in the Excel XLM macro parsing module in Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.103.0 and 0.103.1 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper error handling that may result in an infinite loop. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Excel file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process hang, resulting in a denial of service condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-21235: kamadak-exif is an exif parsing library written in pure Rust. In kamadak-exif version 0.5.2, there is an infinite loop in parsing crafted PNG files. Specifically, reader::read_from_container can cause an infinite loop when a crafted PNG file is given. This is fixed in version 0.5.3. No workaround is available. Applications that do not pass files with the PNG signature to Reader::read_from_container are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2021-27385: A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC HMI Comfort Outdoor Panels V15 7\\\\\" & 15\\\\\" (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V15.1 Update 6), SIMATIC HMI Comfort Outdoor Panels V16 7\\\\\" & 15\\\\\" (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V16 Update 4), SIMATIC HMI Comfort Panels V15 4\\\\\" - 22\\\\\" (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V15.1 Update 6), SIMATIC HMI Comfort Panels V16 4\\\\\" - 22\\\\\" (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V16 Update 4), SIMATIC HMI KTP Mobile Panels V15 KTP400F, KTP700, KTP700F, KTP900 and KTP900F (All versions < V15.1 Update 6), SIMATIC HMI KTP Mobile Panels V16 KTP400F, KTP700, KTP700F, KTP900 and KTP900F (All versions < V16 Update 4), SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Advanced V15 (All versions < V15.1 Update 6), SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Advanced V16 (All versions < V16 Update 4), SINAMICS GH150 (All versions), SINAMICS GL150 (with option X30) (All versions), SINAMICS GM150 (with option X30) (All versions), SINAMICS SH150 (All versions), SINAMICS SL150 (All versions), SINAMICS SM120 (All versions), SINAMICS SM150 (All versions), SINAMICS SM150i (All versions). A remote attacker could send specially crafted packets to SmartVNC device layout handler on client side, which could influence the amount of resources consumed and result in a Denial-of-Service (infinite loop) condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-27807: A carefully crafted PDF file can trigger an infinite loop while loading the file. This issue affects Apache PDFBox version 2.0.22 and prior 2.0.x versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-30468: A vulnerability in the JsonMapObjectReaderWriter of Apache CXF allows an attacker to submit malformed JSON to a web service, which results in the thread getting stuck in an infinite loop, consuming CPU indefinitely. This issue affects Apache CXF versions prior to 3.4.4; Apache CXF versions prior to 3.3.11.\n\n- CVE-2021-31812: In Apache PDFBox, a carefully crafted PDF file can trigger an infinite loop while loading the file. This issue affects Apache PDFBox version 2.0.23 and prior 2.0.x versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-35515: When reading a specially crafted 7Z archive, the construction of the list of codecs that decompress an entry can result in an infinite loop. This could be used to mount a denial of service attack against services that use Compress' sevenz package.\n\n- CVE-2021-38387: In Contiki 3.0, a Telnet server that silently quits (before disconnection with clients) leads to connected clients entering an infinite loop and waiting forever, which may cause excessive CPU consumption.\n\n- CVE-2021-43172: NLnet Labs Routinator prior to 0.10.2 happily processes a chain of RRDP repositories of infinite length causing it to never finish a validation run. In RPKI, a CA can choose the RRDP repository it wishes to publish its data in. By continuously generating a new child CA that only consists of another CA using a different RRDP repository, a malicious CA can create a chain of CAs of de-facto infinite length. Routinator prior to version 0.10.2 did not contain a limit on the length of such a chain and will therefore continue to process this chain forever. As a result, the validation run will never finish, leading to Routinator continuing to serve the old data set or, if in the initial validation run directly after starting, never serve any data at all.\n\n- CVE-2020-12655: An issue was discovered in xfs_agf_verify in fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_alloc.c in the Linux kernel through 5.6.10. Attackers may trigger a sync of excessive duration via an XFS v5 image with crafted metadata, aka CID-d0c7feaf8767.\n\n- CVE-2021-3679: A lack of CPU resource in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality in versions prior to 5.14-rc3 was found in the way user uses trace ring buffer in a specific way. Only privileged local users (with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) could use this flaw to starve the resources causing denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2021-3908: OctoRPKI does not limit the depth of a certificate chain, allowing for a CA to create children in an ad-hoc fashion, thereby making tree traversal never end.\n\n- CVE-2021-4182: Crash in the RFC 7468 dissector in Wireshark 3.6.0 and 3.4.0 to 3.4.10 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file\n\n- CVE-2021-3737: A flaw was found in python. An improperly handled HTTP response in the HTTP client code of python may allow a remote attacker, who controls the HTTP server, to make the client script enter an infinite loop, consuming CPU time. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-24191: In HTMLDOC 1.9.14, an infinite loop in the gif_read_lzw function can lead to a pointer arbitrarily pointing to heap memory and resulting in a buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2022-23437: There's a vulnerability within the Apache Xerces Java (XercesJ) XML parser when handling specially crafted XML document payloads. This causes, the XercesJ XML parser to wait in an infinite loop, which may sometimes consume system resources for prolonged duration. This vulnerability is present within XercesJ version 2.12.1 and the previous versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-23641: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. In versions prior to 2.8.1 in the `stable` branch, 2.9.0.beta2 in the `beta` branch, and 2.9.0.beta2 in the `tests-passed` branch, users can trigger a Denial of Service attack by posting a streaming URL. Parsing Oneboxes in the background job trigger an infinite loop, which cause memory leaks. This issue is patched in version 2.8.1 of the `stable` branch, 2.9.0.beta2 of the `beta` branch, and 2.9.0.beta2 of the `tests-passed` branch. As a workaround, disable onebox in admin panel completely or specify allow list of domains that will be oneboxed.\n\n- CVE-2022-31628: In PHP versions before 7.4.31, 8.0.24 and 8.1.11, the phar uncompressor code would recursively uncompress \"quines\" gzip files, resulting in an infinite loop.\n\n- CVE-2022-46770: qubes-mirage-firewall (aka Mirage firewall for QubesOS) 0.8.x through 0.8.3 allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and loss of forwarding) via a crafted multicast UDP packet (IP address range of 224.0.0.0 through 239.255.255.255).\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-834 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-834 (ChildOf)",

SUSE OpenStack Cloud Crowbar 9 arpwatch versions prior to 2.1a15. openSUSE Factory arpwatch version 2.1a15-169.5 and prior versions. openSUSE Leap 15.2 arpwatch version 2.1a15-lp152.5.5 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-25322: A UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following vulnerability in python-HyperKitty of openSUSE Leap 15.2, Factory allows local attackers to escalate privileges from the user hyperkitty or hyperkitty-admin to root. This issue affects: openSUSE Leap 15.2 python-HyperKitty version 1.3.2-lp152.2.3.1 and prior versions. openSUSE Factory python-HyperKitty versions prior to 1.3.4-5.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-31997: A UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following vulnerability in python-postorius of openSUSE Leap 15.2, Factory allows local attackers to escalate from users postorius or postorius-admin to root. This issue affects: openSUSE Leap 15.2 python-postorius version 1.3.2-lp152.1.2 and prior versions. openSUSE Factory python-postorius version 1.3.4-2.1 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-32000: A UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following vulnerability in the clone-master-clean-up.sh script of clone-master-clean-up in SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP3, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP1; openSUSE Factory allows local attackers to delete arbitrary files.

This is accomplished by extracting package contents into a project's `node_modules` folder. If the `node_modules` folder of the root project or any of its dependencies is somehow replaced with a symbolic link, it could allow Arborist to write package dependencies to any arbitrary location on the file system. Note that symbolic links contained within package artifact contents are filtered out, so another means of creating a `node_modules` symbolic link would have to be employed. 1. A `preinstall` script could replace `node_modules` with a symlink. (This is prevented by using `--ignore-scripts`.) 2. An attacker could supply the target with a git repository, instructing them to run `npm install --ignore-scripts` in the root. This may be successful, because `npm install --ignore-scripts` is typically not capable of making changes outside of the project directory, so it may be deemed safe. This is patched in @npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above. For more information including workarounds please see the referenced GHSA-gmw6-94gg-2rc2.\n\n- CVE-2021-1612: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software CLI could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the local system. This vulnerability is due to improper access controls on files within the local file system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a symbolic link in a specific location on the local file system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on an affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-26089: An improper symlink following in FortiClient for Mac 6.4.3 and below may allow an non-privileged user to execute arbitrary privileged shell commands during installation phase.\n\n- CVE-2022-20720: Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOx application hosting environment on multiple Cisco platforms could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying host operating system, execute arbitrary code on the underlying host operating system, install applications without being authenticated, or conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the affected software. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2022-26612: In Apache Hadoop, The unTar function uses unTarUsingJava function on Windows and the built-in tar utility on Unix and other OSes. As a result, a TAR entry may create a symlink under the expected extraction directory which points to an external directory. A subsequent TAR entry may extract an arbitrary file into the external directory using the symlink name. This however would be caught by the same targetDirPath check on Unix because of the getCanonicalPath call. However on Windows, getCanonicalPath doesn't resolve symbolic links, which bypasses the check. unpackEntries during TAR extraction follows symbolic links which allows writing outside expected base directory on Windows. This was addressed in Apache Hadoop 3.2.3\n\n- CVE-2022-3592: A symlink following vulnerability was found in Samba, where a user can create a symbolic link that will make 'smbd' escape the configured share path. This flaw allows a remote user with access to the exported part of the file system under a share via SMB1 unix extensions or NFS to create symlinks to files outside the 'smbd' configured share path and gain access to another restricted server's filesystem.\n\n- CVE-2022-36113: Cargo is a package manager for the rust programming language. After a package is downloaded, Cargo extracts its source code in the ~/.cargo folder on disk, making it available to the Rust projects it builds. To record when an extraction is successful, Cargo writes \"ok\" to the .cargo-ok file at the root of the extracted source code once it extracted all the files. It was discovered that Cargo allowed packages to contain a .cargo-ok symbolic link, which Cargo would extract. Then, when Cargo attempted to write \"ok\" into .cargo-ok, it would actually replace the first two bytes of the file the symlink pointed to with ok. This would allow an attacker to corrupt one file on the machine using Cargo to extract the package. Note that by design Cargo allows code execution at build time, due to build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerabilities in this advisory allow performing a subset of the possible damage in a harder to track down way. Your dependencies must still be trusted if you want to be protected from attacks, as it's possible to perform the same attacks with build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerability is present in all versions of Cargo. Rust 1.64, to be released on September 22nd, will include a fix for it. Since the vulnerability is just a more limited way to accomplish what a malicious build scripts or procedural macros can do, we decided not to publish Rust point releases backporting the security fix. Patch files are available for Rust 1.63.0 are available in the wg-security-response repository for people building their own toolchain. Mitigations We recommend users of alternate registries to exercise care in which package they download, by only including trusted dependencies in their projects. Please note that even with these vulnerabilities fixed, by design Cargo allows arbitrary code execution at build time thanks to build scripts and procedural macros: a malicious dependency will be able to cause damage regardless of these vulnerabilities. crates.io implemented server-side checks to reject these kinds of packages years ago, and there are no packages on crates.io exploiting these vulnerabilities. crates.io users still need to exercise care in choosing their dependencies though, as remote code execution is allowed by design there as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24904: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with version 0.7.0 and prior to versions 2.1.15m 2.2.9, and 2.3.4 is vulnerable to a symlink following bug allowing a malicious user with repository write access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user with write access for a repository which is (or may be) used in a directory-type Application may commit a symlink which points to an out-of-bounds file.

Depending on the context, a code sequence may be in the form of a function call, a small number of instructions, a series of program invocations, etc.\n\n\nA race condition violates these properties, which are closely related:\n\n\n  - Exclusivity - the code sequence is given exclusive access to the shared resource, i.e., no other code sequence can modify properties of the shared resource before the original sequence has completed execution.\n\n  - Atomicity - the code sequence is behaviorally atomic, i.e., no other thread or process can concurrently execute the same sequence of instructions (or a subset) against the same resource.\n\nA race condition exists when an \"interfering code sequence\" can still access the shared resource, violating exclusivity.\n\nThe interfering code sequence could be \"trusted\" or \"untrusted.\" A trusted interfering code sequence occurs within the product; it cannot be modified by the attacker, and it can only be invoked indirectly. An untrusted interfering code sequence can be authored directly by the attacker, and typically it is external to the vulnerable product.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-29527: Go application for cloud management creates a world-writable sudoers file that allows local attackers to inject sudo rules and escalate privileges to root by winning a race condition.\n\n- CVE-2021-1782: Chain: improper locking (CWE-667) leads to race condition (CWE-362), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2021-0920: Chain: mobile platform race condition (CWE-362) leading to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-6819: Chain: race condition (CWE-362) leads to use-after-free (CWE-416), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2019-18827: chain: JTAG interface is not disabled (CWE-1191) during ROM code execution, introducing a race condition (CWE-362) to extract encryption keys\n\n- CVE-2019-1161: Chain: race condition (CWE-362) in anti-malware product allows deletion of files by creating a junction (CWE-1386) and using hard links during the time window in which a temporary file is created and deleted.\n\n- CVE-2015-1743: TOCTOU in sandbox process allows installation of untrusted browser add-ons by replacing a file after it has been verified, but before it is executed\n\n- CVE-2014-8273: Chain: chipset has a race condition (CWE-362) between when an interrupt handler detects an attempt to write-enable the BIOS (in violation of the lock bit), and when the handler resets the write-enable bit back to 0, allowing attackers to issue BIOS writes during the timing window [REF-1237].\n\n- CVE-2008-5044: Race condition leading to a crash by calling a hook removal procedure while other activities are occurring at the same time.\n\n- CVE-2008-2958: chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.\n\n- CVE-2008-1570: chain: time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in program allows bypass of protection mechanism that was designed to prevent symlink attacks.\n\n- CVE-2008-0058: Unsynchronized caching operation enables a race condition that causes messages to be sent to a deallocated object.\n\n- CVE-2008-0379: Race condition during initialization triggers a buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2007-6599: Daemon crash by quickly performing operations and undoing them, which eventually leads to an operation that does not acquire a lock.\n\n- CVE-2007-6180: chain: race condition triggers NULL pointer dereference\n\n- CVE-2007-5794: Race condition in library function could cause data to be sent to the wrong process.\n\n- CVE-2007-3970: Race condition in file parser leads to heap corruption.\n\n- CVE-2008-5021: chain: race condition allows attacker to access an object while it is still being initialized, causing software to access uninitialized memory.\n\n- CVE-2009-4895: chain: race condition for an argument value, possibly resulting in NULL dereference\n\n- CVE-2009-3547: chain: race condition might allow resource to be released before operating on it, leading to NULL dereference\n\n- CVE-2006-5051: Chain: Signal handler contains too much functionality (CWE-828), introducing a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a double free (CWE-415).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-6388: Out of bounds access in WebAudio in Google Chrome prior to 80.0.3987.87 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-0366: In vpu, there is a possible memory corruption due to a race condition.

The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, get de-allocated when a guest switched (back) from v2 to v1. The freeing of such pages requires that the hypervisor know where in the guest these pages were mapped. The hypervisor tracks only one use within guest space, but racing requests from the guest to insert mappings of these pages may result in any of them to become mapped in multiple locations. Upon switching back from v2 to v1, the guest would then retain access to a page that was freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes.\n\n- CVE-2021-28701: Another race in XENMAPSPACE_grant_table handling Guests are permitted access to certain Xen-owned pages of memory. The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, are de-allocated when a guest switches (back) from v2 to v1. Freeing such pages requires that the hypervisor enforce that no parallel request can result in the addition of a mapping of such a page to a guest. That enforcement was missing, allowing guests to retain access to pages that were freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes. Unfortunately, when XSA-379 was being prepared, this similar issue was not noticed.\n\n- CVE-2020-11492: An issue was discovered in Docker Desktop through 2.2.0.5 on Windows.

If this is not the case, they assume that a following removal of the granted access will always succeed, which is not true in case the backend has mapped the granted page between those two operations. As a result the backend can keep access to the memory page of the guest no matter how the page will be used after the frontend I/O has finished. The xenbus driver has a similar problem, as it doesn't check the success of removing the granted access of a shared ring buffer. blkfront: CVE-2022-23036 netfront: CVE-2022-23037 scsifront: CVE-2022-23038 gntalloc: CVE-2022-23039 xenbus: CVE-2022-23040 blkfront, netfront, scsifront, usbfront, dmabuf, xenbus, 9p, kbdfront, and pvcalls are using a functionality to delay freeing a grant reference until it is no longer in use, but the freeing of the related data page is not synchronized with dropping the granted access. As a result the backend can keep access to the memory page even after it has been freed and then re-used for a different purpose.

When a BGP flow route with redirect IP extended community is received, and the reachability to the next-hop of the corresponding redirect IP is flapping, the rpd process might crash. Whether the crash occurs depends on the timing of the internally processing of these two events and is outside the attackers control. Please note that this issue also affects Route-Reflectors unless 'routing-options flow firewall-install-disable' is configured.

In affected versions the implementation for `tf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesCreateEnsemble` can result in a use after free error if an attacker supplies specially crafted arguments. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f24faa153ad31a4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/boosted_trees/resource_ops.cc#L55) uses a reference counted resource and decrements the refcount if the initialization fails, as it should. However, when the code was written, the resource was represented as a naked pointer but later refactoring has changed it to be a smart pointer. Thus, when the pointer leaves the scope, a subsequent `free`-ing of the resource occurs, but this fails to take into account that the refcount has already reached 0, thus the resource has been already freed. During this double-free process, members of the resource object are accessed for cleanup but they are invalid as the entire resource has been freed. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 5ecec9c6fbdbc6be03295685190a45e7eee726ab. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0.

The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNorm` is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. If the tensors are empty, the same implementation can trigger undefined behavior by dereferencing null pointers. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/57d86e0db5d1365f19adcce848dfc1bf89fdd4c7/tensorflow/core/kernels/fused_batch_norm_op.cc) fails to validate that `scale`, `offset`, `mean` and `variance` (the last two only when required) all have the same number of elements as the number of channels of `x`. This results in heap out of bounds reads when the buffers backing these tensors are indexed past their boundary. If the tensors are empty, the validation mentioned in the above paragraph would also trigger and prevent the undefined behavior. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29988: Firefox incorrectly treated an inline list-item element as a block element, resulting in an out of bounds read or memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

The function ezxml_parse_str() performs incorrect memory handling while parsing crafted XML files (out-of-bounds read after a certain strcspn failure).\n\n- CVE-2021-32761: Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. A vulnerability involving out-of-bounds read and integer overflow to buffer overflow exists starting with version 2.2 and prior to versions 5.0.13, 6.0.15, and 6.2.5. On 32-bit systems, Redis `*BIT*` command are vulnerable to integer overflow that can potentially be exploited to corrupt the heap, leak arbitrary heap contents or trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter to a very large value and constructing specially crafted commands bit commands. This problem only affects Redis on 32-bit platforms, or compiled as a 32-bit binary. Redis versions 5.0.`3m 6.0.15, and 6.2.5 contain patches for this issue. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the `redis-server` executable is to prevent users from modifying the `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.\n\n- CVE-2021-3409: The patch for CVE-2020-17380/CVE-2020-25085 was found to be ineffective, thus making QEMU vulnerable to the out-of-bounds read/write access issues previously found in the SDHCI controller emulation code. This flaw allows a malicious privileged guest to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service or potential code execution. QEMU up to (including) 5.2.0 is affected by this.\n\n- CVE-2021-3517: There is a flaw in the xml entity encoding functionality of libxml2 in versions before 2.9.11. An attacker who is able to supply a crafted file to be processed by an application linked with the affected functionality of libxml2 could trigger an out-of-bounds read. The most likely impact of this flaw is to application availability, with some potential impact to confidentiality and integrity if an attacker is able to use memory information to further exploit the application.\n\n- CVE-2021-3712: ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2y).\n\n- CVE-2021-31174: Microsoft Excel Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-27408: The affected product is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read, which can cause information leakage leading to arbitrary code execution if chained to the out-of-bounds write vulnerability on the Welch Allyn medical device management tools (Welch Allyn Service Tool: versions prior to v1.10, Welch Allyn Connex Device Integration Suite \u2013 Network Connectivity Engine (NCE): versions prior to v5.3, Welch Allyn Software Development Kit (SDK): versions prior to v3.2, Welch Allyn Connex Central Station (CS): versions prior to v1.8.6, Welch Allyn Service Monitor: versions prior to v1.7.0.0, Welch Allyn Connex Vital Signs Monitor (CVSM): versions prior to v2.43.02, Welch Allyn Connex Integrated Wall System (CIWS): versions prior to v2.43.02, Welch Allyn Connex Spot Monitor (CSM): versions prior to v1.52, Welch Allyn Spot Vital Signs 4400 Device (Spot 4400) / Welch Allyn Spot 4400 Vital Signs Extended Care Device: versions prior to v1.11.00).\n\n- CVE-2021-27791: The function that is used to parse the Authentication header in Brocade Fabric OS Web application service before Brocade Fabric OS v9.0.1a and v8.2.3a fails to properly process a malformed authentication header from the client, resulting in reading memory addresses outside the intended range.

If that file endsin a line with 4095 consecutive non-white space letters and no newline, curlwould first read past the end of the stack-based buffer, and if the readworks, write a zero byte beyond its boundary.This will in most cases cause a segfault or similar, but circumstances might also cause different outcomes.If a malicious user can provide a custom netrc file to an application or otherwise affect its contents, this flaw could be used as denial-of-service.\n\n- CVE-2022-39392: Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to version 2.0.2, there is a bug in Wasmtime's implementation of its pooling instance allocator when the allocator is configured to give WebAssembly instances a maximum of zero pages of memory. In this configuration, the virtual memory mapping for WebAssembly memories did not meet the compiler-required configuration requirements for safely executing WebAssembly modules. Wasmtime's default settings require virtual memory page faults to indicate that wasm reads/writes are out-of-bounds, but the pooling allocator's configuration would not create an appropriate virtual memory mapping for this meaning out of bounds reads/writes can successfully read/write memory unrelated to the wasm sandbox within range of the base address of the memory mapping created by the pooling allocator. This bug is not applicable with the default settings of the `wasmtime` crate. This bug can only be triggered by setting `InstanceLimits::memory_pages` to zero. This is expected to be a very rare configuration since this means that wasm modules cannot allocate any pages of linear memory. All wasm modules produced by all current toolchains are highly likely to use linear memory, so it's expected to be unlikely that this configuration is set to zero by any production embedding of Wasmtime. This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2. This bug can be worked around by increasing the `memory_pages` allotment when configuring the pooling allocator to a value greater than zero. If an embedding wishes to still prevent memory from actually being used then the `Store::limiter` method can be used to dynamically disallow growth of memory beyond 0 bytes large. Note that the default `memory_pages` value is greater than zero.\n\n- CVE-2022-41902: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The function MakeGrapplerFunctionItem takes arguments that determine the sizes of inputs and outputs. If the inputs given are greater than or equal to the sizes of the outputs, an out-of-bounds memory read or a crash is triggered. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit a65411a1d69edfb16b25907ffb8f73556ce36bb7. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.8.4, 2.9.3, and 2.10.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-41981: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the TGA file format parser of OpenImageIO v2.3.19.0. A specially-crafted targa file can lead to out of bounds read and write on the process stack, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-4203: A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. In theory it could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext) although we are not aware of any working exploit leading to memory contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects. \n\n- CVE-2022-48303: GNU Tar through 1.34 has a one-byte out-of-bounds read that results in use of uninitialized memory for a conditional jump. Exploitation to change the flow of control has not been demonstrated.

The greatest risk from this flaw is to application availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-1441: MP4Box is a component of GPAC-2.0.0, which is a widely-used third-party package on RPM Fusion. When MP4Box tries to parse a MP4 file, it calls the function `diST_box_read()` to read from video. In this function, it allocates a buffer `str` with fixed length. However, content read from `bs` is controllable by user, so is the length, which causes a buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2022-3435: A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in Linux Kernel.

If the resulting values are used in a sensitive context, then dangerous behaviors may occur.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-2639: Chain: integer coercion error (CWE-192) prevents a return value from indicating an error, leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)\n\n- CVE-2021-43537: Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n\n- CVE-2007-4268: Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)\n\n- CVE-2007-4988: Chain: signed short width value in image processor is sign extended during conversion to unsigned int, which leads to integer overflow and heap-based buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2009-0231: Integer truncation of length value leads to heap-based buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2008-3282: Size of a particular type changes for 64-bit platforms, leading to an integer truncation in document processor causes incorrect index to be generated.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-23997: Due to unexpected data type conversions, a use-after-free could have occurred when interacting with the font cache.

In affected versions the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad` is vulnerable to an integer overflow issue caused by converting a signed integer value to an unsigned one and then allocating memory based on this value. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.cc#L126) uses the `axis` value as the size argument to `absl::InlinedVector` constructor. But, the constructor uses an unsigned type for the argument, so the implicit conversion transforms the negative value to a large integer. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 96f364a1ca3009f98980021c4b32be5fdcca33a1. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, and TensorFlow 2.4.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-37646: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams` is vulnerable to an integer overflow issue caused by converting a signed integer value to an unsigned one and then allocating memory based on this value.

The `reserve` method calls `TF_TString_Reserve` which has an `unsigned long` argument for the size of the buffer. Hence, the implicit conversion transforms the negative value to a large integer. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit c283e542a3f422420cfdb332414543b62fc4e4a5. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0.

In versions prior to 1.3.0 there exists a DoS vulnerability that is possible due to a bug in the library that would allow an attacker with specifically designed queries to cause stack overflow panics. Any user with access to the GraphQL handler can send these queries and cause stack overflows. This in turn could potentially compromise the ability of the server to serve data to its users. The issue has been patched in version `v1.3.0`. The only known workaround for this issue is to disable the `graphql.MaxDepth` option from your schema which is not recommended.\n\n- CVE-2022-23591: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The `GraphDef` format in TensorFlow does not allow self recursive functions. The runtime assumes that this invariant is satisfied. However, a `GraphDef` containing a fragment such as the following can be consumed when loading a `SavedModel`. This would result in a stack overflow during execution as resolving each `NodeDef` means resolving the function itself and its nodes. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-24675: encoding/pem in Go before 1.17.9 and 1.18.x before 1.18.1 has a Decode stack overflow via a large amount of PEM data.\n\n- CVE-2022-31019: Vapor is a server-side Swift HTTP web framework. When using automatic content decoding an attacker can craft a request body that can make the server crash with the following request: `curl -d \"array[_0][0][array][_0][0][array]$(for f in $(seq 1100); do echo -n '[_0][0][array]'; done)[string][_0]=hello%20world\" http://localhost:8080/foo`. The issue is unbounded, attacker controlled stack growth which will at some point lead to a stack overflow and a process crash. This issue has been fixed in version 4.61.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-31099: rulex is a new, portable, regular expression language. When parsing untrusted rulex expressions, the stack may overflow, possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when parsing an expression with several hundred levels of nesting, causing the process to abort immediately. This is a security concern for you, if your service parses untrusted rulex expressions (expressions provided by an untrusted user), and your service becomes unavailable when the process running rulex aborts due to a stack overflow. The crash is fixed in version **0.4.3**. Affected users are advised to update to this version. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-3216: A vulnerability has been found in Nintendo Game Boy Color and classified as problematic. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the component Mobile Adapter GB. The manipulation leads to memory corruption. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. VDB-208606 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-38334: XPDF v4.04 and earlier was discovered to contain a stack overflow via the function Catalog::countPageTree() at Catalog.cc.\n\n- CVE-2022-41966: XStream serializes Java objects to XML and back again. Versions prior to 1.4.20 may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error, resulting in a denial of service only via manipulation the processed input stream. The attack uses the hash code implementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash calculation causing a stack overflow. This issue is patched in version 1.4.20 which handles the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead. A potential workaround for users who only use HashMap or HashSet and whose XML refers these only as default map or set, is to change the default implementation of java.util.Map and java.util per the code example in the referenced advisory. However, this implies that your application does not care about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.\n\n- CVE-2022-47662: GPAC MP4Box 2.1-DEV-rev649-ga8f438d20 has a segment fault (/stack overflow) due to infinite recursion in Media_GetSample isomedia/media.c:662\n\n- CVE-2022-23460: Jsonxx or Json++ is a JSON parser, writer and reader written in C++. In affected versions of jsonxx json parsing may lead to stack exhaustion in an address sanitized (ASAN) build. This issue may lead to Denial of Service if the program using the jsonxx library crashes. This issue exists on the current commit of the jsonxx project and the project itself has been archived. Updates are not expected. Users are advised to find a replacement.\n\n- CVE-2022-23606: Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications. When a cluster is deleted via Cluster Discovery Service (CDS) all idle connections established to endpoints in that cluster are disconnected. A recursion was introduced in the procedure of disconnecting idle connections that can lead to stack exhaustion and abnormal process termination when a cluster has a large number of idle connections. This infinite recursion causes Envoy to crash. Users are advised to upgrade.\n\n- CVE-2022-24921: regexp.Compile in Go before 1.16.15 and 1.17.x before 1.17.8 allows stack exhaustion via a deeply nested expression.\n\n- CVE-2022-25313: In Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.5, an attacker can trigger stack exhaustion in build_model via a large nesting depth in the DTD element.\n\n- CVE-2022-27810: It was possible to trigger an infinite recursion condition in the error handler when Hermes executed specific maliciously formed JavaScript. This condition was only possible to trigger in dev-mode (when asserts were enabled). This issue affects Hermes versions prior to v0.12.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-28201: An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.35.6, 1.36.x before 1.36.4, and 1.37.x before 1.37.2. Users with the editinterface permission can trigger infinite recursion, because a bare local interwiki is mishandled for the mainpage message.\n\n- CVE-2022-28773: Due to an uncontrolled recursion in SAP Web Dispatcher and SAP Internet Communication Manager, the application may crash, leading to denial of service, but can be restarted automatically. \n\n- CVE-2022-31173: Juniper is a GraphQL server library for Rust. Affected versions of Juniper are vulnerable to uncontrolled recursion resulting in a program crash. This issue has been addressed in version 0.15.10. Users are advised to upgrade.
