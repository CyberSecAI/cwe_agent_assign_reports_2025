# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-41080
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved io_uring fix possible deadlock in io_register_iowq_max_workers() The io_register_iowq_max_workers() function calls io_put_sq_data(), which acquires the sqd->lock without releasing the uring_lock. Similar to the commit 009ad9f0c6ee (io_uring drop ctx->uring_lock before acquiring sqd->lock), this can lead to a potential deadlock situation. To resolve this issue, the uring_lock is released before calling io_put_sq_data(), and then it is re-acquired after the function call. This change ensures that the locks are acquired in the correct order, preventing the possibility of a deadlock.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'improper lock order'
