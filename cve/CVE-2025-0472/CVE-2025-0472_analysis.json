While it's generally discouraged to map to Class-level CWEs, in this case, it accurately reflects the high-level nature of the vulnerability, which is the exposure of sensitive information. Other CWEs considered were more specific types of information exposure (e.g., CWE-532, CWE-209), but the provided description doesn't give enough information to definitively narrow it down to one of those. CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere) was also considered, but CWE-200 is more directly related to the described impact.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe668[\"CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\"]\n    cwe532[\"CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\"]\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe532 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe209 -->|CHILDOF| cwe668\n    cwe200 -->|PEEROF| cwe668\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe668,cwe532,cwe209 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **weakness**, which is **information exposure**, due to an unspecified **root cause** that leads to an attacker being able to upload a file and enumerate internal files. This enumeration of internal files is the impact of the **information exposure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the provided CVE reference summary.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to upload a file to the environment and enumerate the internal files of a machine by looking at the request response.\" The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** explicitly states: \"**CVE-2025-0472**: Information exposure in the PMB platform.\" And it confirms that \"**CVE-2025-0472**: Allows an attacker to upload a file to the environment and enumerate the internal files of a machine by looking at the request response.\".\n\nCWE-200 aligns with the description of \"**Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**.\" The other candidate CWEs from the retriever results, such as CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) and CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information), are more specific and there is no evidence to support those in the description.
