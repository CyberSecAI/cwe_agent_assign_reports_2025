The secondary CWE, CWE-212, relates to the failure to remove sensitive data before storage or transfer, potentially leading to the exposure. Both CWEs are at the Base level, providing a specific representation of the weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe359[\"CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe359 primary\n    class cwe212 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves the following steps:\n1.  Deleted apps leave call history data.\n2.  The data is not properly removed or secured. (**ROOT CAUSE**: CWE-212)\n3.  The call history appears in Spotlight search results.\n4.  Private personal information is exposed to an unauthorized actor. (**IMPACT**: CWE-359)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting impact of the vulnerability. The key evidence is that \"Call history from deleted apps may still appear in spotlight search results,\" leading to a \"privacy issue\".\n\nThe Retriever Results and Complete CWE Specifications were then reviewed to determine the best CWE mappings. CWE-359, \"Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\", was selected as the primary CWE because it directly describes the impact of the vulnerability. CWE-212, \"Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\" was selected as a secondary CWE because the exposure was due to failure to remove the data after deletion of the app.\n\nThis assessment is primarily based on the provided evidence, specifically the **weakness** that call history from deleted apps remains accessible, leading to a privacy issue. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, providing a clear representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-459: Incomplete Cleanup\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly \"clean up\" and remove temporary or supporting resources after they have been used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
