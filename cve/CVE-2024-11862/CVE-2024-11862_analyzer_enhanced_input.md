## Vulnerability Description
**Non constant time cryptographic operation** in Devolutions.XTS.NET 2024.11.19 and earlier allows an attacker to render half of the encryption key obsolete via a timing attacks

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Non constant time cryptographic operation**
- **impact:** render half of the encryption key obsolete
- **vector:** timing attacks
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Devolutions.XTS.NET
- **version:** 2024.11.19 and earlier

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Timing attacks on Galois Field multiplications within the `Devolutions.XTS.NET` package.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Vulnerable to timing attacks during Galois Field multiplications.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation effectively reduces the security of XTS mode to that of ECB mode, allowing block swapping, identification of identical blocks, and rendering half of the XTS key obsolete.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must have local access to the system where the vulnerable code is running but requires no special privileges. There is no user interaction requirement.
