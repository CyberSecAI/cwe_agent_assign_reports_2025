While several other CWEs were considered, including those related to improper neutralization, none directly addressed the root cause of **information disclosure** as effectively as CWE-497. The abstraction level of Base for CWE-497 is appropriate as it represents the fundamental weakness.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe497 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the product's **failure to prevent access to sensitive information**, leading directly to **information disclosure**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which indicates that the manipulation of `/install_base.data` leads to **information disclosure**. The most relevant CWE is CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere), as it directly addresses the root cause of **information disclosure**. While other CWEs like those related to injection or authentication bypass were considered, they didn't align as directly with the core issue of exposing sensitive information without proper authorization.\n\nThe evidence is the description of the vulnerability that states \"The manipulation leads to **information disclosure**\".\n\nThe chosen CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the **exposure of sensitive system information**, which aligns with the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
