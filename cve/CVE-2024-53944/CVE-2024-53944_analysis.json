A unauthenticated remote attacker with network access can exploit a **command injection** vulnerability. The /goform/formJsonAjaxReq endpoint fails to sanitize shell metacharacters sent via JSON parameters, thus allowing attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges.",

The impact is that attackers can execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges.\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is: \"A unauthenticated remote attacker with network access can exploit a **command injection** vulnerability.
