# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-23814

# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-23814
## Query
The integrated ICMP service of the network stack of affected devices can be forced to exhaust its available memory resources when receiving specially crafted messages targeting IP fragment re-assembly. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a temporary denial of service condition of the ICMP service, other communication services are not affected. Affected devices will resume normal operation after the attack terminates.
