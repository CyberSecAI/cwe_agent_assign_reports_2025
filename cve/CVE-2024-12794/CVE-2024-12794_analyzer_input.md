## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12794 (PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval)
*   **Affected Product:** E-commerce Site Using PHP With Source Code V1.0
*   **Vulnerable File:** `/admin/editorder.php`
*   **Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection
*   **Root Cause:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because the `dstatus` parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `dstatus` parameter.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is accessible via an HTTP POST request to `/admin/editorder.php`. No login or authorization is required to exploit it.
*  **Vulnerable Parameter:** `dstatus`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
*   **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.
*   **System Control:** Attackers can potentially gain comprehensive control over the system.
*   **Service Interruption:** Exploitation could lead to service disruption.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `/admin/editorder.php` endpoint.
*   No authentication is required.
* The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious SQL code through the `dstatus` parameter.

**Proof of Concept (PoC):**

*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `dstatus`
*   **Payload:** `order=11&dstatus=111' AND IF((SELECT DATABASE() = 'ebuybd'), SLEEP(3), '0') WHERE id=1  --+dwada`
*   The provided screenshot shows the HTTP request using the above payload that successfully extracts database information using a time-based blind SQL injection.

**Suggested Fixes:**

1.  **Prepared Statements and Parameter Binding:** Use prepared statements to separate SQL code from user input, treating user-supplied values as data rather than executable code.
2.  **Input Validation and Filtering:** Implement strict validation and filtering on user input, ensuring it conforms to the expected format and preventing malicious SQL code injection.
3.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content offers a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, the specific vulnerable file, and a working PoC.
*   The content also specifies that no login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability, increasing its severity.
*   The provided fixes are industry-standard best practices for preventing SQL injection.
