CWE-614 is a more specific variant of CWE-319, as it focuses on the specific case of sensitive cookies lacking the Secure attribute. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions this scenario, making CWE-614 the more appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe614[\"CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    \n    cwe614 -->|CHILDOF| cwe319\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe614 primary\n    class cwe319 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **failure to set the Secure attribute for a sensitive cookie (root cause)**, leading to the potential for the cookie to be transmitted in cleartext over an HTTP session (impact).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed towards CWE-614 due to the explicit mention of the missing Secure attribute for sensitive cookies. The retriever results also ranked CWE-614 as the top candidate. The relationship analysis confirmed that CWE-614 is a more specific variant of CWE-319, making it a better fit for the vulnerability description.\n\nThe primary basis for this assessment is the vulnerability description itself: \"RELY-PCIe v22.2.1 to v23.1.0 **does not set the Secure attribute for sensitive cookies** in HTTPS sessions, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in cleartext over an HTTP session.\" This statement directly aligns with the definition of CWE-614.\n\nThe selection of CWE-614 is at the optimal level of specificity because it precisely describes the vulnerability: a sensitive cookie transmitted over HTTPS without the Secure attribute. This is more specific than the general case of cleartext transmission.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions is not set, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\nCWE-614 is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly states that the \"Secure\" attribute for sensitive cookies is not set. This directly matches the description of CWE-614: \"The Secure attribute for sensitive cookies in HTTPS sessions is not set, which could cause the user agent to send those cookies in plaintext over an HTTP session.\" The \"Usage: Allowed\" mapping guidance further supports this selection. The confidence level is high (1.0) because of the clear and direct match between the vulnerability description and the CWE definition.\n\nCWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is considered as a secondary CWE because the ultimate impact of **not setting the Secure attribute** is the potential for transmitting sensitive information in cleartext. While CWE-614 is more specific to the root cause, CWE-319 describes the resulting vulnerability. The confidence level is 0.7 because it represents the potential impact rather than the direct cause.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-1004 (Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag): While related to cookies, the vulnerability description does not mention the HttpOnly flag, so it's not applicable.\n*   CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information): This CWE is not relevant as the issue is with transmission, not storage.\n*   CWE-1275 (Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute): The vulnerability description does not mention the SameSite attribute.\n*   CWE-565 and CWE-784 (Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking): These are not applicable as the core issue is not the reliance on the cookie itself, but the missing Secure attribute.\n*   CWE-807 and CWE-472 (Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision and External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter): These are not applicable as the vulnerability doesn't involve untrusted inputs or external control of parameters.\n*   CWE-201 and CWE-212 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data and Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer): These are not applicable as the vulnerability doesn't involve insertion or removal of sensitive information.",

There is a chance that future research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine if other weaknesses allow CSRF attacks to occur, and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable CSRF tokens might allow bypass of CSRF protection mechanisms; if this occurs, they might be better characterized as randomness/predictability weaknesses.",
