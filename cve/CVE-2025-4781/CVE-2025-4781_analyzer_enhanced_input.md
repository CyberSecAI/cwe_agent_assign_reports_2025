## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```json
{
  "CVE": "CVE-2025-4781",
  "Content": "During the security assessment of \"Park Ticketing Management System\", I detected a critical SQL injection vulnerability in the \"/forgot-password.php\" file. This vulnerability is attributed to the insufficient validation of user input for the \"email\" parameter. This inadequacy enables attackers to inject malicious SQL queries. Consequently, attackers can access the database without proper authorization, modify or delete data, and obtain sensitive information. Immediate corrective actions are essential to safeguard system security and uphold data integrity.\n\n*   **Vulnerability location:** \"email\" parameter\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause lies in the fact that attackers can inject malicious code via the parameter \"email\". This input is then directly utilized in SQL queries without undergoing proper sanitization or validation processes.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Exploiting this SQL injection vulnerability allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to the database, cause sensitive data leakage, tamper with data, gain complete control over the system, and even disrupt services. This poses a severe threat to both the security of the system and the continuity of business operations.\n*   **Attack vectors:** Attackers can inject malicious code via the parameter \"email\".\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers can access the database without proper authorization, modify or delete data, and obtain sensitive information.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:**\n    1.  Employ prepared statements and parameter binding\n    2.  Conduct input validation and filtering\n    3.  Minimize database user permissions",
