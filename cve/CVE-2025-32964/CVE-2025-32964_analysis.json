  "description": "ManageWiki is a MediaWiki extension allowing users to manage wikis. Prior to commit 00bebea, when enabling a conflicting extension, a restricted extension would be automatically disabled even if the user did not hold the ManageWiki-restricted right. This issue has been patched in commit 00bebea. A workaround involves ensuring that any extensions requiring specific permissions in `$wgManageWikiExtensions` also require the same permissions for managing any conflicting extensions.",

A restricted extension would be automatically disabled even if the user did not have the necessary \"ManageWiki-restricted right\".\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **CWE-285:** Improper Privilege Management. Specifically, insufficient privilege checks when disabling extensions.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   A user without the required permissions can bypass restrictions and disable extensions that they should not be able to.\n*   Integrity: Low - unauthorized modification of extension status.\n*   Availability: Low - potential disruption of functionality if a critical extension is disabled.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network.\n*   **Requires User Interaction:** An attacker needs a user to initiate the extension enabling process.\n*   **Low Privileges Required:** An attacker needs low privileges to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be a user with limited privileges who can trigger the extension enabling process.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Upgrade to version 00bebea or later.** This commit addresses the vulnerability.\n*   **Workaround:** Ensure that any extensions requiring specific permissions in `$wgManageWikiExtensions` also require the same permissions for managing any conflicting extensions.\n\n**CVSS Score:** 4.6 (Moderate)\n\n*   CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L",

The vulnerability involves an authorization check that is incorrectly performed, which aligns with CWE-863's definition. Additionally, CWE-266 was considered due to the involvement of privilege assignment, but the evidence suggests that the core issue is with the authorization logic itself rather than the initial assignment of privileges.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n\n    cwe942[\"CWE-942: Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains\"]\n\n    cwe942 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe266 -->|PEEROF| cwe863\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe266 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect authorization** (**CWE-863**) during the extension enabling process. This leads to a bypass of intended restrictions, ultimately resulting in a restricted extension being disabled without the necessary permissions. In this case **CWE-863** is the first in the chain.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The key phrase \"automatically disabled restricted extension even if user did not hold the ManageWiki-restricted right\" strongly suggests an authorization issue. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating \"insufficient privilege checks when disabling extensions\".\n\nThe Retriever Results highlighted CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as a potential candidate. While it is a Class-level CWE, the provided context strongly supports its selection as the primary weakness.\n\nThe choice of CWE-863 is justified because the vulnerability lies in the incorrect implementation of the authorization check, allowing a user without the 'ManageWiki-restricted' right to disable extensions.\n\nCWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) was considered as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability involves a privilege bypass. However, the primary issue is not about assigning incorrect privileges, but rather about failing to properly authorize the action of disabling the extension.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause and contributing factors of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
