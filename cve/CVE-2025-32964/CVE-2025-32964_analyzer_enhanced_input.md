## Vulnerability Description
ManageWiki is a MediaWiki extension allowing users to manage wikis. Prior to commit 00bebea, when enabling a conflicting extension, a restricted extension would be automatically disabled even if the user did not hold the ManageWiki-restricted right. This issue has been patched in commit 00bebea. A workaround involves ensuring that any extensions requiring specific permissions in `$wgManageWikiExtensions` also require the same permissions for managing any conflicting extensions.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **automatically disabled restricted extension even if user did not hold the ManageWiki-restricted right**
- **impact:** disable conflicting extension
- **vector:** enabling a conflicting extension
- **product:** ManageWiki MediaWiki extension
- **version:** prior to commit 00bebea

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-32964 based on provided content:

This content is directly related to CVE-2025-32964 and provides significantly more detail than the placeholder description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

A permission bypass vulnerability exists when enabling a conflicting extension. A restricted extension would be automatically disabled even if the user did not have the necessary "ManageWiki-restricted right".

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-285:** Improper Privilege Management. Specifically, insufficient privilege checks when disabling extensions.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   A user without the required permissions can bypass restrictions and disable extensions that they should not be able to.
*   Integrity: Low - unauthorized modification of extension status.
*   Availability: Low - potential disruption of functionality if a critical extension is disabled.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network.
*   **Requires User Interaction:** An attacker needs a user to initiate the extension enabling process.
*   **Low Privileges Required:** An attacker needs low privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be a user with limited privileges who can trigger the extension enabling process.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Upgrade to version 00bebea or later.** This commit addresses the vulnerability.
*   **Workaround:** Ensure that any extensions requiring specific permissions in `$wgManageWikiExtensions` also require the same permissions for managing any conflicting extensions.

**CVSS Score:** 4.6 (Moderate)

*   CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set ‚Äì Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* üîç *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* üîç *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion ‚Äì CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### üî∏ CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúA user created with the ‚Äòguest‚Äô role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúThe backup service runs as root but only needs read access.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### üî∏ CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúUser can access another user‚Äôs invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.‚Äù*

## Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *‚ÄúUser can escalate privileges to admin.‚Äù*
> ‚ùå Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged ‚Äì only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ‚úÖ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

* ‚úÖ **CWE-266**: *‚ÄúWhen a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.‚Äù*
* ‚úÖ **CWE-250**: *‚ÄúInstaller runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.‚Äù*
* ‚úÖ **CWE-284**: *‚ÄúInconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.‚Äù*
