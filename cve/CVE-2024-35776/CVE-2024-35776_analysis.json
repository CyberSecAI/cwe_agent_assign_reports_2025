The vulnerability description key phrases also support this, noting \"Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor.\"\n\nCWE-200, while discouraged by MITRE for being too general, is the most applicable CWE given the information available. The evidence clearly points to the exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized actors due to **lack of access controls**. Alternative CWEs considered include those related to path traversal or file upload restrictions, but these do not accurately reflect the core weakness in this case.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because the root cause is directly related to the exposure itself, rather than a more specific underlying cause like improper input validation or resource management.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected*: While relevant, this is more specific than the general exposure, and requires the information to be in a file/directory.
