The vulnerability description and CVE summary explicitly state the presence of **embedded credentials**, a form of **hard-coded credentials**. |\n| CWE-259 | Use of Hard-coded Password | 0.8 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary candidate. While the vulnerability description mentions retrieving the SSH hash string, it is reasonable to assume that this involves a hard-coded password. |\n| CWE-497 | Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. Retrieving the SSH hash string leads to the exposure of sensitive system information. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship is that CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) is a Variant of CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials). While CWE-259 is more specific, the provided description does not explicitly state that the **embedded credentials** are a password. Therefore, CWE-798 is a more appropriate primary classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    \n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe497 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe798\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe798 primary\n    class cwe259,cwe497 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **hard-coded credentials** (CWE-798). A local user can then retrieve the SSH hash string (CWE-497), potentially leading to compromise of SSH access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions an \"**embedded credentials vulnerability**\". The CVE reference links confirm that the **root cause** is **hardcoded/embedded credentials** (CWE-798).\n\nCWE-798 is chosen because it directly addresses the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the presence of **hard-coded credentials**. The vulnerability description and CVE summary provide sufficient evidence.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password): While highly relevant, the description does not explicitly state that a password is the credential in question.\n*   CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere): This is a potential impact of the vulnerability, not the **root cause**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity based on the provided evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains **hard-coded credentials**, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the **root causes** of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:\n\n```\n\t\tInbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.\n\t\tOutbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.\n```\nIn the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.\n\nThe Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.\n",
