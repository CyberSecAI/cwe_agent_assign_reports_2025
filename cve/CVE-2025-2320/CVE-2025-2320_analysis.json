  "description": "A vulnerability has been found in 274056675 springboot-openai-chatgpt e84f6f5 and classified as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is the function submit of the file /api/blade-user/submit of the component User Handler. The manipulation leads to **improper authorization**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This product takes the approach of rolling releases to provide continious delivery. Therefore, version details for affected and updated releases are not available. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

It describes how ordinary users can create new administrator accounts due to missing permission checks.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nMissing permission checks in the `api/blade-user/submit` endpoint.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Privilege escalation\n*   Missing authorization\n*   Insecure direct object reference (potentially, as users can create arbitrary administrator accounts)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Data leakage\n*   Account takeover\n*   Unauthorized access to administrative functions\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An authenticated (even ordinary) user can directly invoke the `api/blade-user/submit` method.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An authenticated user account (even with limited privileges).\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not explicitly state a fix, but implies that implementing proper permission checks on the `api/blade-user/submit` endpoint is necessary to prevent unauthorized account creation.\n\n**More detail than official CVE description:**\n\nYes, the content provides significantly more detail than a placeholder CVE description. It includes the specific endpoint vulnerable, a description of the PoC, and the potential impact of exploitation.",

While it has more specific child CWEs, the provided information doesn't give enough detail to determine if a more specific CWE is applicable. CWE-267 and CWE-639 were considered as secondary CWEs because they offer more specific details related to how the authorization is bypassed.\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe267[\"CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n\n    cwe267 -->|PEEROF| cwe639\n    cwe862 -->|CAN_BE_A_ROOT_CAUSE| cwe267\n    cwe862 -->|CAN_BE_A_ROOT_CAUSE| cwe639\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe267,cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing authorization** checks (CWE-862) when creating new administrator accounts. This leads to **improper authorization** where ordinary users can perform privileged actions, potentially due to the way privileges are defined or through user-controlled keys (CWE-267, CWE-639). The final impact is privilege escalation, data leakage, account takeover, and unauthorized access to administrative functions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is a **missing authorization** check when a user attempts to create a new administrator account. The vulnerability description explicitly states \"**improper authorization**,\" and the CVE reference links content summary mentions \"**missing permission checks**\". The Retriever Results also highlights CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) as a strong candidate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-862 is further justified by the Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance, which states that CWE-862 applies when \"no role/privilege check after login.\" This aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description where ordinary users can create administrator accounts, indicating a **missing authorization** check.\n\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) were considered but deemed less appropriate because they are more general and higher-level. The evidence specifically points to a **missing authorization** check, making CWE-862 a more accurate and specific classification.\n\nCWE-267 and CWE-639 are included as they are more specific and give additional context as to why the authorization is bypassed.\n\nThe final selection of CWEs provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability, starting from the root cause (CWE-862) and highlighting the mechanism of exploitation. The chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, providing a clear and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
