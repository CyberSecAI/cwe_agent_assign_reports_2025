  "description": "The Heateor Social Login WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **authentication bypass** in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.35. This is due to **insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token**. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, if they have access to the email and the user does not have an already-existing account for the service returning the token. An attacker cannot authenticate as an administrator by default, but these accounts are also at risk if authentication for administrators has explicitly been allowed via the social login.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient verification of the user data returned by social login tokens. Specifically, the plugin does not properly verify if the user is the actual owner of the account being used for social login.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n*   **Improper Authentication:** The core weakness is the lack of proper authentication checks, allowing an attacker to bypass the intended login process.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Authentication Bypass:** An unauthenticated attacker can log in as any existing user on the site if they have access to the email and the user does not have an existing account for the service returning the token.\n*   **Account Takeover:** Attackers can gain complete access to existing user accounts.\n*   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** While not default, If social login is explicitly enabled for administrators, it can lead to full site compromise\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Social Login Mechanism:** Exploits the social login functionality of the plugin.\n*   **Email Address:** Requires knowledge of the target user's email address.\n*   **Lack of Account Association:** The vulnerability works when there is no existing account linked to the social login provider on the WordPress site.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to have an account on the target WordPress site.\n*   **Email Address:** The attacker needs to know the email address of the target user\n*   **Social Login:** Requires that the WordPress site utilizes the social login feature of the vulnerable plugin\n\n**Additional Details**\n* The vulnerability was present in versions up to and including 1.1.35 of the \"Heateor Social Login\" WordPress plugin.\n* The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.1.36\n* The fix includes preventing the plugin from fetching email and other user profile data for Disqus and Spotify accounts as they cannot be verified. It also implements a check to ensure that Vkontakte accounts are verified and restricts redirects to only within the website domain.",

CWE-306, Missing Authentication for Critical Function, a Base-level CWE, is a child of CWE-287 and represents a more specific case where authentication is entirely absent. While the vulnerability involves **insufficient verification**, it doesn't explicitly state that authentication is entirely missing, making CWE-287 a more suitable fit. Both authentication and authorization were considered, but authorization CWEs were deemed less relevant due to the **authentication bypass** nature of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token**, leading to **authentication bypass**, and finally resulting in the ability to log in as any existing user on the site.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-287 as the most appropriate CWE due to the **improper authentication** resulting from **insufficient verification** of the social login token. This aligns with the vulnerability description and the provided guidance. The evidence clearly indicates a flaw in the authentication process, where the user's identity is not adequately verified. The retriever results also support this classification, with CWE-287 being a relevant candidate.\n\nThe selection of CWE-287 is based on the following evidence:\n*   **Vulnerability Description:** \"The Heateor Social Login WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **authentication bypass** in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.35. This is due to **insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token**.\"\n*   **CVE Reference Links Content Summary:** \"The vulnerability stems from **insufficient verification** of the user data returned by social login tokens. Specifically, the plugin does not properly verify if the user is the actual owner of the account being used for social login.\"\n\nCWE-306 was also considered, but it represents a complete absence of authentication, which is not the case here. The plugin attempts to authenticate the user, but the verification is insufficient.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-287 captures the general nature of the **improper authentication**, while CWE-306 represents a potential, more specific scenario where authentication is entirely missing.\n\nRelevant CWE

Improper validation of data that are user-controllable can lead to the application processing incorrect, and often malicious, input.\n\n\nFor example, custom cookies commonly store session data or persistent data across sessions. This kind of session data is normally involved in security related decisions on the server side, such as user authentication and access control.
