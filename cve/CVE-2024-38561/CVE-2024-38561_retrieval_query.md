    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'race condition'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 336.54)

The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently....

### 2. CWE-667: Improper Locking (Score: 301.99)

The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors....

### 3. CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition (Score: 301.02)

The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state....

### 4. CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition (Score: 286.36)

The product uses a signal handler that introduces a race condition....

### 5. CWE-662: Improper Synchronization (Score: 279.08)

The product utilizes multiple threads or processes to allow temporary access to a shared resource that can only be exclusive to one process at a time, but it does not properly synchronize these actions, which might cause simultaneous accesses of this resource by multiple threads or processes....

### 3. CWE-911: Improper Update of Reference Count (Score: 296.99)

The product uses a reference count to manage a resource, but it does not update or incorrectly updates the reference count....

### 4. CWE-415: Double Free (Score: 290.26)

The product calls free() twice on the same memory address, potentially leading to modification of unexpected memory locations....

### 5. CWE-416: Use After Free (Score: 278.73)

The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer vali...
