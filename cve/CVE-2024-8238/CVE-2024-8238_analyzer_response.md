# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-94 | Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') | 0.8 | Base | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE |
| CWE-1336 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-94, which represents code injection. CWE-1336, Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine, is a child of CWE-94 and peer of CWE-1336, providing a more specific view of the weakness but is not chosen as the primary. The relationship between these CWEs indicates a potential chain of events where improper neutralization leads to code injection. Abstraction levels influenced the selection, favoring the base level for root cause identification.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **outdated version of safer_getattr() function** which leads to the **weakness** that **str.format_map() can read arbitrary attributes of Python objects**, then potentially leading to unrestricted code execution.
  - Root Cause: Outdated safer_getattr() leading to arbitrary attribute access.
  - Weakness: str.format_map() allows reading arbitrary attributes.
  - Impact: Potential for server-side secret leakage and unrestricted code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability and its potential impact. The primary CWE, CWE-94, aligns well with the unrestricted code execution aspect, stemming from the **improper control of code generation** through the exploitation of `str.format_map()`. The selection is heavily based on the vulnerability description indicating the potential for unrestricted code execution.

The relationship analysis helped refine the selection, particularly the child relationship of CWE-1336 to CWE-94. However, the description emphasizes the broader implication of code injection, making CWE-94 a more appropriate primary classification.

The provided evidence and graph relationships support the chosen CWEs at the optimal level of specificity, indicating the root cause and potential for code injection.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not used because the vulnerability does not directly relate to improperly defined privileges, but rather to the unsafe use of the str.format_map() function.*

## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not used even though it has similar terms related to format string. In this case, the format string is not externally controlled, but rather the **arbitrary attributes of Python objects** that are read.*

## CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows user input to control or influence paths or file names that are used in filesystem operations.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not used because the vulnerability does not stem from external control of file names or paths, even though the vulnerability mentions that an attacker can write files to a known location. The vulnerability is due to the ability of `str.format_map()` to access sensitive variables.*

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not used because the vulnerability doesn't involve path traversal.*

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not used because it is specific to web applications and the manipulation of immutable parameters, while the described vulnerability exists within the AimQL query language and Python's string formatting mechanism.*

## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not used because the vulnerability is not about validating the syntactic correctness of the input but about the access to arbitrary attributes of Python objects due to an outdated function.*

## CWE-36: Absolute Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as "/abs/path" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not used because the vulnerability doesn't involve path traversal.*

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not used because the vulnerability does not involve the storage, transfer, or sharing of sensitive information without proper removal.*

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*This CWE was not used because the vulnerability does not involve the incorrect implementation of an authentication algorithm.*

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.
