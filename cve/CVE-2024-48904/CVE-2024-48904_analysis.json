Additionally, the CANPRECEDE relationships of CWE-184 (Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs) to CWE-78 suggests a potential vulnerability chain.

This results in Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the affected system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, particularly the vulnerability description and CVE reference content summary. The vulnerability is explicitly identified as a **command injection** vulnerability, which aligns with CWE-78.\n\nThe selection of CWE-78 is at the base level of specificity, as it directly reflects the nature of the **command injection** vulnerability targeting OS commands.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
