  "description": "Git Credential Manager (GCM) is a secure Git credential helper built on .NET that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The Git credential protocol is text-based over standard input/output, and consists of a series of lines of key-value pairs in the format `key=value`. Gits documentation restricts the use of the NUL (`\\\\0`) character and newlines to form part of the keys or values. When Git reads from standard input, it considers both LF and CRLF as newline characters for the credential protocol by virtue of calling `strbuf_getline` that calls to `strbuf_getdelim_strip_crlf`. Git also validates that a newline is not present in the value by checking for the presence of the line-feed character (LF, `\\\\n`), and errors if this is the case. This captures both LF and CRLF-type newlines. Git Credential Manager uses the .NET standard library `StreamReader` class to read the standard input stream line-by-line and parse the `key=value` credential protocol format. The implementation of the `ReadLineAsync` method considers LF, CRLF, and CR as valid line endings. This is means that .NET considers a single CR as a valid newline character, whereas Git does not. This **mismatch of newline treatment between Git and GCM** means that an attacker can craft a malicious remote URL. When a user clones or otherwise interacts with a malicious repository that requires authentication, the attacker can capture credentials for another Git remote. The attack is also heightened when cloning from repositories with submodules when using the `--recursive` clone option as the user is not able to inspect the submodule remote URLs beforehand. This issue has been patched in version 2.6.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should only interact with trusted remote repositories, and not clone with `--recursive` to allow inspection of any submodule URLs before cloning those submodules.",

The fix involves ensuring that GCM correctly interprets newline characters to align with Git's expected behavior.\n- Workarounds include only interacting with trusted remote repositories and avoiding the use of the `--recursive` option when cloning.\n```",

This allows an attacker to craft a malicious remote URL that can capture credentials for another Git remote. The ultimate impact is **insufficiently protected credentials** (CWE-522).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is the **mismatch of newline treatment between Git and GCM**, as stated in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\". The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the root cause involves the .NET `StreamReader` class treating CR as a valid newline, while Git expects LF or CRLF. This leads to a credential leak, thus CWE-522.\n\nThe retriever results suggest CWE-93 as a strong candidate, which aligns with the newline handling issue. CWE-113 is also relevant as it is a variant of CWE-93 and deals with HTTP headers.\n\nCWE-78, CWE-88, and CWE-427 were considered but deemed less relevant because the vulnerability's core issue is CRLF injection and not command injection or search path manipulation.\n\nThe selection of CWE-93 as the primary CWE is based on its direct relevance to the **improper neutralization of CRLF sequences**, which is the root cause of the vulnerability. CWE-113 is included as it specifies the context of HTTP headers, and CWE-522 to show the impact. These CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity for describing the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
