# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-39676

## Vulnerability Description
**Exposure of Sensitive Information** to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in Apache Pinot. This issue affects Apache Pinot from 0.1 before 1.0.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.0.0 and configure RBAC, which fixes the issue. Details When using a request to path /appconfigs to the controller, it can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information such as system information (e.g. arch, os version), environment information (e.g. maxHeapSize) and Pinot configurations (e.g. zookeeper path). This issue was addressed by the Role-based Access Control https//docs.pinot.apache.org/operators/tutorials/authentication/basic-auth-access-control , so that /appConfigs` and all other APIs can be access controlled. Only authorized users have access to it. Note the user needs to add the admin role accordingly to the RBAC guide to control access to this endpoint, and in the future version of Pinot, a default admin role is planned to be added.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **Exposure of Sensitive Information**
- **impact:** Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor and disclosure of sensitive information
- **vector:** request to path /appconfigs to the controller
- **attacker:** unauthorized actor
- **product:** Apache Pinot
- **version:** 0.1 before 1.0.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-39676:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the exposure of the `/appconfigs` endpoint in Apache Pinot versions prior to 1.0.0. This endpoint, without proper access control, discloses sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Lack of Access Control:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper access control on the `/appconfigs` endpoint. This allows unauthorized actors to access the endpoint and retrieve sensitive information.
- **Information Exposure:** The `/appconfigs` endpoint leaks sensitive information, including:
    - System information (e.g., arch, OS version)
    - Environment information (e.g., maxHeapSize)
    - Pinot configurations (e.g., Zookeeper path)

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can obtain sensitive system, environment, and configuration data, which can be used to gain further knowledge about the system, plan further attacks or compromise the system itself.
-  Potentially can lead to further compromise of the system based on the information gathered.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** An attacker with network access to the Apache Pinot controller can send a request to the `/appconfigs` endpoint.
- **Unauthorized Endpoint Access:** The attacker exploits the lack of authentication and authorization on the `/appconfigs` endpoint to retrieve the sensitive information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Apache Pinot controller where the vulnerable endpoint is exposed.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any credentials to access the vulnerable endpoint prior to the fix in 1.0.0

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
