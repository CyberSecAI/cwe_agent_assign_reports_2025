# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-6126

## Vulnerability Description
A flaw was found in the cockpit package. This flaw allows an authenticated user to kill any process when enabling the pam_envs user_readenv option, which leads to a denial of service (DoS) attack.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** denial of service (DoS)
- **vector:** kill any process
- **attacker:** authenticated user
- **product:** cockpit package

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6126

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the cockpit component's use of `pam-ssh-add`, which processes the `SSH_AGENT_PID` environment variable.
- The `pam-ssh-add` component converts the `SSH_AGENT_PID` environment variable to an integer using `atoi()`. If the `user_readenv` option is enabled in `pam_env` and an attacker can manipulate the content of `SSH_AGENT_PID`, `atoi()` can return a large number that is not the real PID.
- Cockpit then attempts to kill the process with the manipulated PID.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation of the `SSH_AGENT_PID` environment variable within the `pam-ssh-add` component.
- Usage of `atoi()` function which doesn't perform error checking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An authenticated user, with the ability to manipulate the `SSH_AGENT_PID` environment variable, can kill arbitrary processes.
- This leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker must have valid authentication to access the system via cockpit.
- The attacker must be able to manipulate the `SSH_AGENT_PID` environment variable, this is possible if `user_readenv` option is enabled in pam\_env.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated user with access to the cockpit interface.
- Ability to influence the content of the `SSH_AGENT_PID` environment variable via pam\_env.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves replacing the vulnerable `atoi()` call with `strtol()` with error checking to prevent the overflow.

**Affected Products:**
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (x86_64, IBM z Systems, Power little endian, ARM 64)
