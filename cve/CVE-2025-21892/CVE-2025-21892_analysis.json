  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved RDMA/mlx5 Fix the recovery flow of the UMR QP This patch addresses an issue in the recovery flow of the UMR QP, ensuring tasks do not get stuck, as highlighted by the call trace [1]. During recovery, before transitioning the QP to the RESET state, the software must wait for all outstanding WRs to complete. Failing to do so can cause the firmware to skip sending some flushed CQEs with errors and simply discard them upon the RESET, as per the IB specification. This **race condition** can result in lost CQEs and tasks becoming stuck. To resolve this, the patch sends a final WR which serves only as a barrier before moving the QP state to RESET. Once a CQE is received for that final WR, it guarantees that no outstanding WRs remain, making it safe to transition the QP to RESET and subsequently back to RTS, restoring proper functionality. Note For the barrier WR, we simply reuse the failed and ready WR. Since the QP is in an error state, it will only receive IB_WC_WR_FLUSH_ERR. However, as it serves only as a barrier we dont care about its status. [1] INFO task rdma_resource_l1922 blocked for more than 120 seconds.

CWE-367 is a Base-level CWE that describes a specific type of **race condition** (TOCTOU). CWE-367 is a child of CWE-362, making it a more specific candidate.

The report explicitly mentions a **race condition** in the RDMA/mlx5 component of the Linux kernel. The evidence supports this, as quoted: \"This **race condition** can result in lost CQEs and tasks becoming stuck.\" Based on the retriever results, CWE-362 was identified as the most relevant CWE, with a high score. While CWE-367 is a more specific type of **race condition**, the vulnerability description doesn't specifically point to a time-of-check time-of-use issue.
