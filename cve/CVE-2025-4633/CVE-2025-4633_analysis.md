# Analysis for CVE-2025-4633

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1392 | Use of Default Credentials | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The application uses default credentials, allowing unauthorized access. |
| CWE-288 | Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. Default credentials provide an alternate channel for authentication, bypassing the intended authentication process. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-1392, representing the **use of default credentials**, which directly enables an **authentication bypass**, potentially aligning with CWE-288. The relationship is that the presence of default credentials (CWE-1392) provides an alternate, unintended channel for authentication (CWE-288). The abstraction level of CWE-1392 is Base, which is a preferred level.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **use of default credentials** (CWE-1392), which leads to an **authentication bypass** (CWE-288), ultimately allowing unauthorized access to the web portal.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary vulnerability is the **use of default credentials** (CWE-1392). The presence of default credentials provides an alternate channel for authentication, effectively bypassing the intended authentication process, which aligns with CWE-288. The selection of CWE-1392 is based on the vulnerability description stating, "**Default credentials** were present in the web portal...allowing an unauthenticated malicious actor to log in via the web portal."

CWEs considered but not used:

*   CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials): While similar, the description specifically mentions **default credentials**, not necessarily hard-coded ones.
*   CWE-1393 (Use of Default Password): This is a more specific case of CWE-1392. CWE-1392 is preferred here as it is more encompassing of any kind of default credentials not just passwords.
* CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password): Similar to CWE-798, this focuses on "hard-coded" passwords which is not described in the vulnerability description.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials

## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1393: Use of Default Password
