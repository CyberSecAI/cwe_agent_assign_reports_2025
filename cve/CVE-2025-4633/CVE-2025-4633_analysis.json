The application uses default credentials, allowing unauthorized access. |\n| CWE-288 | Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. Default credentials provide an alternate channel for authentication, bypassing the intended authentication process. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-1392, representing the **use of default credentials**, which directly enables an **authentication bypass**, potentially aligning with CWE-288. The relationship is that the presence of default credentials (CWE-1392) provides an alternate, unintended channel for authentication (CWE-288). The abstraction level of CWE-1392 is Base, which is a preferred level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1392[\"CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\"]\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    \n    cwe1392 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe288\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1392 primary\n    class cwe288 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of default credentials** (CWE-1392), which leads to an **authentication bypass** (CWE-288), ultimately allowing unauthorized access to the web portal.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is the **use of default credentials** (CWE-1392). The presence of default credentials provides an alternate channel for authentication, effectively bypassing the intended authentication process, which aligns with CWE-288. The selection of CWE-1392 is based on the vulnerability description stating, \"**Default credentials** were present in the web portal...allowing an unauthenticated malicious actor to log in via the web portal.\"\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials): While similar, the description specifically mentions **default credentials**, not necessarily hard-coded ones.\n*   CWE-1393 (Use of Default Password): This is a more specific case of CWE-1392. CWE-1392 is preferred here as it is more encompassing of any kind of default credentials not just passwords.\n* CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password): Similar to CWE-798, this focuses on \"hard-coded\"
