CWE-425 **Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')** is a peer that can also lead to the same impact. We choose CWE-306 as the root cause since the description focuses on **insufficient access control**, so the **missing authentication** seems more relevant.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n\n    cwe200 <--|CANPRECEDE| cwe306\n    cwe200 <--|CANPRECEDE| cwe425\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with CWE-306 **Missing Authentication for Critical Function**. Because authentication is missing, an attacker can directly access sensitive information, leading to CWE-200 **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe vulnerability is due to **insufficient access control mechanisms** that allow sensitive information to be viewed by unauthorized users. The attacker does not need to be authenticated. This clearly points to CWE-306 **Missing Authentication for Critical Function**, which is a Base level CWE and thus preferred. The vulnerability description key phrases state the impact as \"**Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**,\" which aligns with the potential impact of CWE-306.\n\nCWE-200 **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** is listed as a Class level CWE. While the vulnerability ultimately results in exposure of sensitive information, CWE-200 is a symptom rather than the root cause. The mapping notes state that CWE-200 is discouraged since it represents the impact, not the root cause.\n\nCWE-425 **Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')** is also a possible candidate. However, it is more specific to web applications that do not adequately enforce authorization on restricted URLs, scripts, or files. The description provided does not indicate whether this is a web application issue or a more general access control problem. The text says \"**insufficient access control mechanisms**\", and because the attacker does not need to be authenticated, this leans towards **Missing Authentication for Critical Function**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n- **CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function**\n  - The product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n  - \"The vulnerability is due to **insufficient access control mechanisms** that allow sensitive information to be viewed by unauthorized users.\"\n  - \"The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.\"",
