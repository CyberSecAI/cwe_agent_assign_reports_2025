  "description": "The HUSKY - Products Filter Professional for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Insecure Direct Object Reference** in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.6.1 via the woof_messenger_remove_subscr AJAX action due to **missing validation on the key user controlled key**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to unsubscribe users from a product notification sign-ups, if they can successfully obtain or brute force the key value for users who signed up to receive notifications. This vulnerability requires the plugins Products Messenger extension to be enabled.",

  "reference_content": "**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability is due to a missing validation on the 'key' parameter within the `woof_messenger_remove_subscr` AJAX action. This allows attackers to unsubscribe users from product notifications by manipulating the 'key' value.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR): The lack of proper authorization checks on the 'key' parameter allows attackers to directly manipulate data (user subscriptions) by referencing the internal key.\n- Missing authorization: The AJAX action `woof_messenger_remove_subscr` does not properly validate if the user making the request has the permission to unsubscribe the targeted user.\n- Insufficient input validation: The 'key' parameter is sanitized with `sanitize_key` function but not validated against the user ID before unsubscription.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nAn authenticated attacker (with subscriber-level access or higher) can unsubscribe other users from product notification sign-ups. This can disrupt the notification service and potentially affect a large number of users who rely on those notifications.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The attacker needs to send a crafted AJAX request to `woof_messenger_remove_subscr` action with the user ID and the targeted user's subscription 'key'.\n- The attacker can try to brute-force the 'key' values, if they are not generated with sufficient randomness.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to be authenticated on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level access.\n- The Products Messenger extension of the plugin must be enabled on the WordPress site.\n- The attacker needs to obtain or brute-force the key value associated with the user's subscription.\n\n**Additional details from the provided content:**\n- The vulnerability was discovered by shaman0x01 from Shaman Red Team.\n- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.3.6.2 and later.\n- The fix includes an additional check in the  `woof_messenger_remove_subscr` function in `ext/products_messenger/index.php` to compare the current user's id to the `user_id` parameter in the request before proceeding with the unsubscription.\n- The `readme.txt` and `index.php` files confirm the change in version number from 1.3.6.2 to 1.3.6.3, indicating a patch was released.",

CWE-639 is a more specific Base level CWE that describes the authorization bypass. CWE-862, as a Class, is a broader categorization of missing authorization. Both CWEs are related to authorization issues, with CWE-639 providing more specific context to the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe639 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **missing validation** of a user-controlled key. This **missing validation** leads to an **authorization bypass**, allowing authenticated attackers to unsubscribe users from product notification sign-ups.\n\nRoot Cause: **Missing validation on the key user controlled key** -> CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\nImpact: Unsubscribe users from product notification sign-ups\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is strongly based on the provided evidence, specifically the keyphrase \"missing validation on the key user controlled key\". This phrase directly points to a weakness related to authorization and user-controlled input. The provided keyphrase analysis consistently identifies CWE-639 as the most relevant CWE for the root cause.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting the hierarchical structure of CWEs related to access control and authorization. CWE-639 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the vulnerability's mechanism: authorization bypass via a user-controlled key. While CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is a related concern, it is less specific than CWE-639.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
