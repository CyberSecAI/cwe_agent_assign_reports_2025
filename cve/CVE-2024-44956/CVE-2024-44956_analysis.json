  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/xe/preempt_fence **enlarge the fence critical section** It is really easy to introduce subtle **deadlock**s in preempt_fence_work_func() since we operate on single global ordered-wq for signalling our preempt fences behind the scenes, so even though we signal a particular fence, everything in the callback should be in the fence critical section, since blocking in the callback will prevent other published fences from signalling. If we **enlarge the fence critical section** to cover the entire callback, then lockdep should be able to understand this better, and complain if we grab a sensitive lock like vm->lock, which is also held when waiting on preempt fences.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content relates to a fix for a potential deadlock issue in the Linux kernel's `drm/xe/preempt_fence` subsystem.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause of the issue is a potential deadlock in `preempt_fence_work_func()`. This function operates on a single global ordered workqueue (wq) to signal preempt fences. The issue is that the callback function associated with fence signaling was not entirely within the fence's critical section. Blocking in this callback could prevent other fences from being signaled, leading to a deadlock scenario. Specifically, if the callback grabs a lock like `vm->lock`, which is also held while waiting for preempt fences, it could cause a deadlock.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n- **Potential deadlock:** The primary weakness is the possibility of a deadlock due to improper handling of the critical section related to preempt fence signaling.\n- **Improper critical section:** The original code did not keep the entire callback function in the fence critical section, which allowed for the possibility of lock contention and deadlock.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n-   **System hang:** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a system hang due to the deadlock.\n-   **Denial of service:** The deadlock effectively causes a denial of service because the system becomes unresponsive.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n-   **Malicious GPU operations:** An attacker could craft specific GPU operations to trigger the vulnerable code path, causing the deadlock.\n-   **Triggering preempt fences:** By creating a scenario that triggers multiple preempt fences, an attacker could increase the likelihood of a deadlock occurring.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n-   **Access to the graphics subsystem:** The attacker needs the ability to interact with the graphics subsystem, specifically the Intel Xe graphics driver, to trigger the vulnerability.\n-   **Knowledge of preempt fence operations:** The attacker would likely need knowledge of how preempt fences work to craft a scenario that leads to a deadlock.",
