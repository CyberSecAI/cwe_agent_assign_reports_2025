  "description": "The Big File Uploads - Increase Maximum File Upload Size plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.2. This is due the plugin **not sanitizing a file path in an error message**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the plugin's failure to sanitize a file path within an error message. This allows the full server path of the application to be revealed.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n* **Full Path Disclosure:** The plugin displays the server's file path in an error message when an upload fails, specifically in the `ajax_chunk_receiver` function.\n* **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not sanitize the file path before including it in the error message.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n* **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain knowledge of the web application's full path, potentially aiding further malicious activities.\n* **Limited Direct Impact:** The vulnerability itself is not directly exploitable for immediate harm, but provides information useful in combination with other vulnerabilities.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n* **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network through HTTP requests to the vulnerable plugin endpoint.\n* **File Upload Process:** The vulnerability is triggered during the file upload process, when an error occurs due to issues with writing the file.\n* **Error Message:** The vulnerable file path is exposed in an error message generated by the plugin.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n* **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have author-level or higher privileges in WordPress to access the vulnerable functionality.\n* **Upload Files Capability:** The user must be able to upload files.\n* **Ability to Cause Upload Errors**: The attacker needs to be able to cause the upload process to fail in a way that triggers the vulnerable code path.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerable code is located in the `ajax_chunk_receiver` function, specifically when handling chunked uploads.\n*   The vulnerable file path is displayed in the `message` key in the json response or in an HTML error message if short is defined in the request.\n*   The vulnerability is present in versions <= 2.1.2 of the Big File Uploads plugin.\n*   Version 2.1.3 of the plugin addresses this vulnerability by removing the file path from the error message.\n\nThis information provides more specific details than the original CVE description placeholder and it is relevant to the identified CVE.",

The root cause is the **failure to sanitize a file path in an error message**, leading to the disclosure of sensitive path information. |\n| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The sensitive file path is included in the error message, which is then sent back to the user. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of CWE-209 to the vulnerability description's root cause: the **generation of an error message containing sensitive information** due to **not sanitizing a file path**. CWE-201 was considered because the sensitive information is being \"inserted\" into data that is \"sent\".\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n\n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe209\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe209 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of input sanitization** leading to **full path disclosure** in an error message.\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Not sanitizing a file path in an error message** (CWE-209).\n2.  **Weakness:** Full Path Disclosure.\n3.  **Impact:** Information Disclosure (potential aid for further attacks).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\". The root cause is explicitly stated as \"**not sanitizing a file path in an error message**.\" This directly aligns with CWE-209 (Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information). The retriever results also listed CWE-209 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) was also considered because the sensitive information (the file path) is included in an error message that is sent back to the user.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause and the immediate consequence of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of
