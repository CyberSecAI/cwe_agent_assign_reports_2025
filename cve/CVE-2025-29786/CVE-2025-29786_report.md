# Analysis Report for CVE-2025-29786

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-29786

## Description

Expr is an expression language and expression evaluation for Go. Prior to version 1.17.0, if the Expr expression parser is given an **unbounded input string**, it will attempt to compile the entire string and generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node for each part of the expression. In scenarios where input size isnt limited, a malicious or inadvertent extremely large expression can consume excessive memory as the parser builds a huge AST. This can ultimately lead to*excessive memory usage and an Out-Of-Memory (OOM) crash of the process. This issue is relatively uncommon and will only manifest when there are no restrictions on the input size, i.e. the expression length is allowed to grow arbitrarily large. In typical use cases where inputs are bounded or validated, this problem would not occur. The problem has been patched in the latest versions of the Expr library. The fix introduces compile-time limits on the number of AST nodes and memory usage during parsing, preventing any single expression from exhausting resources. Users should upgrade to Expr version 1.17.0 or later, as this release includes the new node budget and memory limit safeguards. Upgrading to v1.17.0 ensures that extremely deep or large expressions are detected and safely aborted during compilation, avoiding the OOM condition. For users who cannot immediately upgrade, the recommended workaround is to impose an input size restriction before parsing. In practice, this means validating or limiting the length of expression strings that your application will accept. For example, set a maximum allowable number of characters (or nodes) for any expression and reject or truncate inputs that exceed this limit. By ensuring no unbounded-length expression is ever fed into the parser, one can prevent the parser from constructing a pathologically large AST and avoid potential memory exhaustion. In short, pre-validate and cap input size as a safeguard in the absence of the patch.

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the parent-child relationship between CWE-770 and CWE-789. CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) is a broader category, and CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) is a more specific variant. The vulnerability involves allocating memory without limits, which aligns with CWE-770. The specific allocation being based on an excessive size value is captured by CWE-789.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **unbounded input string**. This leads to **allocation of resources without limits or throttling** (CWE-770), specifically **memory allocation with an excessive size value** (CWE-789). The final impact is excessive memory usage and an Out-Of-Memory (OOM) crash.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment focused on the **unbounded input string** and its consequences. The primary weakness is the lack of limits on resource allocation, specifically memory. The evidence clearly points to CWE-770 as the root cause, with CWE-789 providing a more specific description of the memory allocation issue.

The retriever results suggested several CWEs, including CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity), CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion), and CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input). However, these CWEs did not directly address the core issue of unlimited resource allocation. The closest matches were CWE-770 and CWE-789, which were selected based on their relevance to the vulnerability description and the CWE specifications.

The final selection of CWE-770 and CWE-789 provides the optimal level of specificity. CWE-770 captures the overall weakness of allocating resources without limits, while CWE-789 specifies the type of resource being allocated (memory) and the reason for the excessive allocation (excessive size value).
