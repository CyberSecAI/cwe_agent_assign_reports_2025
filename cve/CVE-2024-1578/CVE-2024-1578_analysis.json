  "description": "The MiCard PLUS Ci and MiCard PLUS BLE reader products developed by rf IDEAS and rebranded by NT-ware have a **firmware fault** that may result in characters randomly being dropped from some ID card reads, which would result in the wrong ID card number being assigned during ID card self-registration and might result in failed login attempts for end-users. Random characters being dropped from ID card numbers compromises the uniqueness of ID cards that can, therefore, result in a security issue if the users are using the ID card self-registration function.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-1578:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe root cause is a firmware fault in the rf IDEAS MiCard PLUS Ci and MiCard PLUS BLE card readers, which can randomly drop characters during ID card reads. This issue is present in specific firmware versions of the card readers.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- The primary vulnerability is the inconsistent reading of ID cards, leading to dropped characters. This compromises the uniqueness of ID card numbers.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n-   **Compromised User Identification:** If users rely on the 'ID card self-registration' function, the dropped characters can lead to incorrect or incomplete ID card data. This can result in users being incorrectly associated with another user\u2019s account.\n-   **Unauthorized Access:** A malicious user could potentially gain access to another user's secure print jobs or scan profiles by exploiting the character dropping issue during the registration process.\n-   **Failed Logins:** End-users may experience failed login attempts due to the misread ID cards.\n-   **Security Issue:** The vulnerability leads to a security issue if the dropped characters result in the same identifier as another user and could result in privilege escalation\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n-   **Physical Access:** The attack vector requires physical access to the card readers to trigger the vulnerability.\n-   **ID Card Self-Registration:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user attempts to register their ID card via the 'ID card self-registration' feature while using the affected card readers.\n-   **Low Complexity ID Cards:** The likelihood of exploitation increases when ID cards use a low level of complexity and short character lengths.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n-   **Physical Proximity:** An attacker must be in a position to use an ID card with the vulnerable card reader.\n-   **Low-Level Access (User):** The attacker would need to be a user within the system who has the ability to register their ID card.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n-   The vulnerability is present in card readers rebranded by NT-ware, but originally developed and provided by rf IDEAS.\n-   The document provides specific affected firmware versions for both the MiCard PLUS Ci and MiCard PLUS BLE readers.\n-   NT-ware recommends mitigation steps like disabling the ID card self-registration, reviewing registered cards for inconsistencies and enabling multi-factor authentication until the firmware can be updated.\n-   The document provides updated firmware versions that fix this vulnerability.\n\nThis information provides more specific details about the affected products, the attack scenarios, and mitigation than the general CVE description.",

The vulnerability description states, \"The MiCard PLUS Ci and MiCard PLUS BLE reader products...have a **firmware fault** that may result in characters randomly being dropped from some ID card reads...\".
