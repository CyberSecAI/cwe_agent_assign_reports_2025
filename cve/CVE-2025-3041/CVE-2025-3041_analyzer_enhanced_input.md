## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-3041 Content

Based on the provided content, this report details a vulnerability in "projectworlds Online Time Table Generator Portal-Source code" related to unrestricted file uploads, leading to potential remote code execution. This **relates** to a security vulnerability.

Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The file upload functionality in `/admin/updatestudent.php` lacks proper validation of user-supplied files. Specifically, it's missing file type checks and extension filtering.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
*   Remote Code Execution via Unrestricted File Upload

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Malware Distribution
*   Remote Code Execution (RCE)
*   Data Breach
*   Denial of Service (DoS)
*   Web Shell Installation
*   Bypassing Security Controls
*   Reputation Damage

**Attack vectors:**

*   Uploading a malicious PHP script (e.g., "shell.php") via the upload form in `/admin/updatestudent.php`.
*   The script is stored in a web-accessible directory (`../student/image/$email/`) without sanitization.
*   Accessing the uploaded file via HTTP requests allows for remote code execution.
*   The vulnerable parameter is the file upload field: `$_FILES['pic']['name']` (POST request).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to submit a POST request to `/admin/updatestudent.php` with a malicious file.
*   No authentication is explicitly mentioned as a requirement in the provided text, suggesting the upload may be accessible without login.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Input Validation & Filtering**:  Restrict allowed characters in the filename.
*   **Filename Sanitization**:  Strictly validate uploaded filenames and restrict allowed file extensions.
*   **Randomized Storage Names**: Generate randomized filenames.
*   **File Type Verification**: Validate both file extensions and MIME types.
*   **Storage Directory Permissions**: Store uploaded files in a non-web-accessible directory or disable script execution.
*   **Server Configuration**: Configure the server to disable script execution in upload directories.
*   **Error Handling**: Use custom error pages to avoid exposing internal path details.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The content provides a Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrating the vulnerability, including example code and screenshots.
*   Specific file paths and parameters are identified.
*   The affected and fixed versions are specified (Affected Version: Current release as of 2025-03-14, Fixed Version: Not patched as of vulnerability disclosure).
*   The submitter is identified as IEeee.
*   Links to the vendor homepage and software download are provided.
