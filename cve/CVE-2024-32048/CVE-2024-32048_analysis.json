This **root cause** allows an attacker to send malicious input. The impact of this malicious input results in **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)**, leading to a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)** as the primary weakness, which then leads to a denial-of-service condition through **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)**.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-20** is based on the explicit statement in the vulnerability description: \"**Improper input validation** in the Intel(R) Distribution of OpenVINO(TM) Model Server software before version 2024.0 may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via adjacent access.\" This is further supported by the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" stating the \"**Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the OpenVINO\u2122 Model Server software.\"\n\n**CWE-400** is included because the **impact** of the **Improper Input Validation** is a \"denial of service\". **CWE-400** directly relates to uncontrolled resource consumption, which is a common cause of denial-of-service attacks.\n\nThe evidence is somewhat limited, preventing selection of a more specific **Base** or **Variant** CWE, reducing the confidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input or data, but it\n        does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the\n        properties that are required to process the data safely and\n        correctly.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287].
