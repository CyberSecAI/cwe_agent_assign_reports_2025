Given the lack of specific detail in the vulnerability description, the Class-level CWE-285 was deemed most appropriate. The secondary consideration was CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor), which represents the impact of the authorization failure.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe200 -->|IMPACT| cwe285\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper authorization**, leading to the **exposure of sensitive information**.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-285 Improper Authorization\n  - **Impact:** CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered several CWEs related to authentication and authorization, but the core issue appears to be an authorization **failure**, where a user without the necessary permissions can access sensitive data. The selection of CWE-285 is based on the root cause of the vulnerability; the **failure** to properly authorize access to Elastic Agent policies. The secondary weakness, CWE-200, represents the resulting exposure of sensitive information.\n\nThe selection of CWE-285 is at the Class level due to a lack of more specific information about the exact mechanism of the authorization bypass. If more details were available (e.g., specific parameters being manipulated), a more specific Base or Variant level CWE might be more appropriate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
