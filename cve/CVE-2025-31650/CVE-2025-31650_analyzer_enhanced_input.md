# Vulnerability Description

    Improper **Input Validation vulnerability** in Apache Tomcat. **Incorrect error handling** for some invalid HTTP priority headers resulted in incomplete clean-up of the failed request which created a **memory leak**. A large number of such requests could trigger an OutOfMemoryException resulting in a denial of service. This issue affects Apache Tomcat from 9.0.76 through 9.0.102, from 10.1.10 through 10.1.39, from 11.0.0-M2 through 11.0.5. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.0.104, 10.1.40 or 11.0.6 which fix the issue.
