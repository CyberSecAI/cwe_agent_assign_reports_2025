# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-6069

## Vulnerability Description
The Registration Forms - User Registration Forms, Invitation-Based Registrations, Front-end User Profile, Login Form & Content Restriction plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized arbitrary plugin installation and activation/deactivation due to **missing capability checks** on the pieregister_install_addon, pieregister_activate_addon and pieregister_deactivate_addon functions in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.3.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to install, activate and deactivate arbitrary plugins. As a result attackers might achieve code execution on the targeted server

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **product:** Registration Forms - User Registration Forms, Invitation-Based Registrations, Front-end User Profile, Login Form & Content Restriction plugin for WordPress
- **version:** up to and including 3.8.3.4
- **component:** pieregister_install_addon and pieregister_activate_addon and pieregister_deactivate_addon functions

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2024-6069:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
   - The provided content, particularly from Wordfence, directly refers to **CVE-2024-6069** and describes a vulnerability in "Pie Register - Basic" plugin (<= 3.8.3.4).  This matches the CVE ID provided and makes the content related to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**
   - The root cause of the vulnerability is a **missing authorization check** on the `pieregister_install_addon` function.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**
   -   **Missing Authorization:** The plugin lacks proper verification of user permissions before allowing plugin installation.  Specifically, the `pieregister_install_addon` function does not properly check if the user has the necessary capabilities to perform plugin installations. This allows unauthorized users to trigger the functionality.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**
    - **Arbitrary Plugin Installation:** Attackers can install arbitrary plugins on the WordPress site.
    - **Code Execution:** Installation of arbitrary plugins can lead to code execution on the targeted server, as installed plugins can contain malicious code.
    -  **Privilege Escalation:** Lower-privileged authenticated users are able to elevate to administrator level to install malicious plugins and thus take over the vulnerable site.

**5. Attack Vectors**
   -   **Network:** The vulnerability is exposed via the WordPress site's web interface.
   -   **Authenticated Access:** Attackers must have at least subscriber-level access to the WordPress site.
   -   **Direct Function Call:** Attackers call the vulnerable `pieregister_install_addon` function directly.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
   -   **Authenticated User**: The attacker must be a registered user on the WordPress site with at least 'subscriber' level access.
   -   **Network Access**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the WordPress site over the network.
   -   **Knowledge of Vulnerability**: The attacker must know about the missing authorization vulnerability in the `pieregister_install_addon` function.

**Additional Details From Content (Beyond CVE Description)**

* The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 3.8.3.4
* The Wordfence article mentions specific lines in the plugin code that are involved ([plugins.trac.wordpress.org](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/pie-register/tags/3.8.3.4/pie-register.php#L794), [plugins.trac.wordpress.org](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/pie-register/tags/3.8.3.4/pie-register.php#L727), [plugins.trac.wordpress.org](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/pie-register/tags/3.8.3.4/pie-register.php#L761)

In summary, this vulnerability in the Pie Register plugin stems from a missing capability check, allowing low-privilege authenticated users to install arbitrary plugins on a WordPress site. This results in a high risk of arbitrary code execution.
