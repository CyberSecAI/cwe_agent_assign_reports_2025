  "description": "The Registration Forms - User Registration Forms, Invitation-Based Registrations, Front-end User Profile, Login Form & Content Restriction plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized arbitrary plugin installation and activation/deactivation due to **missing capability checks** on the pieregister_install_addon, pieregister_activate_addon and pieregister_deactivate_addon functions in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.3.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to install, activate and deactivate arbitrary plugins. As a result attackers might achieve code execution on the targeted server",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2024-6069:\n\n**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**\n   - The provided content, particularly from Wordfence, directly refers to **CVE-2024-6069** and describes a vulnerability in \"Pie Register - Basic\" plugin (<= 3.8.3.4).  This matches the CVE ID provided and makes the content related to the CVE.\n\n**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**\n   - The root cause of the vulnerability is a **missing authorization check** on the `pieregister_install_addon` function.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**\n   -   **Missing Authorization:** The plugin lacks proper verification of user permissions before allowing plugin installation.  Specifically, the `pieregister_install_addon` function does not properly check if the user has the necessary capabilities to perform plugin installations. This allows unauthorized users to trigger the functionality.\n\n**4. Impact of Exploitation**\n    - **Arbitrary Plugin Installation:** Attackers can install arbitrary plugins on the WordPress site.\n    - **Code Execution:** Installation of arbitrary plugins can lead to code execution on the targeted server, as installed plugins can contain malicious code.\n    -  **Privilege Escalation:** Lower-privileged authenticated users are able to elevate to administrator level to install malicious plugins and thus take over the vulnerable site.\n\n**5. Attack Vectors**\n   -   **Network:** The vulnerability is exposed via the WordPress site's web interface.\n   -   **Authenticated Access:** Attackers must have at least subscriber-level access to the WordPress site.\n   -   **Direct Function Call:** Attackers call the vulnerable `pieregister_install_addon` function directly.\n\n**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**\n   -   **Authenticated User**: The attacker must be a registered user on the WordPress site with at least 'subscriber' level access.\n   -   **Network Access**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the WordPress site over the network.\n   -   **Knowledge of Vulnerability**: The attacker must know about the missing authorization vulnerability in the `pieregister_install_addon` function.\n\n**Additional Details From Content (Beyond CVE Description)**\n\n* The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 3.8.3.4\n* The Wordfence article mentions specific lines in the plugin code that are involved ([plugins.trac.wordpress.org](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/pie-register/tags/3.8.3.4/pie-register.php#L794), [plugins.trac.wordpress.org](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/pie-register/tags/3.8.3.4/pie-register.php#L727), [plugins.trac.wordpress.org](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/pie-register/tags/3.8.3.4/pie-register.php#L761)\n\nIn summary, this vulnerability in the Pie Register plugin stems from a missing capability check, allowing low-privilege authenticated users to install arbitrary plugins on a WordPress site. This results in a high risk of arbitrary code execution.",

Although it is a class-level CWE, it is the most accurate representation of the **missing capability checks**. There is no evidence to suggest a more specific base-level CWE should be used. Additionally, CWE-862 can lead to CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) because the **missing authorization** allows for arbitrary plugin installation, which could include dangerous file types.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe434[\"CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\"]\n\n    cwe434 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe434 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing capability checks** (CWE-862), which leads to unauthorized arbitrary plugin installation. The ability to install arbitrary plugins can then lead to the upload of files with dangerous types (CWE-434), potentially resulting in code execution on the targeted server.\n  - CWE-862 (Root Cause): Missing Authorization\n  - CWE-434 (Impact): Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the provided CVE reference summary. The key evidence is the explicit mention of \"**missing capability checks**\" in the vulnerability description. The CVE reference summary further clarifies that the root cause is a **missing authorization check** on the `pieregister_install_addon` function.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the selection by highlighting potential follow-on weaknesses that could arise due to the initial **missing authorization**. CWE-434 was added to reflect the potential for unrestricted upload of dangerous file types as a consequence of the initial flaw.\n\nCWE-862 is selected as the primary CWE due to the direct evidence of **missing authorization** in the vulnerability description and supporting CVE reference content. While it is a Class-level CWE, the information provided does not point to a more specific Base or Variant. CWE-434 is a secondary CWE that highlights the potential for uploading dangerous files.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially
