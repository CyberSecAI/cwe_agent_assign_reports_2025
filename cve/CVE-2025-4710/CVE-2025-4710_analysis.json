The github issue provides more detail than a typical CVE description.\n\nHere's the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nAttackers inject malicious code from the 'cid' parameter and use it directly in SQL queries without appropriate cleaning or validation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nSQL injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nUnauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and service interruption.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe '/pages/transaction.php?cid=2' file is vulnerable. The 'cid' parameter is the entry point for the attack.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nNo login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n*   Input validation and filtering.\n*   Minimize database user permissions.\n*   Regular security audits.\n\n**Payload examples (from the content):**\n\n*   `cid=2' RLIKE (SELECT (CASE WHEN (7957=7957) THEN 2 ELSE 0x28 END))-- SgNo`\n*   `cid=2' OR (SELECT 3508 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x7162707871,(SELECT (ELT(3508=3508,1))),0x717a6b6a71,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a)-- acmT`\n*   `cid=2' AND (SELECT 3813 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))eAIg)-- WElv`",
