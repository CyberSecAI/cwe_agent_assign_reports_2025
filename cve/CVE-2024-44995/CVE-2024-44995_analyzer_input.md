# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-44995

## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net hns3 fix a **deadlock** problem when config TC during resetting When config TC during the reset process, may cause a **deadlock**, the flow is as below pf reset start ...... setup tc DOWN napi_disable() napi_disable()(skip) ...... ...... napi_enable() UINIT netif_napi_del() ...... INIT netif_napi_add() ...... global reset start UP napi_enable()(skip) ...... ......

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **deadlock**
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** net hns3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A deadlock can occur in the hns3 driver when configuring Traffic Control (TC) during a reset process. The race condition happens because the TC setup process can bring the network interface up before the driver's uninitialization (UINIT) routine is complete, leading to a deadlock.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Race condition leading to a deadlock.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "System deadlock, rendering the network interface unusable and potentially disrupting system services relying on network connectivity.",
  "Attack vectors": "Configuring TC (Traffic Control) while a reset of the hns3 network interface is in progress.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to trigger TC configuration and initiate a reset on the hns3 network interface simultaneously."
