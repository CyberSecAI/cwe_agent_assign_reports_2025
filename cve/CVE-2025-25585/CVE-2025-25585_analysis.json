It provides detailed information about an unauthorized administrator password modification vulnerability in the ywoa (Yunwang OA) application. The content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient access control to the `/setup/**` directory.  Specifically, the Spring Security configuration (`com/cloudweb/oa/config/WebSecurityConfig.java:187`) allows any user to access files within this directory.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):**  Any user can access setup files.\n*   **Broken Access Control:** Lack of proper authorization checks for sensitive administrative functions.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAn attacker can reset the database connection address and, consequently, the backend administrator password. This allows for complete compromise of the OA system.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Directly accessing the `/setup/setup.jsp` route via HTTP.\n*   The provided POC is: `http://localhost:8096/oa/setup/setup.jsp`\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Unauthenticated access to the web application. No login is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n*   Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe document does not explicitly state the fix, but it implies that proper access control should be implemented in the Spring Security configuration to restrict access to the `/setup/**` directory to authorized personnel only.  The vulnerability is present in versions before 2024.07.04.",

This leads to CWE-862 [Missing Authorization], as there's no authorization check because there is no authentication. CWE-425 [Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')] is a related CWE, as the lack of authorization allows direct access to restricted URLs.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe425[\"CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe306\n    cwe425 -->|CHILDOF| cwe862\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe862,cwe425 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function], where the `/setup/**` directory lacks any authentication. This leads to CWE-862 [Missing Authorization], as there is no authorization check in place. Finally, CWE-425 [Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')] allows direct access to restricted URLs, leading to the unauthorized modification of administrator passwords.\n- **Root Cause:** CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function]\n- **Weakness:** CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]\n- **Impact:** CWE-425 [Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')] leading to unauthorized modification of administrator passwords.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment focused on the **incorrect access control**, which initially suggested CWE-285 [Improper Authorization]. However, based on the analysis of the provided `gitee.com` content, the root cause is the **lack of authentication** for the `/setup/**` directory. Any user can access the `/setup/setup.jsp` route without logging in. Therefore, CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function] is the primary weakness, followed by CWE-862 [Missing Authorization] and CWE-425 [Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')]. The graph relationships confirm the flow from missing authentication to missing authorization, culminating in direct request. The selection of these CWEs is at the optimal level of specificity. The evidence is strong, primarily based on the `gitee.com` content that explicitly states that the vulnerability stems from insufficient access control to the `/setup/**` directory and allows any user to access files within this directory.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
