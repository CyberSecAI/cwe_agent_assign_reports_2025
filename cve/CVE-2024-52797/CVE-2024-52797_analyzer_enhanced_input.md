## Vulnerability Description
Opencast is free and open source software for automated video capture and distribution. First noticed in Opencast 13 and 14, Opencasts Elasticsearch integration may generate syntactically **invalid Elasticsearch queries** in relation to previously acceptable search queries. From Opencast version 11.4 and newer, Elasticsearch queries are retried a configurable number of times in the case of error to handle temporary losses of connection to Elasticsearch. These invalid queries would fail, causing the retry mechanism to begin requerying with the same syntactically invalid query immediately, in an infinite loop. This causes a massive increase in log size which can in some cases cause a denial of service due to disk exhaustion. Opencast 13.10 and Opencast 14.3 contain patches which address the base issue, with Opencast 16.7 containing changes which harmonize the search behaviour between the admin UI and external API. Users are strongly recommended to upgrade as soon as possible if running versions prior to 13.10 or 14.3. While the relevant endpoints require (by default) `ROLE_ADMIN` or `ROLE_API_SERIES_VIEW`, the problem queries are otherwise innocuous. This issue could be easily triggered by normal administrative work on an affected Opencast system. Those who run a version newer than 13.10 and 14.3 and see different results when searching in their admin UI vs your external API or LMS, may resolve the issue by upgrading to 16.7. No known workarounds for the vulnerability are available.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **component:** Elasticsearch integration

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-52797:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how Opencast's Elasticsearch integration handles user-provided search queries, particularly those coming through external API endpoints.
*   Specifically, certain external API endpoints in Opencast that accept query parameters process these parameters as Elasticsearch queries.
*   Users are not explicitly informed that these parameters are treated as Elasticsearch queries. Consequently, they might input characters that are reserved within Elasticsearch syntax without proper escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Handling:** The application doesn't sanitize or validate user input (specifically, query parameters used in Elasticsearch queries) from external API endpoints.
*   **Infinite Loop:** When an Elasticsearch query contains unescaped reserved characters, it can lead to an `ElasticsearchStatusException`. The retry mechanism, meant for handling temporary connection issues, would then repeatedly retry the same invalid query, causing an infinite loop.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The infinite loop generates a massive amount of log messages. This excessive logging can exhaust the disk space, resulting in a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. The excessive logging, triggered by malformed Elasticsearch queries, fills the disk, making the system unavailable.
*   **Log Spam:** The system logs become excessively verbose, making it harder to identify other potential issues.
*   **Potentially Unexpected Search Results:** Besides the DoS, the use of reserved characters without proper escaping can result in unexpected or incorrect search results for users, although this is less severe compared to the DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is network-based, as it involves sending crafted HTTP requests with malicious query parameters to affected API endpoints.
*   **External API Endpoints:** The vulnerability is triggered through the external API endpoints of Opencast.
*   **Malicious Query Parameters:** The attacker crafts special query parameters with unescaped reserved characters in Elasticsearch syntax.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The vulnerability can be triggered by authenticated users with low privileges (`ROLE_ADMIN` or `ROLE_API_SERIES_VIEW`). Therefore, an attacker needs to be an authenticated user.
*   **Knowledge of Affected Endpoints:** An attacker needs to be aware of the external API endpoints and query parameters that are vulnerable.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the Opencast server with specific parameters.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed in Opencast versions 13.10, 14.3, and a follow-on patch in 16.7.
*   Two pull requests are associated with resolving the issue:
    *   `#5150`: Fixes the infinite loop issue by preventing endless retries of invalid queries.
    *   `#5033`: Sanitizes user input by escaping reserved characters in Elasticsearch queries received from external API endpoints.

**CVE Information:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2024-52797
*   **Severity:** Moderate
*   **CVSS Score:** 6.5
*   **CWE:** CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling)

In summary, this CVE describes a vulnerability where Opencast's improper handling of Elasticsearch queries from external API endpoints could lead to an infinite loop and a denial of service. The fix involves both preventing the infinite loop and sanitizing user-provided input.
