  "description": "ECMA-262 is the language specification for the scripting language ECMAScript. A problem in the ECMAScript (JavaScript) specification of async generators, introduced by a May 2021 spec refactor, may lead to mis-implementation in a way that could present as a security vulnerability, such as **type confusion** and pointer dereference. The internal async generator machinery calls regular promise resolver functions on IteratorResult (`{ done, value }`) objects that it creates, assuming that the IteratorResult objects will not be then-ables. Unfortunately, these IteratorResult objects inherit from `Object.prototype`, so these IteratorResult objects can be made then-able, triggering arbitrary behaviour, including re-entering the async generator machinery in a way that violates some internal invariants. The ECMAScript specification is a living standard and the issue has been addressed at the time of this advisorys public disclosure. JavaScript engine implementors should refer to the latest specification and update their implementations to comply with the `AsyncGenerator` section. ## References - https//github.com/tc39/ecma262/commit/1e24a286d0a327d08e1154926b3ee79820232727 - https//bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1901411 - https//github.com/boa-dev/boa/security/advisories/GHSA-f67q-wr6w-23jq - https//bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=275407 - https//issues.chromium.org/issues/346692561 - https//www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7652",

The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **type confusion** as a root cause.\n\nThe evidence supporting **CWE-843 [Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')]** is the vulnerability description stating that a problem in the ECMAScript specification \"may lead to **type confusion**.\" This aligns directly with the CWE-843 description, where a resource is accessed using an incompatible type.\n\n**CWE-476 [NULL Pointer Dereference]** is considered because the description mentions \"pointer dereference\" as a potential consequence. This could occur if the **type confusion** leads to a pointer being assigned a NULL value and subsequently dereferenced.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause (**type confusion**) and a potential consequence (**NULL pointer dereference**) described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n*   CWE-787, CWE-1333, CWE-1284, CWE-335, CWE-1321 and CWE-1188 were not chosen as they did not accurately reflect the **type confusion** and **pointer dereference** issues described in the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-822 was considered, but **CWE-476 [NULL Pointer Dereference]** was prefered as a more specific potential outcome of the **type confusion**.\n*   CWE-824 was not choosen because the **pointer dereference** was a secondary effect not the primary **rootcause**.",
