# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-11015

## Vulnerability Description
The Sign In With Google plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.0. This is due to the authenticate_user user function **not implementing sufficient null value checks** when setting the access token and user information. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as the first user who has signed in using Google OAuth, which could be the site administrator.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **not implementing sufficient null value checks**
- **impact:** authentication bypass
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **product:** Sign In With Google plugin for WordPress
- **version:** all versions up to and including 1.8.0
- **component:** authenticate_user user function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11015

**Root Cause:** The `authenticate_user` function in the Sign In With Google plugin does not properly check for null values when setting the access token and user information after a user authenticates with Google OAuth.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Improper Authentication:** The core issue is a lack of sufficient null value checks within the `authenticate_user` function. This can lead to an authentication bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An unauthenticated attacker can log in as the first user who has successfully signed in with Google OAuth.
*   This could potentially give an attacker access to an administrator account, depending on who is the first user to sign in through Google.
*   Complete compromise of the site is possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is network-based (AV:N).
*   The attack requires low complexity (AC:L).
*   No privileges are required (PR:N).
*   No user interaction is required (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to trigger the Google OAuth authentication process within the vulnerable plugin.
*   The attacker does not require any pre-existing account or privileges on the target site.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable function is located at `/src/admin/class-sign-in-with-google-admin.php#L525` within the plugin's codebase.
*   The plugin fails to adequately validate the access token and user information, which allows an attacker to potentially hijack the session of the first legitimate user to sign in with Google OAuth.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is rated as critical with a CVSS score of 9.8.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on December 11, 2024.
*   The affected versions are up to and including 1.8.0 of the "Sign In With Google" plugin for WordPress.
*   A patch was not available at the time of the report. Users are advised to either uninstall the plugin or apply other mitigations depending on their risk tolerance.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| No identity check (no login)                               | CWE-306        |
| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
