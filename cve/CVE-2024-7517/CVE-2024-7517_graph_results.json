  "query": "A command injection vulnerability in Brocade Fabric OS before 9.2.0c, and 9.2.1 through 9.2.1a on IP extension platforms could allow a local authenticated attacker to perform a privileged escalation via crafted use of the portcfg command. This specific exploitation is only possible on IP Extension platforms Brocade 7810, Brocade 7840, Brocade 7850 and on Brocade X6 or X7 directors with an SX-6 Extension blade installed. The attacker must be logged into the switch via SSH or serial console to conduct the attack.",
