# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-47736

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved erofs handle overlapped pclusters out of crafted images properly syzbot reported a task hang issue due to a deadlock case where it is waiting for the folio lock of a cached folio that will be used for cache I/Os. After looking into the crafted fuzzed image, I found its formed with several overlapped big pclusters as below Ext logical offset | length physical offset | length 0 0.. 16384 | 16384 151552.. 167936 | 16384 1 16384.. 32768 | 16384 155648.. 172032 | 16384 2 32768.. 49152 | 16384 537223168.. 537239552 | 16384 ... Here, extent 0/1 are physically overlapped although its entirely _impossible_ for normal filesystem images generated by mkfs. First, managed folios containing compressed data will be marked as up-to-date and then unlocked immediately (unlike in-place folios) when compressed I/Os are complete. If physical blocks are not submitted in the incremental order, there should be separate BIOs to avoid dependency issues. However, the current code mis-arranges z_erofs_fill_bio_vec() and BIO submission which causes unexpected BIO waits. Second, managed folios will be connected to their own pclusters for efficient inter-queries. However, this is somewhat hard to implement easily if overlapped big pclusters exist. Again, these only appear in fuzzed images so lets simply fall back to temporary short-lived pages

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-833 | Deadlock | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-667 | Improper Locking | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of the vulnerability description to the definition of CWE-833 (Deadlock). CWE-667 (Improper Locking) was considered as a broader class, as deadlocks are often a consequence of improper locking, making it a potential, though less specific, secondary consideration. The Abstraction levels guided us to select the Base level CWE-833 where possible instead of Class level CWE-667.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **specially crafted erofs image with overlapping physical pclusters**. This leads to **incorrect BIO submission** and **managed folio handling issues**. This incorrect handling results in a **task hang due to deadlock**, which is the final impact. The root cause is the file system's inability to properly manage the overlapping pclusters and thus to manage the locks correctly on the associated folios during I/O operations.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified a **task hang due to deadlock** stemming from the handling of crafted images with overlapped pclusters. The primary CWE identified is CWE-833 (Deadlock), as the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a deadlock condition.

The evidence from the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section supports this: "The vulnerability stems from the way the erofs filesystem handles specially crafted images containing overlapping physical pclusters... This overlap leads to issues in how the filesystem manages cached folios and submits I/O operations, leading to deadlocks."

The retriever results also list CWE-833 as the top candidate.

CWE-667 (Improper Locking) was considered as a secondary CWE because deadlocks are often caused by improper locking mechanisms. However, since the description focuses on the deadlock itself, CWE-833 is the more direct and specific classification.

The selection of CWE-833 as the primary CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the described vulnerability (a deadlock). It is a Base level CWE, which is preferred.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-833: Deadlock
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.
