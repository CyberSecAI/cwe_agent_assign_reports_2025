# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-5276

## Vulnerability Description
A SQL Injection vulnerability in Fortra FileCatalyst Workflow allows an attacker to modify application data. Likely impacts include creation of administrative users and deletion or modification of data in the application database. Data exfiltration via **SQL injection** is not possible using this vulnerability. Successful unauthenticated exploitation requires a Workflow system with anonymous access enabled, otherwise an authenticated user is required. This issue affects all versions of FileCatalyst Workflow from 5.1.6 Build 135 and earlier.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **SQL injection**
- **impact:** Data exfiltration and creation of administrative users and deletion or modification of application data
- **attacker:** unauthenticated attacker
- **product:** Fortra FileCatalyst Workflow
- **version:** 5.1.6 Build 135 and earlier

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5276:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a SQL Injection flaw in Fortra FileCatalyst Workflow. Specifically, user-supplied input (`jobID`) is used to construct SQL queries without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application fails to properly neutralize special elements used in SQL commands, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The application does not adequately validate the user-supplied `jobID` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can modify application data.
*   Potential creation of administrative users.
*   Deletion or modification of data within the application database.
*   Although the advisory states data exfiltration is not possible via this vulnerability, the ability to create admin users and modify data could lead to data compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** The `JOBID` parameter in various URL endpoints of the FileCatalyst Workflow web application is the attack vector.
*   Successful unauthenticated exploitation requires a Workflow system with anonymous access enabled, otherwise, an authenticated user is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable FileCatalyst Workflow instance.
*   For unauthenticated exploitation, anonymous access must be enabled on the targeted system, otherwise, an authenticated user is required.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects FileCatalyst Workflow versions 5.1.6 Build 135 and earlier.
*   A proof-of-concept exploit is provided, demonstrating the ability to add an administrative user by injecting SQL.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Tenable Research.
*   The vendor (Fortra) released a patch in version 5.1.6 Build 139.
*   The CVSS v3.1 base score is 9.8, indicating a critical severity.
* The exploit can be executed using a simple HTTP GET request, adding the malicious sql code in the JOBID parameter of the URL.
