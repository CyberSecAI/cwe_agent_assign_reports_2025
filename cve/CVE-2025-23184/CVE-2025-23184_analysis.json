  "reference_content": "## CVE-2025-23184 Analysis\n\nThe provided content relates to CVE-2025-23184. Here's an extraction of relevant information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from `CachedOutputStream` instances not always being closed, and when backed by temporary files, potentially filling up the file system. Specifically, the `maybeDeleteTempFile` method doesn't always remove the temporary file as intended.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Resource exhaustion (disk space) due to unclosed temporary files.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Denial of Service (DoS) \u2013 the server or client could become unresponsive due to disk space exhaustion.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Processing a large number of requests that trigger the creation of temporary files.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the affected Apache CXF application. No special privileges are required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade to Apache CXF 3.5.10 or later.\n*   Upgrade to Apache CXF 3.6.5 or later.\n*   Upgrade to Apache CXF 4.0.6 or later.\n\n**Affected versions:**\n\n*   Apache CXF before 3.5.10\n*   Apache CXF 3.6.0 before 3.6.5\n*   Apache CXF 4.0.0 before 4.0.6\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The issue is tracked as CXF-7396.\n*   The problem occurs when `streamList.remove(stream)` fails, leading to incorrect checks for empty stream lists.\n*   The issue seems to be exacerbated by processing many large requests in a row.\n*   Attachments to the Jira issue (CXF-7396) contain diagnostic information (HTTP Request.jmx, screenshots).",

CWE-770 is a parent of CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value), but in this case, the resource is disk space via temporary files, not necessarily memory. CWE-770 is also a child of CWE-400, indicating that **allocation of resources without limits** is a common way to achieve resource exhaustion. The creation of temporary files with insecure permissions (CWE-378) is also considered, as insecure permissions on the temporary files could lead to information disclosure but the description focuses on resource exhaustion.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')\"]\n    cwe789[\"CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\"]\n    cwe378[\"CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe789 -->|CHILDOF| cwe770\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe378 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CachedOutputStream instances not being closed**. When these instances are backed by temporary files, this leads to **CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**, specifically the creation of temporary files without proper management. This, in turn, leads to **CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')** as the file system fills up, resulting in a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis considered several CWEs from the retriever results, including CWE-789, CWE-835, and CWE-410. However, CWE-770 best captures the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the **unrestricted allocation of resources** (in this case, disk space via temporary files). The vulnerability description explicitly states that the **CachedOutputStream instances may not be closed and, if backed by temporary files, may fill up the file system**. This directly aligns with CWE-770's description: **\"The product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.\"**\n\nThe impact of filling up the file system leads directly to **CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')**, which is a natural consequence of the **unlimited allocation**.\n\nCWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) was considered because temporary files are allocated. However, the issue is not with the *size* of individual allocations, but the *number* of allocations over time, thus CWE-770 is more appropriate. CWE-835 (Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition) and CWE-410 (Insufficient Resource Pool) do not directly relate to the vulnerability's root cause.\n\nThe relationship graph and vulnerability chain illustrate the progression from the **unmanaged resource allocation** (CWE-770) to the **resource exhaustion** (CWE-400), solidifying the selection of CWE-770 as the primary CWE. The evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE details supports this classification. The selection is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nOpening temporary files without appropriate measures or controls can leave the file, its contents and any function that it impacts vulnerable to attack.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
