The **insecure permissions** on the resource allow unintended actors to access it. |\n| CWE-539 | Use of Persistent Cookies Containing Sensitive Information | 0.60 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The cookies are automatically loaded, suggesting the cookies contain sensitive information that should not be stored persistently. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the decision is the hierarchical structure of CWEs related to permission and privilege management. CWE-732 is a Class-level CWE that encompasses scenarios where permissions for critical resources are incorrectly assigned. The guidance suggests that while the name indicates assignment of permissions for resources, this is often misused for vulnerabilities in which \"permissions\" are not checked, which is an \"authorization\" weakness. However, the vulnerability description clearly states \"**insecure permissions**,\" suggesting that the permissions themselves are the problem, rather than a missing authorization check.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe732[\"CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource\"]\n    cwe539[\"CWE-539: Use of Persistent Cookies Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe277[\"CWE-277: Insecure Inherited Permissions\"]\n    \n    cwe277 -->|CHILDOF| cwe732\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe732 primary\n    class cwe539 secondary\n    class cwe277 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insecure permissions** being set on the Polycom RealPresence Group 500, specifically with automatically loaded cookies.

The key factor in selecting CWE-732 was the explicit mention of \"**insecure permissions**,\" which aligns directly with the CWE's description of incorrectly specified permissions for critical resources. The evidence is primarily based on the vulnerability description itself, and the retriever scores support this selection. A secondary weakness that could be present is the **Use of Persistent Cookies Containing Sensitive Information** since the cookies are automatically loaded.
