This can lead to information disclosure.\n- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a shortcode with specific attributes and adding it to a post, then previewing the post to expose the content of WordPress options.\n- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have at least a contributor role in the WordPress website.\n```",

It is related to CWE-284 **Improper Access Control**, a higher-level Pillar. While more specific Base or Variant CWEs could exist, the provided information focuses on the absence of authorization checks as the core issue. The relationships show that CWE-862 is a child of CWE-284, indicating a hierarchical connection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check (CWE-862) when processing shortcode attributes. This leads to **improper access control** (CWE-284), where users with the contributor role can access sensitive options from the database. The final impact is information disclosure, as arbitrary options are leaked.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-862 **Missing Authorization** as the primary root cause. The vulnerability description and CVE summary clearly state that the plugin does not properly restrict access to its shortcode functionalities, allowing unauthorized users to leak data. The evidence \"The Kadence Blocks Pro plugin does not properly restrict access to its shortcode functionalities, allowing users with at least the contributor role to leak arbitrary options from the database\" supports this. While CWE-284 **Improper Access Control** is a related CWE, it's a higher-level abstraction, and CWE-862 more precisely describes the **missing authorization** check. The retriever results also support this selection, listing CWE-862 as a relevant CWE.\n\nBased on the evidence, relationship analysis, and retriever results, the selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-862 representing the primary weakness and CWE-284 as a related, higher-level classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n*Not Selected:* This is not a CSRF vulnerability.
