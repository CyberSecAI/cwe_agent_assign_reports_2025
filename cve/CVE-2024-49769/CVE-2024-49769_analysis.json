  "description": "Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3. When a remote client closes the connection before waitress has had the opportunity to call getpeername() waitress wont correctly clean up the connection leading to the main thread attempting to write to a socket that no longer exists, but not removing it from the list of sockets to attempt to process. This leads to a busy-loop calling the write function. A remote attacker could run waitress out of available sockets with very little resources required. Waitress 3.0.1 contains fixes that remove the **race condition**.",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe root cause is a race condition during the creation of a new `HTTPChannel`. When a connection is accepted, `waitress` retrieves the remote address. However, it was calling `getpeername()` again, which could fail if the remote client closed the connection before `getpeername()` was called. This failure would set the channel's `connected` attribute to `False` while the socket was still considered writable by the `select` system call, leading to an infinite loop in the `handle_write` method.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Race Condition:** The primary vulnerability is a race condition where a client closing the connection rapidly after the initial connect can cause `getpeername()` to fail, leading to an inconsistent state.\n*   **Inconsistent `connected` state:** The `connected` attribute of the channel was being set based on the result of `getpeername()`, which is unreliable as the connection could have been closed already.\n*   **Incorrect Handling of Disconnected Sockets:** The code was not properly handling the scenario where a socket was considered writable but the connection was effectively closed or half-closed (e.g., shutdown for read).\n*   **Busy Loop:** Due to the inconsistent state, the server would enter a tight loop calling `handle_write` repeatedly, consuming excessive CPU resources.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker could cause a denial of service by sending a crafted request to the server and immediately closing the connection. This would lead to the server consuming 100% CPU on one thread, or possibly running out of available sockets.\n*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The busy loop would cause the server to become unresponsive and consume excessive CPU resources.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network:** The attack is carried out over the network.\n*   The attacker needs to be able to establish a TCP connection to the server.\n*   The attacker needs to be able to close the connection very quickly. This is generally done by sending an invalid request and shutting down the write side of the connection.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server.\n*   **Basic Networking Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to initiate a TCP connection and close the connection quickly.\n*   **Timing:**  The attacker needs to exploit the race condition by closing the connection very quickly after the initial connect, before waitress finishes setting up the channel.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n\n*   The vulnerability was triggered by a specific scenario discovered during pentesting, involving a client that closed the connection very quickly (possibly with a `shutdown` for read) after a connect, causing getpeername to fail, and leading to a busy loop when the server would try to write to a disconnected socket.\n*   The fix involved removing the redundant call to `getpeername()` in `wasyncore.dispatcher`, setting `self.connected = True` during the `HTTPChannel` initialization and modifying the `writable()` method to return `False` when `self.connected` is `False`, preventing the loop.\n*   The vulnerability was present in versions of `waitress` prior to 3.0.1, and fixed in version 3.0.1.\n*   The fix also includes changes to `handle_close()` to prevent calling `close()` on a socket multiple times.\n*   The issue was initially reported as 100% CPU usage due to not closing properly, and was addressed in pull request [#435](https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/435).\n*   The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2024-49769 and GHSA-3f84-rpwh-47g6.",

While it is generally preferred to choose Base or Variant level CWEs, the description of CWE-362 aligns well with the vulnerability description, which highlights a **race condition**. CWE-362 has child relationships with CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition), but the vulnerability described is not a TOCTOU vulnerability. The vulnerability can lead to CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) or CWE-835 (Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('**Infinite Loop**')), as an impact.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe835[\"CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')\"]\n\n    cwe400 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe362\n    cwe835 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe362\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe400,cwe835 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **race condition** (CWE-362) that occurs when the client closes the connection before the server can retrieve the peer name. This leads to an inconsistent state, resulting in a busy loop, which causes uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) or an infinite loop (CWE-835), eventually leading to a denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is primarily due to a **race condition** (CWE-362) where the server attempts to write to a socket that is no longer valid, because the client closed the connection before the server could finish setting up the channel. This leads to a busy loop, consuming excessive CPU resources (CWE-400) or an infinite loop (CWE-835).\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description includes:\n*   \"When a remote client closes the connection before waitress has had the opportunity to call getpeername() waitress wont correctly clean up the connection leading to the main thread attempting to write to a socket that no longer exists\"\n*   \"This leads to a busy-loop calling the write function\"\n*   \"A remote attacker could run waitress out of available sockets with very little resources required.\"\n*   \"Waitress 3.0.1 contains fixes that remove the **race condition**\"\n\nThe retriever results also indicate CWE-362 as the top candidate. The relationship analysis shows that CWE-362 can lead to CWE-400 and CWE-835.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity: CWE-362 captures the root cause of the vulnerability. CWE-400 and CWE-835 describe the impacts of the vulnerability, which are the uncontrolled resource consumption or the **infinite loop**.\n\n**CWEs Considered But Not Used:**\n\n*   CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition): While a **race condition** is present, it's not specifically a TOCTOU vulnerability. The check and use of the socket are not separated in time in the classic TOCTOU sense.\n*   CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference): Not applicable, as the vulnerability doesn't involve NULL pointer dereferences.\n*   CWE-667 (Improper Locking): Not applicable, as the vulnerability is not related to locking mechanisms.\n*   CWE-833 (Deadlock): Not applicable, as the vulnerability does not involve multiple threads waiting for each other.\n*   CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling): While the server runs out of sockets, the root cause is the **race condition** and busy-loop, not the lack of limits or throttling.\n* CWE-404 (Improper Resource Shutdown or Release): This is close, but the **race condition** is a more precise and direct description of the problem.",
