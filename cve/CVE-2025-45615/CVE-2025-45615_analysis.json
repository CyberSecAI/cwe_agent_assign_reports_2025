  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-45615 Content\n\nBased on the provided content, this relates to an **Incorrect Access Control** vulnerability.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the use of `request.getRequestURL()` to obtain the request path in the `QingInterceptor` class's `preHandle` function. This method doesn't parse special characters like \"..\", allowing path traversal.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Path Traversal:** The application is vulnerable to path traversal due to improper input validation of the request URL.\n*   **Authentication Bypass:**  The path traversal allows bypassing the authentication filter.\n*   **Incorrect Access Control:** An attacker can access administrative functionalities without proper authorization.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAn attacker can access `/admin/` API endpoints without authentication, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or performing unauthorized actions. Specifically, the example shows access to any user's information via `/admin/user_info/list_normal.action`.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Crafting a malicious URL containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `/admin/login/../user_info/list_normal.action`).\n*   Directly accessing administrative endpoints by manipulating the URL to bypass the authentication check.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP requests to the application.\n*   No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not provide specific mitigation steps, but it implies that proper input validation and sanitization of the request URL are necessary to prevent path traversal.  Using a more robust method for determining the request path that correctly parses and validates the input would be required.\n\n**More detail than official CVE description:**\n\nYes, the content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It includes:\n\n*   Specific code location (`cn.javaex.yaoqishan.interceptor.QingInterceptor`, `preHandle` function).\n*   Detailed explanation of how the vulnerability works.\n*   A concrete example of a vulnerable URL.\n*   Screenshots demonstrating the vulnerability.\n*   Version and branch information (latest 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT, master).",

CWE-22 is a child of CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path) and has relationships to other CWEs like CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation). CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is a secondary weakness, stemming from the path traversal vulnerability, where administrative functions lack proper authentication.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Path Traversal\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe22 -->|CHILDOF| cwe73\n    cwe306 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe22\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe73,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-22 (**Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**) due to improper input validation of the request URL in `QingInterceptor` which uses `request.getRequestURL()` to obtain the request path, without properly parsing special characters like \"..\".\n2.  **Weakness:** Path traversal allows bypassing authentication checks.\n3.  **Impact:** An attacker can access `/admin/` API endpoints without authentication, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or performing unauthorized actions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **incorrect access control** as the primary issue, but the deeper analysis of the CVE reference content revealed the root cause is a **path traversal** vulnerability. The `QingInterceptor` class's failure to properly handle special characters like \"..\" in the request URL allows attackers to bypass authentication and access administrative functionalities. The primary CWE is therefore CWE-22. CWE-306 is a secondary weakness as critical administrative functions are accessed without proper authentication due to the path traversal. This is based on the evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section, which explicitly mentions path traversal and authentication bypass.\n\nThe provided CWE guidance helped to clarify the distinction between authentication and authorization issues, reinforcing the selection of CWE-22 as the root cause and CWE-306 as a secondary issue. The hierarchical relationships of CWEs also supported this decision, as CWE-22 is a more specific child of CWE-73, indicating a more precise mapping.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
