# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-47059

## Description

When logging in with the correct username and incorrect weak password, the user receives the notification, that their password is too weak. However when an **incorrect username** is provided alongside with a weak password, the application responds with Invalid credentials notification. This difference could be used to perform username enumeration.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Weakness:** incorrect username
- **Impact:** username enumeration
- **Vector:** weak password

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-204 | Observable Response Discrepancy | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE - Root cause of information leakage via differing responses. |
| CWE-203 | Observable Discrepancy | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate - A broader category that encompasses CWE-204 but is less specific. |
| CWE-1390 | Weak Authentication | 0.4 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary candidate - Related to authentication issues, but not the direct cause. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis

The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the parent-child relationship between CWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy) and CWE-204 (Observable Response Discrepancy). CWE-204 is a more specific type of CWE-203, where the discrepancy lies in the response. Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions the application responding with different notifications ("password too weak" vs. "Invalid credentials"), CWE-204 was chosen for its specificity.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain is as follows:

1.  **Root Cause:** **Incorrect** error handling leads to **observable response discrepancy** (CWE-204).
2.  **Impact:** Username enumeration due to the discrepancy in error messages.

The primary weakness is the **incorrect** error handling.

## Summary of Analysis

The analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which clearly states that the application responds differently based on whether a valid or invalid username is provided. The key evidence is the discrepancy in error messages: "password too weak" versus "Invalid credentials". This aligns perfectly with CWE-204 (Observable Response Discrepancy), where the different responses reveal internal state information (whether the username exists or not).

The graph relationships helped refine the selection. While CWE-203 (Observable Discrepancy) is a broader category, CWE-204 is a more specific and accurate fit for this vulnerability. CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) was considered, but it's more related to the weakness of the password itself, not the information leakage due to differing responses.

The selected CWE, CWE-204, is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) because it accurately represents the weakness (observable response discrepancy) without being overly generic (like its parent CWE-203) or focusing on related but distinct issues (like CWE-1390).

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
Two separate operations in a product require different amounts of time to complete, in a way that is observable to an actor and reveals security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

## CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The authentication algorithm is sound, but the implemented mechanism can be bypassed as the result of a separate weakness that is primary to the authentication error.
