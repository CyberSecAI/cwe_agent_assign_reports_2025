# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-47059
## Query
When logging in with the correct username and incorrect weak password, the user receives the notification, that their password is too weak. However when an incorrect username is provided alongside with a weak password, the application responds with Invalid credentials notification. This difference could be used to perform username enumeration.

## Keyphrases
- **weakness**: 'incorrect username'
