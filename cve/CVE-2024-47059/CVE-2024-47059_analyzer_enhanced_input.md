## Vulnerability Description
When logging in with the correct username and incorrect weak password, the user receives the notification, that their password is too weak. However when an **incorrect username** is provided alongside with a weak password, the application responds with Invalid credentials notification. This difference could be used to perform username enumeration.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **incorrect username**
- **impact:** username enumeration
- **vector:** weak password

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from inconsistent error messages during the login process. When a user attempts to log in with a valid username but an incorrect, weak password, the application explicitly states that the password is too weak. However, when an invalid username is provided along with a weak password, the application responds with a generic "Invalid credentials" message. This discrepancy allows an attacker to distinguish between valid and invalid usernames.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Username Enumeration:** The primary weakness is the ability to enumerate valid usernames by observing the different error responses. This is a type of information disclosure.
*   **Inconsistent Error Handling:** The application's inconsistent error messages for different login failures reveal more information than necessary.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can identify valid usernames, which is the first step in potentially more severe attacks like brute-force password cracking or targeted phishing campaigns.
*   **Increased Attack Surface:** Knowing valid usernames makes the system a more attractive target.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is performed over the network by sending login requests with varying usernames and weak passwords.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No privileges required:** The attacker does not need prior access or special permissions.
*   **No user interaction required:** The attack is automated and does not require any user involvement beyond sending the requests.
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Mautic core versions 5.1.0 and higher are affected.
*  **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 5.1.1 and later.
*   **CVSS Score:** A moderate severity score of 5.3 is assigned (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).
