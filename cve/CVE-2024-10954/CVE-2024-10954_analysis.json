  "description": "In the `manim` plugin of binary-husky/gpt_academic, versions prior to the fix, a vulnerability exists due to **improper handling of user-provided prompts**. The root cause is the execution of untrusted code generated by the LLM without a proper sandbox. This allows an attacker to perform remote code execution (RCE) on the app backend server by injecting malicious code through the prompt.",

This suggests a potential path for code injection.

This untrusted code is then executed without a proper sandbox, resulting in remote code execution (RCE).\n\n*   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of user-provided prompts leading to the generation of untrusted code (`CWE-94`).\n*   **Weakness:** Execution of untrusted code without a proper sandbox.\n*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The description clearly states that the **improper handling of user-provided prompts** is the issue. This led to the consideration of CWEs related to input validation and code injection.\n\nThe selection of `CWE-94` as the primary CWE is based on the fact that the LLM generates code that is then executed without proper sanitization or sandboxing. This aligns directly with the description of `CWE-94`: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'). The vulnerability description states: \"The root cause is the execution of untrusted code generated by the LLM without a proper sandbox.\" This directly indicates that the generated code is not being properly controlled, leading to the vulnerability.\n\n`CWE-1427` was considered because the vulnerability involves user-provided prompts being used to influence the behavior of the LLM. However, `CWE-94` was deemed more appropriate as it focuses on the actual generation and execution of the malicious code.\n\n`CWE-20` was also considered but ultimately deemed too generic, as the vulnerability description provides more specific details about the nature of the input handling issue.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the potential for code injection based on the improper handling of user-provided prompts.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause and the immediate consequences of the vulnerability. `CWE-94` captures the essence of the code injection aspect, while `CWE-1427` and `CWE-20` represent contributing factors.",
