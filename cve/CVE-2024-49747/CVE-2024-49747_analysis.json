The **out-of-bounds write** then leads to remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**out of bounds write** due to a **logic error in the code**.\" This directly maps to CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write). While the root cause is a \"**logic error in the code**,\" it could manifest as an incorrect calculation of buffer size, making CWE-131 a relevant secondary consideration.\n\nThe retriever results showed CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size) as a candidate. It is possible that the **logic error** leads to this incorrect calculation and thus leads to the out-of-bounds write.\n\nThe selection is based on the explicit mention of \"out of bounds write,\" making CWE-787 the primary weakness. The possibility of the \"logic error\" leading to incorrect buffer size calculation makes CWE-131 a relevant secondary weakness. The evidence is somewhat limited as the specific logic error is not detailed, leading to a confidence score of 0.7.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
