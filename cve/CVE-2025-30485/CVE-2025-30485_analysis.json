The vulnerability involves **improper symbolic link handling** leading to unauthorized file access. |\n| CWE-59 | Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. This highlights the general weakness of failing to properly prevent a filename from resolving to an unintended resource. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-61, which is a compound weakness related to UNIX symbolic links. CWE-59 is a parent of CWE-61 and represents a more general case of improper link resolution. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions symbolic links and their **improper handling**, thus favoring CWE-61.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe61[\"CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\"]\n    cwe59[\"CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\"]\n\n    cwe61 -->|CHILDOF| cwe59\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe61 primary\n    class cwe59 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper symbolic link handling** (CWE-61), leading to a situation where an attacker can use malicious symbolic links on external storage to **obtain and/or destroy internal files**. The administrative user being logged in is a prerequisite for the attack.\n  - Root Cause: CWE-61\n  - Impact: Unauthorized file access and modification\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which clearly indicates an issue with symbolic link handling. The \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" confirms **improper symbolic link handling** as the root cause. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" reinforces this by stating that \"The routers fail to properly handle symbolic link files\" and \"Improper handling of symbolic link files (CWE-61).\" This direct evidence supports the selection of CWE-61 as the primary CWE.\n\nCWE-59 was considered as a more general case, but CWE-61 is more specific and accurately describes the vulnerability.
