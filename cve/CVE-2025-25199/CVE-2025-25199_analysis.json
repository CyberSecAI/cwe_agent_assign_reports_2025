  "description": "go-crypto-winnative Go crypto backend for Windows using Cryptography API Next Generation (CNG). Prior to commit f49c8e1379ea4b147d5bff1b3be5b0ff45792e41, calls to `cng.TLS1PRF` dont release the key handle, producing a small **memory leak** every time. Commit f49c8e1379ea4b147d5bff1b3be5b0ff45792e41 contains a fix for the issue. The fix is included in versions 1.23.6-2 and 1.22.12-2 of the Microsoft build of go, as well as in the pseudoversion 0.0.0-20250211154640-f49c8e1379ea of the `github.com/microsoft/go-crypto-winnative` Go package.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-25199 based on provided content:\n\nThe provided content is directly related to CVE-2025-25199. It details a memory leak in the `go-crypto-winnative` package. Here's a breakdown of the information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nCalls to `cng.TLS1PRF` did not release the key handle, leading to a memory leak each time the function was called.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Memory Leak: Specifically, a failure to destroy a key handle after use.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   High Availability impact: The CVSS score indicates a high impact on availability due to the memory leak.  Repeated calls to the function could eventually lead to resource exhaustion.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Network: The CVSS vector indicates the vulnerability is exploitable over a network.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   None: No privileges or user interaction are required to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The key handle is now destroyed using `bcrypt.DestroyKey(kh)` after the `bcrypt.GenerateSymmetricKey` call within the `TLS1PRF` function.\n*   Patched versions: 1.23.6-2 and 1.22.12-2.\n*   Affected versions: <= 1.23.6-1 and <= 1.22.12-1\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The commit `f49c8e1` explicitly addresses this issue by adding `defer bcrypt.DestroyKey(kh)` to ensure the key handle is released.\n*   CVSS v3 base metrics are provided: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\n*   The vulnerability was reported by clarkb7.\n*   The affected package is `github.com/microsoft/go-crypto-winnative`.",

The code **doesn't release the key handle**, causing a **memory leak**. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE, CWE-401, is a Variant of higher-level Class CWE-772 (Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime), indicating a more specific type of resource management issue. No further chain relationships are relevant in this case.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    cwe772[\"CWE-772: Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    \n    cwe401 -->|CHILDOF| cwe772\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe401 primary\n    class cwe772 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single step:\n1.  **Root Cause:** Failure to release the key handle after use (`cng.TLS1PRF` **doesn't release the key handle**).\n2.  **Impact:** Resulting **memory leak**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is strongly based on the provided evidence, particularly the vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The root cause is clearly identified as the failure to release the key handle, leading directly to a memory leak.\n\n*   **Evidence:** The vulnerability description explicitly states that calls to `cng.TLS1PRF` **don't release the key handle**, producing a **memory leak**.\n*   **Justification:** CWE-401 directly addresses the scenario where memory is not released after its effective lifetime, which perfectly matches the vulnerability description. The fix involves explicitly destroying the key handle, further solidifying this classification.\n\nThe selection of CWE-401 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it is a Variant-level CWE that accurately captures the nature of the memory leak.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* This CWE is not related to memory leaks but rather to uninitialized pointers.\n\n## CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* This CWE is not relevant because the vulnerability is a memory leak, not a null pointer dereference.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
