# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-39810
## Query
Mattermost versions 9.5.x <= 9.5.7 and 9.10.x <= 9.10.0 fail to time limit and size limit the CA path file in the ElasticSearch configuration which allows a System Role with access to the Elasticsearch system console to add any file as a CA path field, such as /dev/zero and, after testing the connection, cause the application to crash.

## Keyphrases
- **weakness**: 'fail to time limit', 'size limit the CA path file'
