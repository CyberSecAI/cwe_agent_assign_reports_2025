### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** significant memory consumption
- **product:** Django
- **version:** 5.0 before 5.0.8, 4.2 before 4.2.15
- **component:** floatformat template filter

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-41989:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `floatformat` template filter in `django.utils.numberformat` is susceptible to excessive memory consumption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Exhaustion:** The `floatformat` filter doesn't properly handle extremely large exponents in scientific notation when processing string representations of numbers. This can lead to a memory exhaustion attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a server to run out of memory, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker can provide a crafted string representation of a number in scientific notation with a large exponent as input to the `floatformat` template filter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to supply input that is processed by the vulnerable template filter. This could be done through user-submitted data, data read from a database or any other method that passes data into a Django template.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "moderate" severity according to the Django security policy.
*   Patches are available for Django versions 5.0, 4.2, and the main branch.
