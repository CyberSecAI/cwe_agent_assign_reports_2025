# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-5700

# Vulnerability Description

    Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 126, Firefox ESR 115.11, and Thunderbird 115.11. Some of these bugs showed evidence of **memory corruption** and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 127, Firefox ESR < 115.12, and Thunderbird < 115.12.

    ## WEAKNESS: 'memory corruption'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write (Score: 608.69)

The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....

### 2. CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation (Score: 441.97)

The product performs a calculation that generates incorrect or unintended results that are later used in security-critical decisions or resource management....

### 3. CWE-416: Use After Free (Score: 326.65)

The product reuses or references memory after it has been freed. At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer vali...

### 4. CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable (Score: 318.71)

The code uses a variable that has not been initialized, leading to unpredictable or unintended results....

### 5. CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow') (Score: 315.55)

The product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer....
