## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **deserialization** of untrusted data, leading directly to potential code execution or other security impacts, depending on the deserialization context.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly states that the **root cause** is **deserialization** due to the manipulation of the `dataFile` argument.

The key phrase "manipulation of the argument dataFile leads to **deserialization**" directly supports the selection of **CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data**.

The Retriever Results also list **CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data** as a potential match.

I considered other CWEs from the Retriever Results, but they were not as directly relevant as **CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data**, as they focused on the consequences of the **deserialization** rather than the root cause.

The selection of **CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data** is at the optimal level of specificity, as it accurately captures the **root cause** of the vulnerability.
