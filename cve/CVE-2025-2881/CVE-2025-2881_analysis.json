CWE-497, \"Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\" is a potential child of CWE-200 and was considered. The other candidate, CWE-306, represents a missing authentication issue, which could be a contributing factor, but the primary issue is that the information is exposed.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe497 -->|CHILDOF| cwe200\n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe497,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the presence of a `phpinfo.php` script that is publicly accessible. This script exposes sensitive information, leading to the impact of sensitive information exposure. The **root cause** is the **unprotected exposure** of the `phpinfo.php` script. The lack of authentication may or may not be considered part of the chain depending on the intended use case.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is primarily an **information disclosure** issue due to a publicly accessible `phpinfo.php` script, allowing **unauthenticated attackers** to **view potentially sensitive information**. The primary CWE is CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor), because it directly addresses the **information disclosure** aspect. While CWE-200 is discouraged, it is applicable given the lack of a more precise CWE for the specific scenario. CWE-497 is included as a secondary candidate since it is a child of CWE-200 and is more specific. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is also considered as a secondary candidate, however, it is only relevant if the intended use of the `phpinfo.php` script required authentication. The evidence supports CWE-200 as the primary weakness, with CWE-497 and CWE-306 as potential contributing factors.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not considered* because while related to accessibility, it isn't the root problem, which is the information is exposed.\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n*Not considered* because it is not relevant to information exposure\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not considered* as the sensitive information is generated by the phpinfo() function.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not considered* as it is not relevant to the phpinfo() function.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Considered as a secondary candidate* since the `phpinfo()` function does expose system information.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
