  "query": "An Improper Handling of Additional Special Element vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MS-MPC, MS-MIC and SPC3, and SRX Series, allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS). If the SIP ALG processes specifically formatted SIP invites, a memory corruption will occur which will lead to a crash of the FPC processing these packets. Although the system will automatically recover with the restart of the FPC, subsequent SIP invites will cause the crash again and lead to a sustained DoS. This issue affects Junos OS on MX Series and SRX Series * all versions before 21.2R3-S9, * 21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S10, * 22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S6, * 22.4 versions before 22.4R3-S5, * 23.2 versions before 23.2R2-S3, * 23.4 versions before 23.4R2-S3, * 24.2 versions before 24.2R1-S2, 24.2R2.",
