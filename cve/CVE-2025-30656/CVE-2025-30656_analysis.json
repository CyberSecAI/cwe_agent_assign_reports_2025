  "description": "An **Improper Handling of Additional Special Element** vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MS-MPC, MS-MIC and SPC3, and SRX Series, allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS). If the SIP ALG processes specifically formatted SIP invites, a **memory corruption** will occur which will lead to a crash of the FPC processing these packets. Although the system will automatically recover with the restart of the FPC, subsequent SIP invites will cause the crash again and lead to a sustained DoS. This issue affects Junos OS on MX Series and SRX Series * all versions before 21.2R3-S9, * 21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S10, * 22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S6, * 22.4 versions before 22.4R3-S5, * 23.2 versions before 23.2R2-S3, * 23.4 versions before 23.4R2-S3, * 24.2 versions before 24.2R1-S2, 24.2R2.",

CWE-787 is a specific type of CWE-119. Since the vulnerability description indicates a **memory corruption** caused by **improper handling of additional special elements**, leading to a crash, CWE-787 is the more specific and accurate choice. CWE-400 (**Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**) is a class-level CWE and is less specific than CWE-787.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe400 -->|CHILDOF| cwe703\n    cwe703[\"CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    cwe703 -->|CHILDOF| cwe755\n    cwe755[\"CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    cwe400 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe755\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of additional special elements** in SIP invites, leading to **memory corruption**, which then causes the FPC to crash, resulting in a Denial of Service.\n  - **Root Cause:** **Improper Handling of Additional Special Element** (Implicit, no direct CWE)\n  - **Weakness:** CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**)\n  - **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).

This corruption leads to the FPC crashing. The description states that the system will automatically recover with the restart of the FPC, but subsequent SIP invites will cause the crash again and lead to a sustained DoS, suggesting uncontrolled resource consumption. CWE-400 (**Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**) is added as a secondary weakness to capture the resource exhaustion aspect of the sustained DoS.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**) as the top candidate.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs multiple related behaviors, but the behaviors are performed in the wrong order in ways which may produce resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
