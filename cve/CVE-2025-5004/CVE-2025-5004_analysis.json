The attacker injects malicious code from the parameter 'c' and uses it directly in SQL queries without appropriate cleaning or validation.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.\n*   **Attack vectors:** Injecting malicious SQL queries through the 'c' parameter.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the `/admin/add_course.php` file and inject malicious SQL code into the 'c' parameter. No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:**\n    *   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n    *   Input validation and filtering.\n    *   Minimize database user permissions.\n    *   Regular security audits.",

While other CWEs like CWE-79 (Cross-Site Scripting) and CWE-434 (Unrestricted File Upload) were considered, they did not align with the core issue of **SQL Injection**. The base level of CWE-89 is appropriate as it directly describes the **improper neutralization** leading to the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain for this scenario is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper Neutralization** of special elements in SQL commands (CWE-89).\n2.  **Impact:** **SQL Injection**, leading to unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the clear description of an **SQL Injection** vulnerability.
