CWE-284 is a higher-level category, while CWE-862 and CWE-863 are more specific classes of authorization issues. Given the vulnerability description, **Improper Access Control** is explicitly stated as the root cause. While the specific type of access control issue (missing or incorrect authorization) is not fully detailed, both are considered. Since the description states \"*Improper Access Control* vulnerability that could result in a Security feature bypass. A low-privileged attacker could leverage this vulnerability to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized read access\", it's reasonable to consider the more specific authorization issues.

The description explicitly mentions **\"Improper Access Control\"**, which immediately points to CWE-284. However, the description also indicates that this **Improper Access Control** leads to a security feature bypass and unauthorized read access, suggesting that the access control issue might be related to authorization.\n\nThe Retriever Results and Complete CWE Specifications were then analyzed to refine the classification. CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) were considered as potential candidates due to their relationship to authorization and their appearance in the Retriever Results.\n\nThe Mapping Guidance for Authentication vs. Authorization vs. Access Control further clarified the distinctions between these concepts. Given that the vulnerability results in unauthorized read access, it is plausible that either authorization is missing or is incorrectly implemented.\n\nThe decision to include both CWE-862 and CWE-863 as secondary CWEs acknowledges the possibility of either missing or incorrect authorization, while CWE-284 remains the primary CWE because it is the explicitly stated **rootcause**. This approach aims to capture the nuances of the vulnerability while adhering to the principle of selecting the most specific applicable CWEs.\n\nThe evidence for CWE-284 is the explicit mention of **\"Improper Access Control\"** in the Vulnerability Description Key Phrases. The evidence for CWE-862 and CWE-863 is the resulting \"unauthorized read access\", implying a flaw in authorization.\n\nUltimately, the selected CWEs represent the optimal level of specificity given the available evidence.
