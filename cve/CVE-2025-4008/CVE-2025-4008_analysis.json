User-controlled input from `$QUERY_STRING` is parsed and used unsanitized in an `eval` call.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Command Injection\n*   Authentication Bypass (due to the CGI script being accessible in an unprotected directory - \"public\")\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Remote unauthenticated attackers can gain arbitrary command execution with root privileges on affected devices.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Network-accessible web interface (Internet exposure is a precondition).\n*   HTTP GET request to `/cgi-bin/template.cgi` with a malicious `templatefile` parameter.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   No authentication required.\n*   Network access to the Meteobridge device.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade to version 6.2 or later.\n*   Avoid exposing the Meteobridge to the Internet. Operate it within a LAN only, without remote access.\n\n**Additional details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **Affected versions:** <= 6.1\n*   **CVSS Score:** 8.7 (High) - CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N\n*   The vulnerability was discovered through automated bash static code analysis performed by ONEKEY.\n*   Timeline of disclosure is provided, including attempts to contact the vendor and notification to the German BSI.\n*   Proof of concept examples (curl commands) are provided.\n*   Devices are reportedly visible on Shodan, indicating potential internet exposure.",

CWE-306 exists as a separate, but related, vulnerability. While command injection is the primary root cause, the lack of authentication allows unauthenticated attackers to exploit it. This highlights a potential chain where missing authentication can lead to command injection. The abstraction levels influenced the decision to prioritize the class-level CWE-77, because it directly represents the type of injection, while CWE-306 at the Base level identifies the authentication issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe77\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe77 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing authentication (CWE-306)** which allows an unauthenticated attacker to access an endpoint. The endpoint is vulnerable to **command injection (CWE-77)** due to **insecure use of eval calls** with unsanitized user-controlled input. The final impact is **arbitrary command execution with root privileges**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which is strong. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" clearly states the root cause as \"**insecure use of eval calls**\" and the vulnerability as \"**command injection**\". This aligns perfectly with CWE-77. The summary also mentions \"**Authentication Bypass**\", which maps to CWE-306. The graph relationships influenced the decision to include both CWE-77 and CWE-306. CWE-77 represents the direct vulnerability, while CWE-306 represents a prerequisite that enables the vulnerability to be exploited by remote unauthenticated attackers. CWE-77 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the command injection, whereas moving to CWE-78 is too specific because it implies this is only in an OS command when the vulnerability description does not state that.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\n**CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')** is the primary CWE because the root cause is the **insecure use of eval calls** which is a form of **command injection** and this is in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" as a **weakness**.\n*   **CWE-77** (Confidence: 1.0)\n    *   **Technical Explanation:** The vulnerability description clearly states that the Meteobridge web interface is vulnerable to **command injection**. The provided \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms this by stating the \"**Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure use of `eval` calls in the `template.cgi` script.
