While the description indicates a **logic error** leading to a denial of service, the specifics are vague. CWE-400 serves as a high-level classification that encompasses various resource consumption issues leading to DoS. The retriever results included some potentially related CWEs, but none provided a strong direct fit given the limited information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe400 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively simple based on the information available:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Logic error in the code** (unspecified)\n2.  **Weakness:** Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\n3.  **Impact:** Denial of Service\n\nDue to the lack of specificity in the vulnerability description, it is hard to identify a more precise chain.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment was challenging due to the limited details in the vulnerability description. The key phrase \"logic error\" points to a potential underlying flaw in the code. However, the resulting impact of \"denial of service\" is more clearly articulated. Given this information, CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is chosen as the most appropriate high-level classification.\n\nThe decision is based on the evidence that the **logic error** leads to a denial of service, indicating a resource consumption issue.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
