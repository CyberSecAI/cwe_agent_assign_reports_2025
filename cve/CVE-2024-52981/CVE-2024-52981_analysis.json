Although the description also mentions stack overflow, the root cause is the uncontrolled recursion, which leads to the stack overflow. CWE-400 is a parent of CWE-674, thus less specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe674[\"CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe674 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe674 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **uncontrolled recursion** (**CWE-674**), leading to excessive resource consumption and ultimately a stack overflow.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description which highlights the **large recursion** as the root cause. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" reinforces this by stating \"A **large recursion** using the Well-KnownText formatted string with nested GeometryCollection objects could cause a stackoverflow.\" This evidence directly supports the selection of **CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion)** as the primary weakness. While a stack overflow is the symptom, the underlying problem is the uncontrolled recursion.\n\nThe graph relationships helped to clarify the level of specificity. **CWE-674** is a child of **CWE-400**, making it a more precise choice for the identified weakness. **CWE-674** is at the Class level, and the guidance suggests looking for a more specific Base level, but none were found in the provided information. Therefore, **CWE-674** is the optimal choice.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-776: Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses XML documents and allows their structure to be defined with a Document Type Definition (DTD), but it does not properly control the number of recursive definitions of entities.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
