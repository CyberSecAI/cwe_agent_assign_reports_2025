## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
**Relevant Information from github.com_bcf4fc45_20250624_201230.html:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the '/admin/finished.php' file of the 'Restaurant Management System System' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter 'id' and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation. This allows attackers to forge input values, thereby manipulating SQL queries and performing unauthorized operations.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability. The vulnerability exists in the '/admin/finished.php' file. The 'id' parameter is vulnerable.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption, posing a serious threat to system security and business continuity.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious SQL queries into the 'id' parameter via a POST request.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the '/admin/finished.php' file with a crafted 'id' parameter. No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation or fix:**
    1.  Use prepared statements and parameter binding.
    2.  Input validation and filtering.
    3.  Minimize database user permissions.
    4.  Regular security audits.
