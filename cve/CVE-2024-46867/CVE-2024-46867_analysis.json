  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved drm/xe/client fix deadlock in show_meminfo() There is a real deadlock as well as sleeping in atomic() bug in here, if the bo put happens to be the last ref, since bo destruction wants to grab the same spinlock and sleeping locks. Fix that by dropping the ref using xe_bo_put_deferred(), and moving the final commit outside of the lock. Dropping the lock around the put is tricky since the bo can go out of scope and delete itself from the list, making it difficult to navigate to the next list entry. (cherry picked from commit 0083b8e6f11d7662283a267d4ce7c966812ffd8a)",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- The vulnerability stems from a deadlock and potential \"sleeping in atomic context\" issue within the `show_meminfo()` function of the `xe_drm_client.c` driver.\n- The `show_meminfo()` function iterates through a list of buffer objects (BOs) associated with a client. It acquires a spinlock (`client->bos_lock`) to protect the list during this iteration.\n- The `xe_bo_put(bo)` function, used to decrement the reference count of each BO, can trigger the destruction of the BO if it's the last reference.\n- The BO destruction process needs to acquire the same spinlock held by `show_meminfo()`, leading to a deadlock if `xe_bo_put()` triggers destruction.\n- Additionally, the BO destruction process might also involve sleeping locks, which is problematic within an atomic context.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Deadlock:** The primary vulnerability is a deadlock condition where `show_meminfo()` holds a spinlock while trying to decrement the reference count on a BO, and the BO's destruction tries to acquire the same lock, causing the system to hang.\n- **Sleeping in Atomic Context:** The BO destruction path may involve operations that cause the calling thread to sleep, which is illegal within an atomic context protected by a spinlock.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- The deadlock can cause a denial of service (DoS) by freezing the affected system. The system will be unresponsive until rebooted.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- An attacker does not need any special privileges to trigger this bug.\n- The vulnerability can be triggered by calling the `show_meminfo()` function, which is used to collect and display memory usage information for the xe driver. This function is called when information about the driver is requested.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the `show_meminfo()` function which is part of the debug functionality. The `xe` driver must be loaded and active on the system to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n**Mitigation:**\n- The patch introduces the following changes:\n  - Instead of calling `xe_bo_put()` directly within the loop, it uses `xe_bo_put_deferred(bo, &deferred)`. This function defers the actual decrement of the reference count and potential BO destruction.\n  - The reference count decrement and potential destruction of the buffer objects are moved outside of the spinlock using `xe_bo_put_commit(&deferred)`.\n  - This prevents the deadlock because the BO destruction will not attempt to reacquire the lock that is already held by `show_meminfo`.\n\nIn summary, this vulnerability is a deadlock in the xe graphics driver when collecting memory info due to incorrect locking during BO destruction.",

CWE-833 is more specific and accurately describes the deadlock condition detailed in the vulnerability. While CWE-667 is related as it describes the underlying cause (improper locking), it's less precise than CWE-833.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe833[\"CWE-833: Deadlock\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n\n    cwe833 -->|CHILDOF| cwe667\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe833 primary\n    class cwe667 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with improper locking, leading to a deadlock:\n1.  **Improper Locking (CWE-667):** The code fails to properly acquire or release a lock.\n2.  **Deadlock (CWE-833):** Multiple threads or executable segments wait for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in a deadlock.\n    -   CWE-833 is the root cause and impact in this scenario.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identifies the **deadlock** as the primary issue stemming from **improper locking**. The provided evidence strongly supports this, particularly the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which explicitly mentions the deadlock condition and the locking issues.\n\nThe graph relationships confirm that CWE-833 is a child of CWE-667, making it a more specific and appropriate choice for this vulnerability. The selection of CWE-833 is at the optimal level of specificity because the vulnerability description clearly indicates a deadlock situation.\n\nThe evidence that supports this is:\n*   \"**rootcause: deadlock and sleeping in atomic() bug**\"\n*   \"**Deadlock:** The primary vulnerability is a deadlock condition where `show_meminfo()` holds a spinlock while trying to decrement the reference count on a BO, and the BO's destruction tries to acquire the same lock, causing the system to hang.\"\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-833: Deadlock\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
