  "description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) IPv4 access control list (ACL) feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform SNMP polling of an affected device, even if it is configured to deny SNMP traffic.&nbsp This vulnerability exists because **Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software do not support extended IPv4 ACLs for SNMP**, but they do allow administrators to configure extended named IPv4 ACLs that are attached to the SNMP server configuration without a warning message. This can result in no ACL being applied to the SNMP listening process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing SNMP polling of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform SNMP operations that should be denied. The attacker has no control of the SNMP ACL configuration and would still need a valid SNMP version 2c (SNMPv2c) community string or SNMP version 3 (SNMPv3) user credentials. SNMP with IPv6 ACL configurations is not affected. For more information, see the section of this advisory.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-20373:\n\n**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**\n\n   The provided content directly relates to **CVE-2024-20373**. The advisory title \"Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software SNMP Extended Named Access Control List Bypass Vulnerability\", along with the included CVE ID, confirms its relevance.\n\n**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n   - The vulnerability stems from the fact that Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software do not properly enforce IPv4 Access Control Lists (ACLs) for SNMP.\n   - Specifically, while they accept configurations that attach extended *named* IPv4 ACLs to the SNMP server settings, these extended ACLs are *not actually applied* to the SNMP listening process. This allows traffic that should be blocked by the ACL to bypass the configured restrictions. The system only supports standard ACLs and not extended ACLs, even if there's no warning message when configuring it.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n   - **Incorrect ACL Handling:** The primary weakness is the software's failure to process extended named IPv4 ACLs, even though the software allows the user to configure and associate them with the SNMP process.\n   - **Lack of Warning/Enforcement:** There's also a weakness in that the system doesn't notify administrators that extended ACLs are not supported, which can mislead them to think they are properly securing the device.\n   - **Configuration Persistence Issues**: When upgrading or downgrading software versions, if an extended named ACL is configured, it's silently removed from the configuration upon rebooting.\n\n**4. Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n   - An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass the configured ACL restrictions.\n   - This allows them to perform SNMP polling of the device, even if SNMP traffic should be denied according to the extended ACL.\n   - A successful exploit allows the attacker to perform unauthorized SNMP operations.\n   - **Note:** Attackers still require valid SNMPv2c community strings or SNMPv3 credentials. The vulnerability only bypasses the ACL access control list.\n\n**5. Attack Vectors:**\n\n   - The attack vector is remote and network-based.\n   - An attacker would send SNMP polling requests to the device.\n\n**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n   - The attacker must be able to reach the targeted device over the network.\n   - The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the ACL bypass.\n   -  The attacker must have a valid SNMP community string (for v2c) or SNMPv3 user credentials to execute SNMP operations.\n\n**Additional details from the content that enhances the CVE Description:**\n\n*   **Specific ACL Types:** The document clearly differentiates between standard (numbered or named) and extended (numbered or named) IPv4 ACLs, clarifying the vulnerability\u2019s limitations to extended ACLs.\n*   **Scenarios of Vulnerability:** It outlines two specific scenarios of how the vulnerability occurs, during configuration with affected versions, and while upgrading from or downgrading to an affected version.\n*   **Workaround Details:** The document specifies that the workaround involves converting extended named ACLs to standard named ACLs, as well as applying this workaround before upgrades to avoid issues after upgrading to a fixed release that prevents the use of extended named ACLs.\n*   **Affected Products:** Only Cisco IOS and IOS XE software is affected.\n*   **Configuration Verification**: Includes the precise steps to verify if a device is vulnerable, using specific `show` commands to identify the presence of extended named ACLs.\n*   **No Public Exploitation**:  Notes that at the time of publication, there were no known public exploits.",

This leads to a bypass of intended access restrictions, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to perform unauthorized SNMP polling. The chain can be summarized as:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Incorrect ACL Handling** (implied by CWE-863)\n2.  **Weakness:** **Incorrect Authorization** (CWE-863)\n3.  **Impact:** SNMP polling of the device, even if SNMP traffic should be denied.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on the vulnerability description and CVE reference summary, highlighting the root cause as the system's failure to properly enforce extended IPv4 ACLs for SNMP, leading to an access control bypass. The Retriever results and CWE specifications were then reviewed to identify the most appropriate CWE.\n\nThe vulnerability description indicates that **Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software do not support extended IPv4 ACLs for SNMP**, but allow administrators to configure them without warning. This results in the configured ACL not being applied to the SNMP listening process, allowing unauthorized SNMP operations if the attacker has the correct community string or SNMPv3 credentials.\n\nThe primary CWE selected is **CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization)** because the software *attempts* to perform access control via ACLs, but the implementation is flawed, resulting in a bypass.\n\nCWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) was considered, but the vulnerability is not a complete lack of authentication; it's an **incorrect authorization** because the ACL mechanism is present but not functioning as intended.\n\nThe selection of CWE-863 is at the optimal level of specificity because it accurately reflects the core issue: the authorization mechanism is present but flawed. Using a higher-level CWE like CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) would be too generic and would not capture the specific nature of the **incorrect authorization** vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 2353.74\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 2196.16\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
