This is a classic ABBA deadlock. To fix the deadlock,make sure we dont try to acquire disk->open_mutex after freezingthe queue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Deadlock between sd_remove and sd_release due to incorrect mutex acquisition order after queue freezing.**
- **weakness:** **Incorrect locking order in the SCSI driver, specifically attempting to acquire the disk->open_mutex after the queue has been frozen.**
- **impact:** System hang due to a deadlock, preventing further operation.
- **vector:** Concurrent execution of sd_remove and sd_release operations on a SCSI device.
- **product:** Linux Kernel
- **version:** All versions affected until the fix is applied
- **component:** SCSI Driver

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2024-42294.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a deadlock between the `sd_remove` and `sd_release` functions in the Linux kernel's block device handling. This occurs because `sd_remove` attempts to freeze the block device queue and then acquire the disk's `open_mutex`, while `sd_release` can also attempt to acquire the same mutex after having already entered the queue freeze process. The SCSI driver does not set the `GD_OWNS_QUEUE` flag, thus not setting `QUEUE_FLAG_DYING`, creating a classic ABBA deadlock scenario.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Deadlock:**  A classic ABBA deadlock occurs due to the incorrect ordering of mutex acquisition and queue freezing between `sd_remove` and `sd_release`.
- **Race Condition:** The timing of `sd_remove` and `sd_release` executing concurrently on the same disk leads to the deadlock.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **System Hang:** The deadlock results in hung tasks, causing the system to become unresponsive, as demonstrated by the provided kernel logs with blocked tasks.
- **Denial of Service:** The hung tasks effectively create a denial-of-service condition, preventing the system from functioning correctly.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering the `sd_remove` path while also having an active process executing `sd_release` on the same device.
- Specifically, the scenario involves the removal of a SCSI block device (likely USB storage) while an `fsck` process holds an open file descriptor for that device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to trigger the removal of a SCSI device, typically a USB storage device.
- The attacker also needs a process like `fsck` to be using the device, thus triggering the `sd_release` path when the device removal occurs.
-  No special privileges are explicitly mentioned in the provided text, but the ability to interact with storage devices is needed.
