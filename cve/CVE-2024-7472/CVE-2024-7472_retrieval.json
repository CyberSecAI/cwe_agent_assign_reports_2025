Custom Product Tabs for WooCommerce plugin <= 1.7.7 at WordPress leading to &yikes-the-content-toggle option update. \n\n- CVE-2021-36369: An issue was discovered in Dropbear through 2020.81. Due to a non-RFC-compliant check of the available authentication methods in the client-side SSH code, it is possible for an SSH server to change the login process in its favor. This attack can bypass additional security measures such as FIDO2 tokens or SSH-Askpass. Thus, it allows an attacker to abuse a forwarded agent for logging on to another server unnoticed.\n\n- CVE-2021-3827: A flaw was found in keycloak, where the default ECP binding flow allows other authentication flows to be bypassed. By exploiting this behavior, an attacker can bypass the MFA authentication by sending a SOAP request with an AuthnRequest and Authorization header with the user's credentials. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-41638: The authentication checks of the MELAG FTP Server in version 2.2.0.4 are incomplete, which allows a remote attacker to access local files only by using a valid username.\n\n- CVE-2022-0910: A downgrade from two-factor authentication to one-factor authentication vulnerability in the CGI program of Zyxel USG/ZyWALL series firmware versions 4.32 through 4.71, USG FLEX series firmware versions 4.50 through 5.21, ATP series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.21, and VPN series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.21, that could allow an authenticated attacker to bypass the second authentication phase to connect the IPsec VPN server even though the two-factor authentication (2FA) was enabled.\n\n- CVE-2022-1049: A flaw was found in the Pacemaker configuration tool (pcs). The pcs daemon was allowing expired accounts, and accounts with expired passwords to login when using PAM authentication. Therefore, unprivileged expired accounts that have been denied access could still login.\n\n- CVE-2022-1426: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 12.6 before 14.8.6, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.4, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.1. GitLab was not correctly authenticating a user that had some certain amount of information which allowed an user to authenticate without a personal access token.\n\n- CVE-2022-1955: Session 1.13.0 allows an attacker with physical access to the victim's device to bypass the application's password/pin lock to access user data. This is possible due to lack of adequate security controls to prevent dynamic code manipulation.\n\n- CVE-2022-20662: A vulnerability in the smart card login authentication of Cisco Duo for macOS could allow an unauthenticated attacker with physical access to bypass authentication. This vulnerability exists because the assigned user of a smart card is not properly matched with the authenticating user. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by configuring a smart card login to bypass Duo authentication. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use any personal identity verification (PIV) smart card for authentication, even if the smart card is not assigned to the authenticating user.\n\n- CVE-2022-22956: VMware Workspace ONE Access has two authentication bypass vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-22955 & CVE-2022-22956) in the OAuth2 ACS framework. A malicious actor may bypass the authentication mechanism and execute any operation due to exposed endpoints in the authentication framework.\n\n- CVE-2022-23501: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. In versions prior to 8.7.49, 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1 TYPO3 is vulnerable to Improper Authentication. Restricting frontend login to specific users, organized in different storage folders (partitions), can be bypassed. A potential attacker might use this ambiguity in usernames to get access to a different account - however, credentials must be known to the adversary. This issue is patched in versions 8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23600: fleet is an open source device management, built on osquery. Versions prior to 4.9.1 expose a limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with missing audience verification. This impacts deployments using SAML SSO in two specific cases: 1. A malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) could reuse the SAML response to log into Fleet as a user -- only if the user has an account with the same email in Fleet, _and_ the user signs into the malicious SP via SAML SSO from the same Identity Provider (IdP) configured with Fleet. 2. A user with an account in Fleet could reuse a SAML response intended for another SP to log into Fleet. This is only a concern if the user is blocked from Fleet in the IdP, but continues to have an account in Fleet. If the user is blocked from the IdP entirely, this cannot be exploited. Fleet 4.9.1 resolves this issue. Users unable to upgrade should: Reduce the length of sessions on your IdP to reduce the window for malicious re-use, Limit the amount of SAML Service Providers/Applications used by user accounts with access to Fleet, and When removing access to Fleet in the IdP, delete the Fleet user from Fleet as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24259: An incorrect check in the component cdr.php of Voipmonitor GUI before v24.96 allows unauthenticated attackers to escalate privileges via a crafted request.\n\n- CVE-2022-24883: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Prior to version 2.7.0, server side authentication against a `SAM` file might be successful for invalid credentials if the server has configured an invalid `SAM` file path. FreeRDP based clients are not affected. RDP server implementations using FreeRDP to authenticate against a `SAM` file are affected. Version 2.7.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, use custom authentication via `HashCallback` and/or ensure the `SAM` database path configured is valid and the application has file handles left.\n\n- CVE-2022-24885: Nextcloud Android app is the Android client for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to version 3.19.1, users can bypass a lock on the Nextcloud app on an Android device by repeatedly reopening the app. Version 3.19.1 contains a fix for the problem. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24976: Atheme IRC Services before 7.2.12, when used in conjunction with InspIRCd, allows authentication bypass by ending an IRC handshake at a certain point during a challenge-response login sequence.\n\n- CVE-2022-2533: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 12.10 before 15.1.6, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.4, all versions starting from 15.3 before 15.3.2. GitLab was not performing correct authentication with some Package Registries when IP address restrictions were configured, allowing an attacker already in possession of a valid Deploy Token to misuse it from any location.\n\n- CVE-2022-2553: The authfile directive in the booth config file is ignored, preventing use of authentication in communications from node to node. As a result, nodes that do not have the correct authentication key are not prevented from communicating with other nodes in the cluster.\n\n- CVE-2022-2572: In affected versions of Octopus Server where access is managed by an external authentication provider, it was possible that the API key/keys of a disabled/deleted user were still valid after the access was revoked.\n\n- CVE-2022-26504: Improper authentication in Veeam Backup & Replication 9.5U3, 9.5U4,10.x and 11.x component used for Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) allows attackers execute arbitrary code via Veeam.Backup.PSManager.exe\n\n- CVE-2022-26562: An issue in provider/libserver/ECKrbAuth.cpp of Kopano Core <= v11.0.2.51 contains an issue which allows attackers to authenticate even if the user account or password is expired. It also exists in the predecessor Zarafa Collaboration Platform (ZCP) in provider/libserver/ECPamAuth.cpp of Zarafa >= 6.30 (introduced between 6.30.0 RC1e and 6.30.8 final).\n\n- CVE-2022-3477: The tagDiv Composer WordPress plugin before 3.5, required by the Newspaper WordPress theme before 12.1 and Newsmag WordPress theme before 5.2.2, does not properly implement the Facebook login feature, allowing unauthenticated attackers to login as any user by just knowing their email address\n\n- CVE-2022-36106: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released under the GNU GPL. It has been discovered that the expiration time of a password reset link for TYPO3 backend users has never been evaluated. As a result, a password reset link could be used to perform a password reset even if the default expiry time of two hours has been exceeded. Update to TYPO3 version 10.4.32 or 11.5.16 that fix the problem. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36412: In Zoho ManageEngine SupportCenter Plus before 11023, V3 API requests are vulnerable to authentication bypass. (An API request may, in effect, be executed with the credentials of a user who authenticated in the past.)\n\n- CVE-2022-39238: Arvados is an open source platform for managing and analyzing biomedical big data. In versions prior to 2.4.3, when using Portable Authentication Modules (PAM) for user authentication, if a user presented valid credentials but the account is disabled or otherwise not allowed to access the host (such as an expired password), it would still be accepted for access to Arvados. Other authentication methods (LDAP, OpenID Connect) supported by Arvados are not affected by this flaw. This issue is patched in version 2.4.3. Workaround for this issue is to migrate to a different authentication method supported by Arvados, such as LDAP.\n\n- CVE-2022-39263: `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding.\n\n- CVE-2022-39355: Discourse Patreon enables syncronization between Discourse Groups and Patreon rewards. On sites with Patreon login enabled, an improper authentication vulnerability could be used to take control of a victim's forum account. This vulnerability is patched in commit number 846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e of the discourse-patreon plugin. Out of an abundance of caution, any Discourse accounts which have logged in with an unverified-email Patreon account will be logged out and asked to verify their email address on their next login. As a workaround, disable the patreon integration and log out all users with associated Patreon accounts.\n\n- CVE-2021-3632: A flaw was found in Keycloak. This vulnerability allows anyone to register a new security device or key when there is not a device already registered for any user by using the WebAuthn password-less login flow.\n\n- CVE-2022-46170: CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. When an application uses (1) multiple session cookies (e.g., one for user pages and one for admin pages) and (2) a session handler is set to `DatabaseHandler`, `MemcachedHandler`, or `RedisHandler`, then if an attacker gets one session cookie (e.g., one for user pages), they may be able to access pages that require another session cookie (e.g., for admin pages). This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.2.11 or later. As a workaround, use only one session cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-46316: A thread security vulnerability exists in the authentication process. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-30034: Flower, a web UI for the Celery Python RPC framework, all versions as of 05-02-2022 is vulnerable to an OAuth authentication bypass. An attacker could then access the Flower API to discover and invoke arbitrary Celery RPC calls or deny service by shutting down Celery task nodes.\n\n- CVE-2022-30124: An improper authentication vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat Mobile App <4.14.1.22788 that allowed an attacker with physical access to a mobile device to bypass local authentication (PIN code).\n\n- CVE-2021-43414: An issue was discovered in GNU Hurd before 0.9 20210404-9. The use of an authentication protocol in the proc server is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, which can be exploited for local privilege escalation to get full root access.\n\n- CVE-2022-21684: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Versions prior to 2.7.13 in `stable`, 2.8.0.beta11 in `beta`, and 2.8.0.beta11 in `tests-passed` allow some users to log in to a community before they should be able to do so. A user invited via email to a forum with `must_approve_users` enabled is going to be automatically logged in, bypassing the check that does not allow unapproved users to sign in. They will be able to do everything an approved user can do. If they logout, they cannot log back in. This issue is patched in the `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11. One may disable invites as a workaround. Administrators can increase `min_trust_level_to_allow_invite` to reduce the attack surface to more trusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-2303: An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1. It may be possible for group members to bypass 2FA enforcement enabled at the group level by using Resource Owner Password Credentials grant to obtain an access token without using 2FA.\n\n- CVE-2022-34908: An issue was discovered in the A4N (Aremis 4 Nomad) application 1.5.0 for Android. It possesses an authentication mechanism; however, some features do not require any token or cookie in a request. Therefore, an attacker may send a simple HTTP request to the right endpoint, and obtain authorization to retrieve application data.\n\n- CVE-2022-36755: D-Link DIR845L A1 contains a authentication vulnerability via an AUTHORIZED_GROUP=1 value, as demonstrated by a request for getcfg.php.\n\n- CVE-2022-43400: A vulnerability has been identified in Siveillance Video Mobile Server V2022 R2 (All versions < V22.2a (80)). The mobile server component of affected applications improperly handles the log in for Active Directory accounts that are part of Administrators group. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to access the application without a valid account.\n\n- CVE-2022-48066: An issue in the component global.so of Totolink A830R V4.1.2cu.5182 allows attackers to bypass authentication via a crafted cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-1053: Keylime does not enforce that the agent registrar data is the same when the tenant uses it for validation of the EK and identity quote and the verifier for validating the integrity quote. This allows an attacker to use one AK, EK pair from a real TPM to pass EK validation and give the verifier an AK of a software TPM. A successful attack breaks the entire chain of trust because a not validated AK is used by the verifier. This issue is worse if the validation happens first and then the agent gets added to the verifier because the timing is easier and the verifier does not validate the regcount entry being equal to 1,\n\n- CVE-2022-45124: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the User authentication functionality of WellinTech KingHistorian 35.01.00.05. A specially crafted network packet can lead to a disclosure of sensitive information. An attacker can sniff network traffic to leverage this vulnerability.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-287 (ChildOf)",

The vulnerability is related to the injection of HTTP headers via a CORS ExposeHeader tag. The newline character in the ExposeHeader tag in the CORS configuration file generates a header injection in the response when the CORS request is made. In addition, the prior bug fix for CVE-2020-10753 did not account for the use of \\\\r as a header separator, thus a new flaw has been created.\n\n- CVE-2021-0553: In onBindViewHolder of AppSwitchPreference.java, there is a possible bypass of device admin setttings due to unclear UI. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-11Android ID: A-169936038\n\n- CVE-2021-0594: In onCreate of ConfirmConnectActivity, there is a possible remote bypass of user consent due to improper input validation.

Affected versions were found to be vulnerable to SMTP command injection. The impact varies based on which commands are supported by the backend SMTP server. However, the main risk here is that the attacker can then hijack an already-authenticated SMTP session and run arbitrary SMTP commands as the email user, such as sending emails to other users, changing the FROM user, and so on. As before, this depends on the configuration of the server itself, but newlines should be sanitized to mitigate such arbitrary SMTP command injection. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 22.2.8 , 23.0.5 or 24.0.1. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-31179: Shescape is a simple shell escape package for JavaScript. Versions prior to 1.5.8 were found to be subject to code injection on windows. This impacts users that use Shescape (any API function) to escape arguments for cmd.exe on Windows An attacker can omit all arguments following their input by including a line feed character (`'\\\\n'`) in the payload. This bug has been patched in [v1.5.8] which you can upgrade to now. No further changes are required. Alternatively, line feed characters (`'\\\\n'`) can be stripped out manually or the user input can be made the last argument (this only limits the impact).\n\n- CVE-2022-27924: Zimbra Collaboration (aka ZCS) 8.8.15 and 9.0 allows an unauthenticated attacker to inject arbitrary memcache commands into a targeted instance. These memcache commands becomes unescaped, causing an overwrite of arbitrary cached entries.\n\n- CVE-2022-29631: Jodd HTTP v6.0.9 was discovered to contain multiple CLRF injection vulnerabilities via the components jodd.http.HttpRequest#set and `jodd.http.HttpRequest#send. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via a crafted TCP payload.\n\n- CVE-2022-0391: A flaw was found in Python, specifically within the urllib.parse module. This module helps break Uniform Resource Locator (URL) strings into components. The issue involves how the urlparse method does not sanitize input and allows characters like '\\\\r' and '\\\\n' in the URL path. This flaw allows an attacker to input a crafted URL, leading to injection attacks. This flaw affects Python versions prior to 3.10.0b1, 3.9.5, 3.8.11, 3.7.11 and 3.6.14.\n\n- CVE-2022-25420: NTT Resonant Incorporated goo blog App Web Application 1.0 is vulnerable to CLRF injection.

However, this would cause confusion with \"Cascading Style Sheets,\" so usage of this acronym has declined significantly.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-25926: Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.\n\n- CVE-2021-25963: Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\n\n- CVE-2021-1879: Universal XSS in mobile operating system, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-3580: Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in firewall product leads to XSS (CWE-79), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2014-8958: Admin GUI allows XSS through cookie.\n\n- CVE-2017-9764: Web stats program allows XSS through crafted HTTP header.\n\n- CVE-2014-5198: Web log analysis product allows XSS through crafted HTTP Referer header.\n\n- CVE-2008-5080: Chain: protection mechanism failure allows XSS\n\n- CVE-2006-4308: Chain: incomplete denylist (CWE-184) only checks \"javascript:\" tag, allowing XSS (CWE-79) using other tags\n\n- CVE-2007-5727: Chain: incomplete denylist (CWE-184) only removes SCRIPT tags, enabling XSS (CWE-79)\n\n- CVE-2008-5770: Reflected XSS using the PATH_INFO in a URL\n\n- CVE-2008-4730: Reflected XSS not properly handled when generating an error message\n\n- CVE-2008-5734: Reflected XSS sent through email message.\n\n- CVE-2008-0971: Stored XSS in a security product.\n\n- CVE-2008-5249: Stored XSS using a wiki page.\n\n- CVE-2006-3568: Stored XSS in a guestbook application.\n\n- CVE-2006-3211: Stored XSS in a guestbook application using a javascript: URI in a bbcode img tag.\n\n- CVE-2006-3295: Chain: library file is not protected against a direct request (CWE-425), leading to reflected XSS (CWE-79).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-7050: Codologic Codoforum through 4.8.4 allows a DOM-based XSS. While creating a new topic as a normal user, it is possible to add a poll that is automatically loaded in the DOM once the thread/topic is opened. Because session cookies lack the HttpOnly flag, it is possible to steal authentication cookies and take over accounts.\n\n- CVE-2020-7051: Codologic Codoforum through 4.8.4 allows stored XSS in the login area. This is relevant in conjunction with CVE-2020-5842 because session cookies lack the HttpOnly flag. The impact is account takeover.\n\n- CVE-2021-1543: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an attacker to do the following: Hijack a user session Execute arbitrary commands as a root user on the underlying operating system Conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack Conduct an HTML injection attack For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-21260: Online Invoicing System (OIS) is open source software which is a lean invoicing system for small businesses, consultants and freelancers created using AppGini. In OIS version 4.0 there is a stored XSS which can enables an attacker takeover of the admin account through a payload that extracts a csrf token and sends a request to change password. It has been found that Item description is reflected without sanitization in app/items_view.php which enables the malicious scenario.\n\n- CVE-2021-21283: Flarum is an open source discussion platform for websites. The \"Flarum Sticky\" extension versions 0.1.0-beta.14 and 0.1.0-beta.15 has a cross-site scripting vulnerability. A change in release beta 14 of the Sticky extension caused the plain text content of the first post of a pinned discussion to be injected as HTML on the discussion list. The issue was discovered following an internal audit. Any HTML would be injected through the m.trust() helper. This resulted in an HTML injection where <script> tags would not be executed. However it was possible to run javascript from other HTML attributes, enabling a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack to be performed. Since the exploit only happens with the first post of a pinned discussion, an attacker would need the ability to pin their own discussion, or be able to edit a discussion that was previously pinned. On forums where all pinned posts are authored by your staff, you can be relatively certain the vulnerability has not been exploited. Forums where some user-created discussions were pinned can look at the first post edit date to find whether the vulnerability might have been exploited. Because Flarum doesn't store the post content history, you cannot be certain if a malicious edit was reverted. The fix will be available in version v0.1.0-beta.16 with Flarum beta 16. The fix has already been back-ported to Flarum beta 15 as version v0.1.0-beta.15.1 of the Sticky extension. Forum administrators can disable the Sticky extension until they are able to apply the update. The vulnerability cannot be exploited while the extension is disabled.\n\n- CVE-2021-21332: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.27.0, the password reset endpoint served via Synapse was vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The impact depends on the configuration of the domain that Synapse is deployed on, but may allow access to cookies and other browser data, CSRF vulnerabilities, and access to other resources served on the same domain or parent domains. This is fixed in version 1.27.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-22223: Client-Side code injection through Feature Flag name in GitLab CE/EE starting with 11.9 allows a specially crafted feature flag name to PUT requests on behalf of other users via clicking on a link\n\n- CVE-2021-22722: A CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Stored Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could cause code injection when importing a CSV file or changing station parameters.\n\n- CVE-2021-22723: A CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-siteScripting) through Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could allow an attacker to impersonate the user who manages the charging station or carry out actions on their behalf when crafted malicious parameters are submitted to the charging station web server.\n\n- CVE-2021-24301: The Hotjar Connecticator WordPress plugin through 1.1.1 is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the 'hotjar script' textarea. The request did include a CSRF nonce that was properly verified by the server and this vulnerability could only be exploited by administrator users.\n\n- CVE-2021-24891: The Elementor Website Builder WordPress plugin before 3.4.8 does not sanitise or escape user input appended to the DOM via a malicious hash, resulting in a DOM Cross-Site Scripting issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-25955: In \u201cDolibarr ERP CRM\u201d, WYSIWYG Editor module, v2.8.1 to v13.0.2 are affected by a stored XSS vulnerability that allows low privileged application users to store malicious scripts in the \u201cPrivate Note\u201d field at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint. These scripts are executed in a victim\u2019s browser when they open the page containing the vulnerable field. In the worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged administrator. The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account takeover of the admin and due to other vulnerability (Improper Access Control on Private notes) a low privileged user can update the private notes which could lead to privilege escalation.\n\n- CVE-2021-26929: An XSS issue was discovered in Horde Groupware Webmail Edition through 5.2.22 (where the Horde_Text_Filter library before 2.3.7 is used). The attacker can send a plain text e-mail message, with JavaScript encoded as a link or email that is mishandled by preProcess in Text2html.php, because bespoke use of \\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00 and \\\\x01\\\\x01\\\\x01 interferes with XSS defenses.\n\n- CVE-2021-29208: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29209: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29210: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29459: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. It is possible to persistently inject scripts in XWiki versions prior to 12.6.3 and 12.8. Unregistred users can fill simple text fields. Registered users can fill in their personal information and (if they have edit rights) fill the values of static lists using App Within Minutes. There is no easy workaround except upgrading XWiki. The vulnerability has been patched on XWiki 12.8 and 12.6.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32772: Poddycast is a podcast app made with Electron. Prior to version 0.8.1, an attacker can create a podcast or episode with malicious characters and execute commands on the client machine. The application does not clean the HTML characters of the podcast information obtained from the Feed, which allows the injection of HTML and JS code (cross-site scripting). Being an application made in electron, cross-site scripting can be scaled to remote code execution, making it possible to execute commands on the machine where the application is running. The vulnerability is patched in Poddycast version 0.8.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-34656: The 2Way VideoCalls and Random Chat - HTML5 Webcam Videochat WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the `vws_notice` function found in the ~/inc/requirements.php file which allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 5.2.7.\n\n- CVE-2021-34763: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an attacker to execute a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or an open redirect attack. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-34821: Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in AAT Novus Management System through 1.51.2. The WebUI has wrong HTTP 404 error handling implemented. A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to exploit the issue by sending malicious HTTP requests to non-existing URIs. The value of the URL path filename is copied into the HTML document as plain text tags.\n\n- CVE-2021-3529: A flaw was found in noobaa-core in versions before 5.7.0. This flaw results in the name of an arbitrarily URL being copied into an HTML document as plain text between tags, including potentially a payload script. The input was echoed unmodified in the application response, resulting in arbitrary JavaScript being injected into an application's response. The highest threat to the system is for confidentiality, availability, and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-39186: GlobalNewFiles is a MediaWiki extension maintained by Miraheze. Prior to commit number cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d, the username column of the GlobalNewFiles special page is vulnerable to a stored XSS. Commit number cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d contains a patch. As a workaround, one may disallow <,> (or other characters required to insert html/js) from being used in account names so an XSS is not possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-37541: In JetBrains Hub before 2021.1.13402, HTML injection in the password reset email was possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-34419: In the Zoom Client for Meetings for Ubuntu Linux before version 5.1.0, there is an HTML injection flaw when sending a remote control request to a user in the process of in-meeting screen sharing. This could allow meeting participants to be targeted for social engineering attacks.\n\n- CVE-2021-30057: A stored HTML injection vulnerability exists in Knowage Suite version 7.1. An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML in \"/restful-services/2.0/analyticalDrivers\" via the 'LABEL' and 'NAME' parameters.\n\n- CVE-2021-22232: HTML injection was possible via the full name field before versions 13.11.6, 13.12.6, and 14.0.2 in GitLab CE\n\n- CVE-2020-23050: TAO Open Source Assessment Platform v3.3.0 RC02 was discovered to contain a HTML injection vulnerability in the userFirstName parameter of the user account input field. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute phishing attacks, external redirects, and arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-39348: The LearnPress WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient escaping on the $custom_profile parameter found in the ~/inc/admin/views/backend-user-profile.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 4.1.3.1. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled. Please note that this is seperate from CVE-2021-24702.\n\n- CVE-2021-21333: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.27.0, the notification emails sent for notifications for missed messages or for an expiring account are subject to HTML injection. In the case of the notification for missed messages, this could allow an attacker to insert forged content into the email. The account expiry feature is not enabled by default and the HTML injection is not controllable by an attacker. This is fixed in version 1.27.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-42663: An HTML injection vulnerability exists in Sourcecodester Online Event Booking and Reservation System in PHP/MySQL via the msg parameter to /event-management/index.php. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability in order to change the visibility of the website. Once the target user clicks on a given link he will display the content of the HTML code of the attacker's choice.\n\n- CVE-2021-41248: GraphiQL is the reference implementation of this monorepo, GraphQL IDE, an official project under the GraphQL Foundation. All versions of graphiql older than graphiql@1.4.7 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a vulnerable schema in graphiql. There are a number of ways that can occur. By default, the schema URL is not attacker-controllable in graphiql or in its suggested implementations or examples, leaving only very complex attack vectors. If a custom implementation of graphiql's fetcher allows the schema URL to be set dynamically, such as a URL query parameter like ?endpoint= in graphql-playground, or a database provided value, then this custom graphiql implementation is vulnerable to phishing attacks, and thus much more readily available, low or no privelege level xss attacks. The URLs could look like any generic looking graphql schema URL. It should be noted that desktop clients such as Altair, Insomnia, Postwoman, do not appear to be impacted by this. This vulnerability does not impact codemirror-graphql, monaco-graphql or other dependents, as it exists in onHasCompletion.ts in graphiql. It does impact all forks of graphiql, and every released version of graphiql.\n\n- CVE-2021-41249: GraphQL Playground is a GraphQL IDE for development of graphQL focused applications. All versions of graphql-playground-react older than graphql-playground-react@1.7.28 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a malicious schema in graphql-playground. There are several ways this can occur, including by specifying the URL to a malicious schema in the endpoint query parameter.

Argo CD starting with 2.3.0 and prior to 2.3.6 and 2.4.5 is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript in the `/auth/callback` page in a victim's browser. This vulnerability only affects Argo CD instances which have single sign on (SSO) enabled. The exploit also assumes the attacker has 1) access to the API server's encryption key, 2) a method to add a cookie to the victim's browser, and 3) the ability to convince the victim to visit a malicious `/auth/callback` link. The vulnerability is classified as low severity because access to the API server's encryption key already grants a high level of access. Exploiting the XSS would allow the attacker to impersonate the victim, but would not grant any privileges which the attacker could not otherwise gain using the encryption key. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions 2.4.5 and 2.3.6. There is currently no known workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-3242: Code Injection in GitHub repository microweber/microweber prior to 1.3.2.\n\n- CVE-2022-32763: A cross-site scripting (xss) sanitization vulnerability bypass exists in the SanitizeHtml functionality of Lansweeper lansweeper 10.1.1.0.

An attacker can execute JavaScript code in the browser of the victim if a site is loaded. The victim's encrypted password can be stolen and most likely be decrypted.\n\n- CVE-2022-45004: Gophish through 0.12.1 was discovered to contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via a crafted landing page.\n\n- CVE-2022-45411: Cross-Site Tracing occurs when a server will echo a request back via the Trace method, allowing an XSS attack to access to authorization headers and cookies inaccessible to JavaScript (such as cookies protected by HTTPOnly). To mitigate this attack, browsers placed limits on <code>fetch()</code> and XMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have implemented non-standard headers such as <code>X-Http-Method-Override</code> that override the HTTP method, and made this attack possible again. Thunderbird has applied the same mitigations to the use of this and similar headers. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.\n\n- CVE-2022-39207: Onedev is an open source, self-hosted Git Server with CI/CD and Kanban. During CI/CD builds, it is possible to save build artifacts for later retrieval. They can be accessed through OneDev's web UI after the successful run of a build. These artifact files are served by the webserver in the same context as the UI without any further restrictions. This leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when a user creates a build artifact that contains HTML. When accessing the artifact, the content is rendered by the browser, including any JavaScript that it contains. Since all cookies (except for the rememberMe one) do not set the HttpOnly flag, an attacker could steal the session of a victim and use it to impersonate them. To exploit this issue, attackers need to be able to modify the content of artifacts, which usually means they need to be able to modify a project's build spec. The exploitation requires the victim to click on an attacker's link. It can be used to elevate privileges by targeting admins of a OneDev instance. In the worst case, this can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, because admins can create Server Shell Executors and use them to run any command on the server. This issue has been patched in version 7.3.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-3033: If a Thunderbird user replied to a crafted HTML email containing a <code>meta</code> tag, with the <code>meta</code> tag having the <code>http-equiv=\"refresh\"</code> attribute, and the content attribute specifying an URL, then Thunderbird started a network request to that URL, regardless of the configuration to block remote content. In combination with certain other HTML elements and attributes in the email, it was possible to execute JavaScript code included in the message in the context of the message compose document. The JavaScript code was able to perform actions including, but probably not limited to, read and modify the contents of the message compose document, including the quoted original message, which could potentially contain the decrypted plaintext of encrypted data in the crafted email.

However, including unexpected data in an HTTP header allows an attacker to specify the entirety of the HTTP message that is rendered by the client HTTP agent (e.g., web browser) or back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web server), whether the message is part of a request or a response. \n\n\nWhen an HTTP request contains unexpected CR and LF characters, the server may respond with an output stream that is interpreted as \"splitting\" the stream into two different HTTP messages instead of one. CR is carriage return, also given by %0d or \\r, and LF is line feed, also given by %0a or \\n.\n\n\nIn addition to CR and LF characters, other valid/RFC compliant special characters and unique character encodings can be utilized, such as HT (horizontal tab, also given by %09 or \\t) and SP (space, also given as + sign or %20).\n\n\nThese types of unvalidated and unexpected data in HTTP message headers allow an attacker to control the second \"split\" message to mount attacks such as server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and cache poisoning attacks.\n\n\nHTTP response splitting weaknesses may be present when:\n\n\n  1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request.\n\n  1. The data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without neutralizing malicious characters that can be interpreted as separator characters for headers.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-15811: Chain: Proxy uses a substring search instead of parsing the Transfer-Encoding header (CWE-697), allowing request splitting (CWE-113) and cache poisoning\n\n- CVE-2021-41084: Scala-based HTTP interface allows request splitting and response splitting through header names, header values, status reasons, and URIs\n\n- CVE-2018-12116: Javascript-based framework allows request splitting through a path option of an HTTP request\n\n- CVE-2004-2146: Application accepts CRLF in an object ID, allowing HTTP response splitting.\n\n- CVE-2004-1656: Shopping cart allows HTTP response splitting to perform HTML injection via CRLF in a parameter for a url\n\n- CVE-2005-2060: Bulletin board allows response splitting via CRLF in parameter.\n\n- CVE-2004-2512: Response splitting via CRLF in PHPSESSID.\n\n- CVE-2005-1951: e-commerce app allows HTTP response splitting using CRLF in object id parameters\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0268: An Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting') weakness in J-web of Juniper Networks Junos OS leads to buffer overflows, segment faults, or other impacts, which allows an attacker to modify the integrity of the device and exfiltration information from the device without authentication. The weakness can be exploited to facilitate cross-site scripting (XSS), cookie manipulation (modifying session cookies, stealing cookies) and more. This weakness can also be exploited by directing a user to a seemingly legitimate link from the affected site. The attacker requires no special access or permissions to the device to carry out such attacks. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS: 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S11; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S5; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S3; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S5, 18.4R3-S3; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S2, 19.1R3-S2; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S5, 19.2R2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S3, 19.4R2, 19.4R3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S2, 20.1R2. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 18.1R1.\n\n- CVE-2021-28979: SafeNet KeySecure Management Console 8.12.0 is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially-crafted URL to cause the server to return a split response, once the URL is clicked.\n\n- CVE-2021-41084: http4s is an open source scala interface for HTTP. In affected versions http4s is vulnerable to response-splitting or request-splitting attacks when untrusted user input is used to create any of the following fields: Header names (`Header.name`\u00e5), Header values (`Header.value`), Status reason phrases (`Status.reason`), URI paths (`Uri.Path`), URI authority registered names (`URI.RegName`) (through 0.21). This issue has been resolved in versions 0.21.30, 0.22.5, 0.23.4, and 1.0.0-M27 perform the following. As a matter of practice http4s services and client applications should sanitize any user input in the aforementioned fields before returning a request or response to the backend. The carriage return, newline, and null characters are the most threatening.\n\n- CVE-2021-45818: SAFARI Montage 8.7.32 is affected by a CRLF injection vulnerability which can lead to HTTP response splitting.\n\n- CVE-2021-33621: The cgi gem before 0.1.0.2, 0.2.x before 0.2.2, and 0.3.x before 0.3.5 for Ruby allows HTTP response splitting. This is relevant to applications that use untrusted user input either to generate an HTTP response or to create a CGI::Cookie object.\n\n- CVE-2021-40336: A vulnerability exists in the http web interface where the web interface does not validate data in an HTTP header. This causes a possible HTTP response splitting, which if exploited could lead an attacker to channel down harmful code into the user\u2019s web browser, such as to steal the session cookies. Thus, an attacker who successfully makes an MSM user who has already established a session to MSM web interface clicks a forged link to the MSM web interface, e.g., the link is sent per E-Mail, could trick the user into downloading malicious software onto his computer. This issue affects: Hitachi Energy MSM V2.2 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-41437: An HTTP response splitting attack in web application in ASUS RT-AX88U before v3.0.0.4.388.20558 allows an attacker to craft a specific URL that if an authenticated victim visits it, the URL will give access to the cloud storage of the attacker.\n\n- CVE-2022-20772: A vulnerability in Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an HTTP response splitting attack. This vulnerability is due to the failure of the application or its environment to properly sanitize input values. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious HTTP headers, controlling the response body, or splitting the response into multiple responses.\n\n- CVE-2022-35507: A response-header CRLF injection vulnerability in the Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) and Proxmox Mail Gateway (PMG) web interface allows a remote attacker to set cookies for a victim's browser that are longer than the server expects, causing a client-side DoS. This affects Chromium-based browsers because they allow injection of response headers with %0d. This is fixed in pve-http-server 4.1-3.\n\n- CVE-2022-37240: MDaemon Technologies SecurityGateway for Email Servers 8.5.2 is vulnerable to HTTP Response splitting via the format parameter.\n\n- CVE-2022-37242: MDaemon Technologies SecurityGateway for Email Servers 8.5.2, is vulnerable to HTTP Response splitting via the data parameter.\n\n- CVE-2022-37953: An HTTP response splitting vulnerability exists in the AM Gateway Challenge-Response dialog of WorkstationST (<v07.09.15) and could allow an attacker to compromise a victim's browser/session. WorkstationST is only deployed in specific, controlled environments rendering attack complexity significantly higher than if the attack were conducted on the software in isolation. WorkstationST v07.09.15 can be found in ControlST v07.09.07 SP8 and greater.\n\n- CVE-2022-42471: An improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers ('HTTP Response Splitting') vulnerability [CWE-113] In FortiWeb version 7.0.0 through 7.0.2, FortiWeb version 6.4.0 through 6.4.2, FortiWeb version 6.3.6 through 6.3.20 may allow an authenticated and remote attacker to inject arbitrary headers.\n\n- CVE-2022-42472: A improper neutralization of crlf sequences in http headers ('http response splitting') in Fortinet FortiOS versions 7.2.0 through 7.2.2, 7.0.0 through 7.0.8, 6.4.0 through 6.4.11, 6.2.0 through 6.2.12, 6.0.0 through 6.0.16, FortiProxy 7.2.0 through 7.2.1, 7.0.0 through 7.0.7, 2.0.0 through 2.0.10, 1.2.0 through 1.2.13, 1.1.0 through 1.1.6 may allow an authenticated and remote attacker to perform an HTTP request splitting attack which gives attackers control of the remaining headers and body of the response.\n\n- CVE-2022-47052: The web interface of the 'Nighthawk R6220 AC1200 Smart Wi-Fi Router' is vulnerable to a CRLF Injection attack that can be leveraged to perform Reflected XSS and HTML Injection. A malicious unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted URL. This affects firmware versions: V1.1.0.112_1.0.1, V1.1.0.114_1.0.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-37499: CRLF vulnerability in Reprise License Manager (RLM) web interface through 14.2BL4 in the password parameter in View License Result function, that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers.\n\n- CVE-2022-32453: HTTP header injection vulnerability in Cybozu Office 10.0.0 to 10.8.5 may allow a remote attacker to obtain and/or alter the data of the product via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2022-3918: A program using FoundationNetworking in swift-corelibs-foundation is potentially vulnerable to CRLF ( ) injection in URLRequest headers. In this vulnerability, a client can insert one or several CRLF sequences into a URLRequest header value. When that request is sent via URLSession to an HTTP server, the server may interpret the content after the CRLF as extra headers, or even a second request. For example, consider a URLRequest to http://example.com/ with the GET method. Suppose we set the URLRequest header \"Foo\" to the value \"Bar Extra-Header: Added GET /other HTTP/1.1\". When this request is sent, it will appear to the server as two requests: GET / HTTP/1.1 Foo: Bar Extra-Header: Added GET /other HTTP/1.1 In this manner, the client is able to inject extra headers and craft an entirely new request to a separate path, despite only making one API call in URLSession. If a developer has total control over the request and its headers, this vulnerability may not pose a threat. However, this vulnerability escalates if un-sanitized user input is placed in header values. If so, a malicious user could inject new headers or requests to an intermediary or backend server. Developers should be especially careful to sanitize user input in this case, or upgrade their version of swift-corelibs-foundation to include the patch below.\n\n- CVE-2022-4188: Insufficient validation of untrusted input in CORS in Google Chrome on Android prior to 108.0.5359.71 allowed a remote attacker to bypass same origin policy via a crafted HTML page.

Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-34359: Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n\n- CVE-2017-16783: server-side template injection in content management server\n\n- CVE-2020-9437: authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection\n\n- CVE-2020-12790: Server-Side Template Injection using a Twig template\n\n- CVE-2021-21244: devops platform allows SSTI\n\n- CVE-2020-4027: bypass of Server-Side Template Injection protection mechanism with macros in Velocity templates\n\n- CVE-2020-26282: web browser proxy server allows Java EL expressions from Server-Side Template Injection\n\n- CVE-2020-1961: SSTI involving mail templates and JEXL expressions\n\n- CVE-2019-19999: product does not use a \"safe\" setting for a FreeMarker configuration, allowing SSTI\n\n- CVE-2018-20465: product allows read of sensitive database username/password variables using server-side template injection\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-25283: An issue was discovered in through SaltStack Salt before 3002.5.

In versions before 3.0.0 vault-cli features the ability for rendering templated values. When a secret starts with the prefix `!template!`, vault-cli interprets the rest of the contents of the secret as a Jinja2 template. Jinja2 is a powerful templating engine and is not designed to safely render arbitrary templates. An attacker controlling a jinja2 template rendered on a machine can trigger arbitrary code, making this a Remote Code Execution (RCE) risk. If the content of the vault can be completely trusted, then this is not a problem. Otherwise, if your threat model includes cases where an attacker can manipulate a secret value read from the vault using vault-cli, then this vulnerability may impact you. In 3.0.0, the code related to interpreting vault templated secrets has been removed entirely. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. For users unable to upgrade a workaround does exist. Using the environment variable `VAULT_CLI_RENDER=false` or the flag `--no-render` (placed between `vault-cli` and the subcommand, e.g. `vault-cli --no-render get-all`) or adding `render: false` to the vault-cli configuration yaml file disables rendering and removes the vulnerability. Using the python library, you can use: `vault_cli.get_client(render=False)` when creating your client to get a client that will not render templated secrets and thus operates securely.\n\n- CVE-2021-46063: MCMS v5.2.5 was discovered to contain a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability via the Template Management module.\n\n- CVE-2021-40219: Bolt CMS <= 4.2 is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.

A malicious user can modify the contents of a `confirmation_token` input during the two-factor authentication process to reference a cache value not associated with the login attempt. In rare cases this can allow a malicious actor to authenticate as a random user in the Panel. The malicious user must target an account with two-factor authentication enabled, and then must provide a correct two-factor authentication token before being authenticated as that user. Due to a validation flaw in the logic handling user authentication during the two-factor authentication process a malicious user can trick the system into loading credentials for an arbitrary user by modifying the token sent to the server. This authentication flaw is present in the `LoginCheckpointController@__invoke` method which handles two-factor authentication for a user. This controller looks for a request input parameter called `confirmation_token` which is expected to be a 64 character random alpha-numeric string that references a value within the Panel's cache containing a `user_id` value. This value is then used to fetch the user that attempted to login, and lookup their two-factor authentication token. Due to the design of this system, any element in the cache that contains only digits could be referenced by a malicious user, and whatever value is stored at that position would be used as the `user_id`. There are a few different areas of the Panel that store values into the cache that are integers, and a user who determines what those cache keys are could pass one of those keys which would cause this code pathway to reference an arbitrary user. At its heart this is a high-risk login bypass vulnerability. However, there are a few additional conditions that must be met in order for this to be successfully executed, notably: 1.) The account referenced by the malicious cache key must have two-factor authentication enabled. An account without two-factor authentication would cause an exception to be triggered by the authentication logic, thusly exiting this authentication flow. 2.) Even if the malicious user is able to reference a valid cache key that references a valid user account with two-factor authentication, they must provide a valid two-factor authentication token. However, due to the design of this endpoint once a valid user account is found with two-factor authentication enabled there is no rate-limiting present, thusly allowing an attacker to brute force combinations until successful. This leads to a third condition that must be met: 3.) For the duration of this attack sequence the cache key being referenced must continue to exist with a valid `user_id` value. Depending on the specific key being used for this attack, this value may disappear quickly, or be changed by other random user interactions on the Panel, outside the control of the attacker. In order to mitigate this vulnerability the underlying authentication logic was changed to use an encrypted session store that the user is therefore unable to control the value of. This completely removed the use of a user-controlled value being used. In addition, the code was audited to ensure this type of vulnerability is not present elsewhere.\n\n- CVE-2021-42338: 4MOSAn GCB Doctor\u2019s login page has improper validation of Cookie, which allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass authentication by code injection in cookie, and arbitrarily manipulate the system or interrupt services by upload and execution of arbitrary files.\n\n- CVE-2021-1541: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an attacker to do the following: Hijack a user session Execute arbitrary commands as a root user on the underlying operating system Conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack Conduct an HTML injection attack For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-41317: XSS Hunter Express before 2021-09-17 does not properly enforce authentication requirements for paths.\n\n- CVE-2021-29012: DMA Softlab Radius Manager 4.4.0 assigns the same session cookie to every admin session.

In Envoy version 1.17.0 an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list when Envoy's JWT Authentication filter is configured with the `allow_missing` requirement under `requires_any` due to a mistake in implementation. Envoy's JWT Authentication filter can be configured with the `allow_missing` requirement that will be satisfied if JWT is missing (JwtMissed error) and fail if JWT is presented or invalid. Due to a mistake in implementation, a JwtUnknownIssuer error was mistakenly converted to JwtMissed when `requires_any` was configured. So if `allow_missing` was configured under `requires_any`, an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list. Integrity may be impacted depending on configuration if the JWT token is used to protect against writes or modifications. This regression was introduced on 2020/11/12 in PR 13839 which fixed handling `allow_missing` under RequiresAny in a JwtRequirement (see issue 13458). The AnyVerifier aggregates the children verifiers' results into a final status where JwtMissing is the default error. However, a JwtUnknownIssuer was mistakenly treated the same as a JwtMissing error and the resulting final aggregation was the default JwtMissing. As a result, `allow_missing` would allow a JWT token with an unknown issuer status. This is fixed in version 1.17.1 by PR 15194. The fix works by preferring JwtUnknownIssuer over a JwtMissing error, fixing the accidental conversion and bypass with `allow_missing`. A user could detect whether a bypass occurred if they have Envoy logs enabled with debug verbosity. Users can enable component level debug logs for JWT. The JWT filter logs will indicate that there is a request with a JWT token and a failure that the JWT token is missing.\n\n- CVE-2021-21513: Dell EMC OpenManage Server Administrator (OMSA) version 9.5 Microsoft Windows installations with Distributed Web Server (DWS) enabled configuration contains an authentication bypass vulnerability.

This allowed unauthenticated users to hit that endpoint. This is low-severity issue as the attacker needs to be aware of certain parameters to pass to that endpoint and even after can just get some metadata about a DAG and a Task. This issue affects Apache Airflow 2.0.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-27215: An issue was discovered in genua genugate before 9.0 Z p19, 9.1.x through 9.6.x before 9.6 p7, and 10.x before 10.1 p4. The Web Interfaces (Admin, Userweb, Sidechannel) can use different methods to perform the authentication of a user. A specific authentication method during login does not check the provided data (when a certain manipulation occurs) and returns OK for any authentication request. This allows an attacker to login to the admin panel as a user of his choice, e.g., the root user (with highest privileges) or even a non-existing user.\n\n- CVE-2021-27668: HashiCorp Vault Enterprise 0.9.2 through 1.6.2 allowed the read of license metadata from DR secondaries without authentication.

Due to a bug in ASF code `POST /Api/ASF` ASF API endpoint responsible for updating global ASF config incorrectly removed `IPCPassword` from the resulting config when the caller did not specify it explicitly. Due to the above, it was possible for the user to accidentally remove `IPCPassword` security measure from his IPC interface when updating global ASF config, which exists as part of global config update functionality in ASF-ui. Removal of `IPCPassword` possesses a security risk, as unauthorized users may in result access the IPC interface after such modification. The issue is patched in ASF V5.1.2.4 and future versions. We recommend to manually verify that `IPCPassword` is specified after update, and if not, set it accordingly. In default settings, ASF is configured to allow IPC access from `localhost` only and should not affect majority of users.\n\n- CVE-2021-3282: HashiCorp Vault Enterprise 1.6.0 & 1.6.1 allowed the `remove-peer` raft operator command to be executed against DR secondaries without authentication.

Prior to version 1.10.7, FreeSWITCH does not authenticate SIP MESSAGE requests, leading to spam and message spoofing. By default, SIP requests of the type MESSAGE (RFC 3428) are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. MESSAGE requests are relayed to SIP user agents registered with the FreeSWITCH server without requiring any authentication. Although this behaviour can be changed by setting the `auth-messages` parameter to `true`, it is not the default setting. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to send SIP MESSAGE messages to any SIP user agent that is registered with the server without requiring authentication. Additionally, since no authentication is required, chat messages can be spoofed to appear to come from trusted entities. Therefore, abuse can lead to spam and enable social engineering, phishing and similar attacks. This issue is patched in version 1.10.7. Maintainers recommend that this SIP message type is authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to be explicitly set the `auth-messages` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-38412: Properly formatted POST requests to multiple resources on the HTTP and HTTPS web servers of the Digi PortServer TS 16 Rack device do not require authentication or authentication tokens.

By default, SIP requests of the type SUBSCRIBE are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to subscribe to user agent event notifications without the need to authenticate. This abuse poses privacy concerns and might lead to social engineering or similar attacks. For example, attackers may be able to monitor the status of target SIP extensions. Although this issue was fixed in version v1.10.6, installations upgraded to the fixed version of FreeSWITCH from an older version, may still be vulnerable if the configuration is not updated accordingly. Software upgrades do not update the configuration by default. SIP SUBSCRIBE messages should be authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to explicitly set the `auth-subscriptions` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2020-25566: In SapphireIMS 5.0, it is possible to take over an account by sending a request to the Save_Password form as shown in POC.

It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-5184: API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n\n- CVE-1999-0067: Canonical example of OS command injection.

Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.\n\n- CVE-2022-35954: The GitHub Actions ToolKit provides a set of packages to make creating actions easier. The `core.exportVariable` function uses a well known delimiter that attackers can use to break out of that specific variable and assign values to other arbitrary variables. Workflows that write untrusted values to the `GITHUB_ENV` file may cause the path or other environment variables to be modified without the intention of the workflow or action author. Users should upgrade to `@actions/core v1.9.1`. If you are unable to upgrade the `@actions/core` package, you can modify your action to ensure that any user input does not contain the delimiter `_GitHubActionsFileCommandDelimeter_` before calling `core.exportVariable`.\n\n- CVE-2022-46265: A vulnerability has been identified in Polarion ALM (All versions < V2304.0).

If the token cannot match, the engine \"backtracks\" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.\n Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:\n\n\n  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.\n\n  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.\n\n  - The input can be long enough.\n\n Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. \n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-5243: server allows ReDOS with crafted User-Agent strings, due to overlapping capture groups that cause excessive backtracking.\n\n- CVE-2021-21317: npm package for user-agent parser prone to ReDoS due to overlapping capture groups\n\n- CVE-2019-16215: Markdown parser uses inefficient regex when processing a message, allowing users to cause CPU consumption and delay preventing processing of other messages.\n\n- CVE-2019-6785: Long string in a version control product allows DoS due to an inefficient regex.\n\n- CVE-2019-12041: Javascript code allows ReDoS via a long string due to excessive backtracking.\n\n- CVE-2015-8315: ReDoS when parsing time.\n\n- CVE-2015-8854: ReDoS when parsing documents.\n\n- CVE-2017-16021: ReDoS when validating URL.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-32740: Addressable is an alternative implementation to the URI implementation that is part of Ruby's standard library. An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability exists after version 2.3.0 through version 2.7.0. Within the URI template implementation in Addressable, a maliciously crafted template may result in uncontrolled resource consumption, leading to denial of service when matched against a URI. In typical usage, templates would not normally be read from untrusted user input, but nonetheless, no previous security advisory for Addressable has cautioned against doing this. Users of the parsing capabilities in Addressable but not the URI template capabilities are unaffected. The vulnerability is patched in version 2.8.0. As a workaround, only create Template objects from trusted sources that have been validated not to produce catastrophic backtracking.\n\n- CVE-2021-32763: OpenProject is open-source, web-based project management software. In versions prior to 11.3.3, the `MessagesController` class of OpenProject has a `quote` method that implements the logic behind the Quote button in the discussion forums, and it uses a regex to strip `<pre>` tags from the message being quoted. The `(.|\\\\s)` part can match a space character in two ways, so an unterminated `<pre>` tag containing `n` spaces causes Ruby's regex engine to backtrack to try 2<sup>n</sup> states in the NFA. This will result in a Regular Expression Denial of Service. The issue is fixed in OpenProject 11.3.3. As a workaround, one may install the patch manually.\n\n- CVE-2021-32838: Flask-RESTX (pypi package flask-restx) is a community driven fork of Flask-RESTPlus. Flask-RESTX before version 0.5.1 is vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) in email_regex.

In sqlparse versions 0.4.0 and 0.4.1 there is a regular Expression Denial of Service in sqlparse vulnerability. The regular expression may cause exponential backtracking on strings containing many repetitions of '\\\\r\\\\n' in SQL comments. Only the formatting feature that removes comments from SQL statements is affected by this regular expression. As a workaround don't use the sqlformat.format function with keyword strip_comments=True or the --strip-comments command line flag when using the sqlformat command line tool. The issues has been fixed in sqlparse 0.4.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-33503: An issue was discovered in urllib3 before 1.26.5. When provided with a URL containing many @ characters in the authority component, the authority regular expression exhibits catastrophic backtracking, causing a denial of service if a URL were passed as a parameter or redirected to via an HTTP redirect.\n\n- CVE-2021-33580: User controlled `request.getHeader(\"Referer\")`, `request.getRequestURL()` and `request.getQueryString()` are used to build and run a regex expression. The attacker doesn't have to use a browser and may send a specially crafted Referer header programmatically. Since the attacker controls the string and the regex pattern he may cause a ReDoS by regex catastrophic backtracking on the server side. This problem has been fixed in Roller 6.0.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-33623: The trim-newlines package before 3.0.1 and 4.x before 4.0.1 for Node.js has an issue related to regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) for the .end() method.\n\n- CVE-2021-36716: A ReDoS (regular expression denial of service) flaw was found in the Segment is-email package before 1.0.1 for Node.js.

In affected versions unsanitised input of regular expression date within the parameters of the DPL parser function, allowed for the possibility of ReDoS (Regex Denial of Service). This has been resolved in version 3.3.6. If you are unable to update you may also set `$wgDplSettings['functionalRichness'] = 0;` or disable DynamicPageList3 to mitigate.\n\n- CVE-2021-41186: Fluentd collects events from various data sources and writes them to files to help unify logging infrastructure. The parser_apache2 plugin in Fluentd v0.14.14 to v1.14.1 suffers from a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability. A broken apache log with a certain pattern of string can spend too much time in a regular expression, resulting in the potential for a DoS attack. This issue is patched in version 1.14.2 There are two workarounds available.

In affected versions Zulip allows organization administrators on a server to configure \"linkifiers\" that automatically create links from messages that users send, detected via arbitrary regular expressions. Malicious organization administrators could subject the server to a denial-of-service via regular expression complexity attacks; most simply, by configuring a quadratic-time regular expression in a linkifier, and sending messages that exploited it. A regular expression attempted to parse the user-provided regexes to verify that they were safe from ReDoS -- this was both insufficient, as well as _itself_ subject to ReDoS if the organization administrator entered a sufficiently complex invalid regex. Affected users should [upgrade to the just-released Zulip 4.7](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release), or [`main`](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-from-a-git-repository).\n\n- CVE-2021-41817: Date.parse in the date gem through 3.2.0 for Ruby allows ReDoS (regular expression Denial of Service) via a long string.

Prior to version 4.0.10, the regular expression `inline.reflinkSearch` may cause catastrophic backtracking against some strings and lead to a denial of service (DoS). Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version of marked and does not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is patched in version 4.0.10. As a workaround, avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run marked on a worker thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources.\n\n- CVE-2022-24373: The package react-native-reanimated before 3.0.0-rc.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to improper usage of regular expression in the parser of Colors.js.\n\n- CVE-2022-24713: regex is an implementation of regular expressions for the Rust language. The regex crate features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service attacks caused by untrusted regexes, or untrusted input matched by trusted regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered part of the crate's API. Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing, and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to services accepting user-controlled, untrusted regexes. All versions of the regex crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this issue. The fix is include starting from regex 1.5.5. All users accepting user-controlled regexes are recommended to upgrade immediately to the latest version of the regex crate. Unfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are practically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability. Because of this, it us not recommend to deny known problematic regexes.\n\n- CVE-2022-25598: Apache DolphinScheduler user registration is vulnerable to Regular express Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks, Apache DolphinScheduler users should upgrade to version 2.0.5 or higher.\n\n- CVE-2022-25758: All versions of package scss-tokenizer are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the loadAnnotation() function, due to the usage of insecure regex.\n\n- CVE-2022-25844: The package angular after 1.7.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) by providing a custom locale rule that makes it possible to assign the parameter in posPre: ' '.repeat() of NUMBER_FORMATS.PATTERNS[1].posPre with a very high value. **Note:** 1) This package has been deprecated and is no longer maintained. 2) The vulnerable versions are 1.7.0 and higher.\n\n- CVE-2022-25858: The package terser before 4.8.1, from 5.0.0 and before 5.14.2 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to insecure usage of regular expressions.\n\n- CVE-2022-25887: The package sanitize-html before 2.7.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to insecure global regular expression replacement logic of HTML comment removal.\n\n- CVE-2022-25918: The package shescape from 1.5.10 and before 1.6.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the escape function in index.js, due to the usage of insecure regex in the escapeArgBash function.\n\n- CVE-2022-29158: Apache OFBiz up to version 18.12.05 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the way it handles URLs provided by external, unauthenticated users.

Hawk used a regular expression to parse `Host` HTTP header (`Hawk.utils.parseHost()`), which was subject to regular expression DoS attack - meaning each added character in the attacker's input increases the computation time exponentially. `parseHost()` was patched in `9.0.1` to use built-in `URL` class to parse hostname instead. `Hawk.authenticate()` accepts `options` argument. If that contains `host` and `port`, those would be used instead of a call to `utils.parseHost()`.\n\n- CVE-2022-29169: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions starting with 2.2 and prior to 2.3.19, 2.4.7, and 2.5.0-beta.2 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. By using specific a RegularExpression, an attacker can cause denial of service for the bbb-html5 service. The useragent library performs checking of device by parsing the input of User-Agent header and lets it go through lookupUserAgent() (alias of useragent.lookup() ). This function handles input by regexing and attackers can abuse that by providing some ReDos payload using `SmartWatch`. The maintainers removed `htmlclient/useragent` from versions 2.3.19, 2.4.7, and 2.5.0-beta.2. As a workaround, disable NginX forwarding the requests to the handler according to the directions in the GitHub Security Advisory.\n\n- CVE-2022-31129: moment is a JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates.

The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker. Some kinds of sensitive information include:\n\n\n  - private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details\n\n  - system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages\n\n  - business secrets and intellectual property\n\n  - network status and configuration\n\n  - the product's own code or internal state\n\n  - metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers\n\n  - indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider\n\nInformation might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected. These parties include:\n\n  - the product's own users\n\n  - people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users\n\n  - the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates\n\n  - the developer\n\nInformation exposures can occur in different ways:\n\n  - the code  **explicitly inserts**  sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been \"scrubbed\" or \"sanitized\"\n\n  - a different weakness or mistake  **indirectly inserts**  the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.\n\n  - the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are  **unintentionally made accessible**  to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.\n\nIt is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read. CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store, transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-31162: Rust library leaks Oauth client details in application debug logs\n\n- CVE-2021-25476: Digital Rights Management (DRM) capability for mobile platform leaks pointer information, simplifying ASLR bypass\n\n- CVE-2001-1483: Enumeration of valid usernames based on inconsistent responses\n\n- CVE-2001-1528: Account number enumeration via inconsistent responses.\n\n- CVE-2004-2150: User enumeration via discrepancies in error messages.\n\n- CVE-2005-1205: Telnet protocol allows servers to obtain sensitive environment information from clients.\n\n- CVE-2002-1725: Script calls phpinfo(), revealing system configuration to web user\n\n- CVE-2002-0515: Product sets a different TTL when a port is being filtered than when it is not being filtered, which allows remote attackers to identify filtered ports by comparing TTLs.\n\n- CVE-2004-0778: Version control system allows remote attackers to determine the existence of arbitrary files and directories via the -X command for an alternate history file, which causes different error messages to be returned.\n\n- CVE-2000-1117: Virtual machine allows malicious web site operators to determine the existence of files on the client by measuring delays in the execution of the getSystemResource method.\n\n- CVE-2003-0190: Product immediately sends an error message when a user does not exist, which allows remote attackers to determine valid usernames via a timing attack.\n\n- CVE-2008-2049: POP3 server reveals a password in an error message after multiple APOP commands are sent.

In affected versions users who use [`HttpAuthMiddleware`](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth) (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for Splash authentication will have any non-Splash request expose your credentials to the request target. This includes `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`. Upgrade to scrapy-splash 0.8.0 and use the new `SPLASH_USER` and `SPLASH_PASS` settings instead to set your Splash authentication credentials safely. If you cannot upgrade, set your Splash request credentials on a per-request basis, [using the `splash_headers` request parameter](https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash/tree/0.8.x#http-basic-auth), instead of defining them globally using the [`HttpAuthMiddleware`](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth). Alternatively, make sure all your requests go through Splash. That includes disabling the [robots.txt middleware](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#topics-dlmw-robots).\n\n- CVE-2021-32720: Sylius is an Open Source eCommerce platform on top of Symfony. In versions of Sylius prior to 1.9.5 and 1.10.0-RC.1, part of the details (order ID, order number, items total, and token value) of all placed orders were exposed to unauthorized users. If exploited properly, a few additional information like the number of items in the cart and the date of the shipping may be fetched as well. This data seems to not be crucial nor is personal data, however, could be used for sociotechnical attacks or may expose a few details about shop condition to the third parties. The data possible to aggregate are the number of processed orders or their value in the moment of time. The problem has been patched at Sylius 1.9.5 and 1.10.0-RC.1. There are a few workarounds for the vulnerability. The first possible solution is to hide the problematic endpoints behind the firewall from not logged in users. This would put only the order list under the firewall and allow only authorized users to access it. Once a user is authorized, it will have access to theirs orders only. The second possible solution is to decorate the `\\\\Sylius\\\\Bundle\\\\ApiBundle\\\\Doctrine\\\\QueryCollectionExtension\\\\OrdersByLoggedInUserExtension` and throw `Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Security\\\\Core\\\\Exception\\\\AccessDeniedException` if the class is executed for unauthorized user.\n\n- CVE-2021-39192: Ghost is a Node.js content management system.

            "extended_description": "\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n",

However, including unexpected data in an HTTP header allows an attacker to specify the entirety of the HTTP message that is rendered by the client HTTP agent (e.g., web browser) or back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web server), whether the message is part of a request or a response. \n\n\nWhen an HTTP request contains unexpected CR and LF characters, the server may respond with an output stream that is interpreted as \"splitting\" the stream into two different HTTP messages instead of one. CR is carriage return, also given by %0d or \\r, and LF is line feed, also given by %0a or \\n.\n\n\nIn addition to CR and LF characters, other valid/RFC compliant special characters and unique character encodings can be utilized, such as HT (horizontal tab, also given by %09 or \\t) and SP (space, also given as + sign or %20).\n\n\nThese types of unvalidated and unexpected data in HTTP message headers allow an attacker to control the second \"split\" message to mount attacks such as server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and cache poisoning attacks.\n\n\nHTTP response splitting weaknesses may be present when:\n\n\n  1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request.\n\n  1. The data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without neutralizing malicious characters that can be interpreted as separator characters for headers.\n\n",

Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n",

              "extended_description": "\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n",

However, including unexpected data in an HTTP header allows an attacker to specify the entirety of the HTTP message that is rendered by the client HTTP agent (e.g., web browser) or back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web server), whether the message is part of a request or a response. \n\n\nWhen an HTTP request contains unexpected CR and LF characters, the server may respond with an output stream that is interpreted as \"splitting\" the stream into two different HTTP messages instead of one. CR is carriage return, also given by %0d or \\r, and LF is line feed, also given by %0a or \\n.\n\n\nIn addition to CR and LF characters, other valid/RFC compliant special characters and unique character encodings can be utilized, such as HT (horizontal tab, also given by %09 or \\t) and SP (space, also given as + sign or %20).\n\n\nThese types of unvalidated and unexpected data in HTTP message headers allow an attacker to control the second \"split\" message to mount attacks such as server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and cache poisoning attacks.\n\n\nHTTP response splitting weaknesses may be present when:\n\n\n  1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request.\n\n  1. The data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without neutralizing malicious characters that can be interpreted as separator characters for headers.\n\n",

IBM X-Force ID: 214957.\n\n- CVE-2022-0996: A vulnerability was found in the 389 Directory Server that allows expired passwords to access the database to cause improper authentication.\n\n- CVE-2022-31013: Chat Server is the chat server for Vartalap, an open-source messaging application. Versions 2.3.2 until 2.6.0 suffer from a bug in validating the access token, resulting in authentication bypass. The function `this.authProvider.verifyAccessKey` is an async function, as the code is not using `await` to wait for the verification result. Every time the function responds back with success, along with an unhandled exception if the token is invalid. A patch is available in version 2.6.0.\n\n- CVE-2022-35726: Broken Authentication vulnerability in yotuwp Video Gallery plugin <= 1.3.4.5 at WordPress.\n\n- CVE-2022-36296: Broken Authentication vulnerability in JumpDEMAND Inc. ActiveDEMAND plugin <= 0.2.27 at WordPress allows unauthenticated post update/create/delete. \n\n- CVE-2022-37298: Shinken Solutions Shinken Monitoring Version 2.4.3 affected is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control. The SafeUnpickler class found in shinken/safepickle.py implements a weak authentication scheme when unserializing objects passed from monitoring nodes to the Shinken monitoring server.\n\n- CVE-2022-45724: Incorrect Access Control in Comfast router CF-WR6110N V2.3.1 allows a remote attacker on the same network to perform any HTTP request to an unauthenticated page to force the server to generate a SESSION_ID, and using this SESSION_ID an attacker can then perform authenticated requests.\n\n- CVE-2022-1801: The Very Simple Contact Form WordPress plugin before 11.6 exposes the solution to the captcha in the rendered contact form, both as hidden input fields and as plain text in the page, making it very easy for bots to bypass the captcha check, rendering the page a likely target for spam bots.\n\n- CVE-2022-37163: Bminusl IHateToBudget v1.5.7 employs a weak password policy which allows attackers to potentially gain unauthorized access to the application via brute-force attacks. Additionally, user passwords are hashed without a salt or pepper making it much easier for tools like hashcat to crack the hashes.\n\n- CVE-2022-37164: Inoda OnTrack v3.4 employs a weak password policy which allows attackers to potentially gain unauthorized access to the application via brute-force attacks. Additionally, user passwords are hashed without a salt or pepper making it much easier for tools like hashcat to crack the hashes.\n\n- CVE-2022-28666: Broken Access Control vulnerability in YIKES Inc. Custom Product Tabs for WooCommerce plugin <= 1.7.7 at WordPress leading to &yikes-the-content-toggle option update. \n\n- CVE-2021-36369: An issue was discovered in Dropbear through 2020.81. Due to a non-RFC-compliant check of the available authentication methods in the client-side SSH code, it is possible for an SSH server to change the login process in its favor. This attack can bypass additional security measures such as FIDO2 tokens or SSH-Askpass. Thus, it allows an attacker to abuse a forwarded agent for logging on to another server unnoticed.\n\n- CVE-2021-3827: A flaw was found in keycloak, where the default ECP binding flow allows other authentication flows to be bypassed. By exploiting this behavior, an attacker can bypass the MFA authentication by sending a SOAP request with an AuthnRequest and Authorization header with the user's credentials. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-41638: The authentication checks of the MELAG FTP Server in version 2.2.0.4 are incomplete, which allows a remote attacker to access local files only by using a valid username.\n\n- CVE-2022-0910: A downgrade from two-factor authentication to one-factor authentication vulnerability in the CGI program of Zyxel USG/ZyWALL series firmware versions 4.32 through 4.71, USG FLEX series firmware versions 4.50 through 5.21, ATP series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.21, and VPN series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.21, that could allow an authenticated attacker to bypass the second authentication phase to connect the IPsec VPN server even though the two-factor authentication (2FA) was enabled.\n\n- CVE-2022-1049: A flaw was found in the Pacemaker configuration tool (pcs). The pcs daemon was allowing expired accounts, and accounts with expired passwords to login when using PAM authentication. Therefore, unprivileged expired accounts that have been denied access could still login.\n\n- CVE-2022-1426: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 12.6 before 14.8.6, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.4, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.1. GitLab was not correctly authenticating a user that had some certain amount of information which allowed an user to authenticate without a personal access token.\n\n- CVE-2022-1955: Session 1.13.0 allows an attacker with physical access to the victim's device to bypass the application's password/pin lock to access user data. This is possible due to lack of adequate security controls to prevent dynamic code manipulation.\n\n- CVE-2022-20662: A vulnerability in the smart card login authentication of Cisco Duo for macOS could allow an unauthenticated attacker with physical access to bypass authentication. This vulnerability exists because the assigned user of a smart card is not properly matched with the authenticating user. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by configuring a smart card login to bypass Duo authentication. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use any personal identity verification (PIV) smart card for authentication, even if the smart card is not assigned to the authenticating user.\n\n- CVE-2022-22956: VMware Workspace ONE Access has two authentication bypass vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-22955 & CVE-2022-22956) in the OAuth2 ACS framework. A malicious actor may bypass the authentication mechanism and execute any operation due to exposed endpoints in the authentication framework.\n\n- CVE-2022-23501: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. In versions prior to 8.7.49, 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1 TYPO3 is vulnerable to Improper Authentication. Restricting frontend login to specific users, organized in different storage folders (partitions), can be bypassed. A potential attacker might use this ambiguity in usernames to get access to a different account - however, credentials must be known to the adversary. This issue is patched in versions 8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23600: fleet is an open source device management, built on osquery. Versions prior to 4.9.1 expose a limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with missing audience verification. This impacts deployments using SAML SSO in two specific cases: 1. A malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) could reuse the SAML response to log into Fleet as a user -- only if the user has an account with the same email in Fleet, _and_ the user signs into the malicious SP via SAML SSO from the same Identity Provider (IdP) configured with Fleet. 2. A user with an account in Fleet could reuse a SAML response intended for another SP to log into Fleet. This is only a concern if the user is blocked from Fleet in the IdP, but continues to have an account in Fleet. If the user is blocked from the IdP entirely, this cannot be exploited. Fleet 4.9.1 resolves this issue. Users unable to upgrade should: Reduce the length of sessions on your IdP to reduce the window for malicious re-use, Limit the amount of SAML Service Providers/Applications used by user accounts with access to Fleet, and When removing access to Fleet in the IdP, delete the Fleet user from Fleet as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24259: An incorrect check in the component cdr.php of Voipmonitor GUI before v24.96 allows unauthenticated attackers to escalate privileges via a crafted request.\n\n- CVE-2022-24883: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Prior to version 2.7.0, server side authentication against a `SAM` file might be successful for invalid credentials if the server has configured an invalid `SAM` file path. FreeRDP based clients are not affected. RDP server implementations using FreeRDP to authenticate against a `SAM` file are affected. Version 2.7.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, use custom authentication via `HashCallback` and/or ensure the `SAM` database path configured is valid and the application has file handles left.\n\n- CVE-2022-24885: Nextcloud Android app is the Android client for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to version 3.19.1, users can bypass a lock on the Nextcloud app on an Android device by repeatedly reopening the app. Version 3.19.1 contains a fix for the problem. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24976: Atheme IRC Services before 7.2.12, when used in conjunction with InspIRCd, allows authentication bypass by ending an IRC handshake at a certain point during a challenge-response login sequence.\n\n- CVE-2022-2533: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 12.10 before 15.1.6, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.4, all versions starting from 15.3 before 15.3.2. GitLab was not performing correct authentication with some Package Registries when IP address restrictions were configured, allowing an attacker already in possession of a valid Deploy Token to misuse it from any location.\n\n- CVE-2022-2553: The authfile directive in the booth config file is ignored, preventing use of authentication in communications from node to node. As a result, nodes that do not have the correct authentication key are not prevented from communicating with other nodes in the cluster.\n\n- CVE-2022-2572: In affected versions of Octopus Server where access is managed by an external authentication provider, it was possible that the API key/keys of a disabled/deleted user were still valid after the access was revoked.\n\n- CVE-2022-26504: Improper authentication in Veeam Backup & Replication 9.5U3, 9.5U4,10.x and 11.x component used for Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) allows attackers execute arbitrary code via Veeam.Backup.PSManager.exe\n\n- CVE-2022-26562: An issue in provider/libserver/ECKrbAuth.cpp of Kopano Core <= v11.0.2.51 contains an issue which allows attackers to authenticate even if the user account or password is expired. It also exists in the predecessor Zarafa Collaboration Platform (ZCP) in provider/libserver/ECPamAuth.cpp of Zarafa >= 6.30 (introduced between 6.30.0 RC1e and 6.30.8 final).\n\n- CVE-2022-3477: The tagDiv Composer WordPress plugin before 3.5, required by the Newspaper WordPress theme before 12.1 and Newsmag WordPress theme before 5.2.2, does not properly implement the Facebook login feature, allowing unauthenticated attackers to login as any user by just knowing their email address\n\n- CVE-2022-36106: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released under the GNU GPL. It has been discovered that the expiration time of a password reset link for TYPO3 backend users has never been evaluated. As a result, a password reset link could be used to perform a password reset even if the default expiry time of two hours has been exceeded. Update to TYPO3 version 10.4.32 or 11.5.16 that fix the problem. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36412: In Zoho ManageEngine SupportCenter Plus before 11023, V3 API requests are vulnerable to authentication bypass. (An API request may, in effect, be executed with the credentials of a user who authenticated in the past.)\n\n- CVE-2022-39238: Arvados is an open source platform for managing and analyzing biomedical big data. In versions prior to 2.4.3, when using Portable Authentication Modules (PAM) for user authentication, if a user presented valid credentials but the account is disabled or otherwise not allowed to access the host (such as an expired password), it would still be accepted for access to Arvados. Other authentication methods (LDAP, OpenID Connect) supported by Arvados are not affected by this flaw. This issue is patched in version 2.4.3. Workaround for this issue is to migrate to a different authentication method supported by Arvados, such as LDAP.\n\n- CVE-2022-39263: `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding.\n\n- CVE-2022-39355: Discourse Patreon enables syncronization between Discourse Groups and Patreon rewards. On sites with Patreon login enabled, an improper authentication vulnerability could be used to take control of a victim's forum account. This vulnerability is patched in commit number 846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e of the discourse-patreon plugin. Out of an abundance of caution, any Discourse accounts which have logged in with an unverified-email Patreon account will be logged out and asked to verify their email address on their next login. As a workaround, disable the patreon integration and log out all users with associated Patreon accounts.\n\n- CVE-2021-3632: A flaw was found in Keycloak. This vulnerability allows anyone to register a new security device or key when there is not a device already registered for any user by using the WebAuthn password-less login flow.\n\n- CVE-2022-46170: CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. When an application uses (1) multiple session cookies (e.g., one for user pages and one for admin pages) and (2) a session handler is set to `DatabaseHandler`, `MemcachedHandler`, or `RedisHandler`, then if an attacker gets one session cookie (e.g., one for user pages), they may be able to access pages that require another session cookie (e.g., for admin pages). This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.2.11 or later. As a workaround, use only one session cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-46316: A thread security vulnerability exists in the authentication process. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-30034: Flower, a web UI for the Celery Python RPC framework, all versions as of 05-02-2022 is vulnerable to an OAuth authentication bypass. An attacker could then access the Flower API to discover and invoke arbitrary Celery RPC calls or deny service by shutting down Celery task nodes.\n\n- CVE-2022-30124: An improper authentication vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat Mobile App <4.14.1.22788 that allowed an attacker with physical access to a mobile device to bypass local authentication (PIN code).\n\n- CVE-2021-43414: An issue was discovered in GNU Hurd before 0.9 20210404-9. The use of an authentication protocol in the proc server is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, which can be exploited for local privilege escalation to get full root access.\n\n- CVE-2022-21684: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Versions prior to 2.7.13 in `stable`, 2.8.0.beta11 in `beta`, and 2.8.0.beta11 in `tests-passed` allow some users to log in to a community before they should be able to do so. A user invited via email to a forum with `must_approve_users` enabled is going to be automatically logged in, bypassing the check that does not allow unapproved users to sign in. They will be able to do everything an approved user can do. If they logout, they cannot log back in. This issue is patched in the `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11. One may disable invites as a workaround. Administrators can increase `min_trust_level_to_allow_invite` to reduce the attack surface to more trusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-2303: An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1. It may be possible for group members to bypass 2FA enforcement enabled at the group level by using Resource Owner Password Credentials grant to obtain an access token without using 2FA.\n\n- CVE-2022-34908: An issue was discovered in the A4N (Aremis 4 Nomad) application 1.5.0 for Android. It possesses an authentication mechanism; however, some features do not require any token or cookie in a request. Therefore, an attacker may send a simple HTTP request to the right endpoint, and obtain authorization to retrieve application data.\n\n- CVE-2022-36755: D-Link DIR845L A1 contains a authentication vulnerability via an AUTHORIZED_GROUP=1 value, as demonstrated by a request for getcfg.php.\n\n- CVE-2022-43400: A vulnerability has been identified in Siveillance Video Mobile Server V2022 R2 (All versions < V22.2a (80)). The mobile server component of affected applications improperly handles the log in for Active Directory accounts that are part of Administrators group. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to access the application without a valid account.\n\n- CVE-2022-48066: An issue in the component global.so of Totolink A830R V4.1.2cu.5182 allows attackers to bypass authentication via a crafted cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-1053: Keylime does not enforce that the agent registrar data is the same when the tenant uses it for validation of the EK and identity quote and the verifier for validating the integrity quote. This allows an attacker to use one AK, EK pair from a real TPM to pass EK validation and give the verifier an AK of a software TPM. A successful attack breaks the entire chain of trust because a not validated AK is used by the verifier. This issue is worse if the validation happens first and then the agent gets added to the verifier because the timing is easier and the verifier does not validate the regcount entry being equal to 1,\n\n- CVE-2022-45124: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the User authentication functionality of WellinTech KingHistorian 35.01.00.05. A specially crafted network packet can lead to a disclosure of sensitive information.

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability to modify the HTTP response header information through a specially crafted HTTP request.\n\n- CVE-2021-41314: Certain NETGEAR smart switches are affected by a \\\\n injection in the web UI's password field, which - due to several faulty aspects of the authentication scheme - allows the attacker to create (or overwrite) a file with specific content (e.g., the \"2\" string). This leads to admin session crafting and therefore gaining full web UI admin privileges by an unauthenticated attacker. This affects GC108P before 1.0.8.2, GC108PP before 1.0.8.2, GS108Tv3 before 7.0.7.2, GS110TPP before 7.0.7.2, GS110TPv3 before 7.0.7.2, GS110TUP before 1.0.5.3, GS308T before 1.0.3.2, GS310TP before 1.0.3.2, GS710TUP before 1.0.5.3, GS716TP before 1.0.4.2, GS716TPP before 1.0.4.2, GS724TPP before 2.0.6.3, GS724TPv2 before 2.0.6.3, GS728TPPv2 before 6.0.8.2, GS728TPv2 before 6.0.8.2, GS750E before 1.0.1.10, GS752TPP before 6.0.8.2, GS752TPv2 before 6.0.8.2, MS510TXM before 1.0.4.2, and MS510TXUP before 1.0.4.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-31164: Apache Unomi prior to version 1.5.5 allows CRLF log injection because of the lack of escaping in the log statements.\n\n- CVE-2021-38189: An issue was discovered in the lettre crate before 0.9.6 for Rust. In an e-mail message body, an attacker can place a . character after two <CR><LF> sequences and then inject arbitrary SMTP commands.\n\n- CVE-2021-30540: Incorrect security UI in payments in Google Chrome on Android prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to perform domain spoofing via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-25682: It was discovered that the get_pid_info() function in data/apport did not properly parse the /proc/pid/status file from the kernel.\n\n- CVE-2021-3524: A flaw was found in the Red Hat Ceph Storage RadosGW (Ceph Object Gateway) in versions before 14.2.21. The vulnerability is related to the injection of HTTP headers via a CORS ExposeHeader tag. The newline character in the ExposeHeader tag in the CORS configuration file generates a header injection in the response when the CORS request is made. In addition, the prior bug fix for CVE-2020-10753 did not account for the use of \\\\r as a header separator, thus a new flaw has been created.\n\n- CVE-2021-0553: In onBindViewHolder of AppSwitchPreference.java, there is a possible bypass of device admin setttings due to unclear UI. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-11Android ID: A-169936038\n\n- CVE-2021-0594: In onCreate of ConfirmConnectActivity, there is a possible remote bypass of user consent due to improper input validation.

Affected versions were found to be vulnerable to SMTP command injection. The impact varies based on which commands are supported by the backend SMTP server. However, the main risk here is that the attacker can then hijack an already-authenticated SMTP session and run arbitrary SMTP commands as the email user, such as sending emails to other users, changing the FROM user, and so on. As before, this depends on the configuration of the server itself, but newlines should be sanitized to mitigate such arbitrary SMTP command injection. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 22.2.8 , 23.0.5 or 24.0.1. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-31179: Shescape is a simple shell escape package for JavaScript. Versions prior to 1.5.8 were found to be subject to code injection on windows. This impacts users that use Shescape (any API function) to escape arguments for cmd.exe on Windows An attacker can omit all arguments following their input by including a line feed character (`'\\\\n'`) in the payload. This bug has been patched in [v1.5.8] which you can upgrade to now. No further changes are required. Alternatively, line feed characters (`'\\\\n'`) can be stripped out manually or the user input can be made the last argument (this only limits the impact).\n\n- CVE-2022-27924: Zimbra Collaboration (aka ZCS) 8.8.15 and 9.0 allows an unauthenticated attacker to inject arbitrary memcache commands into a targeted instance. These memcache commands becomes unescaped, causing an overwrite of arbitrary cached entries.\n\n- CVE-2022-29631: Jodd HTTP v6.0.9 was discovered to contain multiple CLRF injection vulnerabilities via the components jodd.http.HttpRequest#set and `jodd.http.HttpRequest#send. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via a crafted TCP payload.\n\n- CVE-2022-0391: A flaw was found in Python, specifically within the urllib.parse module. This module helps break Uniform Resource Locator (URL) strings into components. The issue involves how the urlparse method does not sanitize input and allows characters like '\\\\r' and '\\\\n' in the URL path. This flaw allows an attacker to input a crafted URL, leading to injection attacks. This flaw affects Python versions prior to 3.10.0b1, 3.9.5, 3.8.11, 3.7.11 and 3.6.14.\n\n- CVE-2022-25420: NTT Resonant Incorporated goo blog App Web Application 1.0 is vulnerable to CLRF injection.

Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-25926: Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.\n\n- CVE-2021-25963: Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\n\n- CVE-2021-1879: Universal XSS in mobile operating system, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-3580: Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in firewall product leads to XSS (CWE-79), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2014-8958: Admin GUI allows XSS through cookie.\n\n- CVE-2017-9764: Web stats program allows XSS through crafted HTTP header.\n\n- CVE-2014-5198: Web log analysis product allows XSS through crafted HTTP Referer header.\n\n- CVE-2008-5080: Chain: protection mechanism failure allows XSS\n\n- CVE-2006-4308: Chain: incomplete denylist (CWE-184) only checks \"javascript:\" tag, allowing XSS (CWE-79) using other tags\n\n- CVE-2007-5727: Chain: incomplete denylist (CWE-184) only removes SCRIPT tags, enabling XSS (CWE-79)\n\n- CVE-2008-5770: Reflected XSS using the PATH_INFO in a URL\n\n- CVE-2008-4730: Reflected XSS not properly handled when generating an error message\n\n- CVE-2008-5734: Reflected XSS sent through email message.\n\n- CVE-2008-0971: Stored XSS in a security product.\n\n- CVE-2008-5249: Stored XSS using a wiki page.\n\n- CVE-2006-3568: Stored XSS in a guestbook application.\n\n- CVE-2006-3211: Stored XSS in a guestbook application using a javascript: URI in a bbcode img tag.\n\n- CVE-2006-3295: Chain: library file is not protected against a direct request (CWE-425), leading to reflected XSS (CWE-79).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-7050: Codologic Codoforum through 4.8.4 allows a DOM-based XSS. While creating a new topic as a normal user, it is possible to add a poll that is automatically loaded in the DOM once the thread/topic is opened. Because session cookies lack the HttpOnly flag, it is possible to steal authentication cookies and take over accounts.\n\n- CVE-2020-7051: Codologic Codoforum through 4.8.4 allows stored XSS in the login area. This is relevant in conjunction with CVE-2020-5842 because session cookies lack the HttpOnly flag. The impact is account takeover.\n\n- CVE-2021-1543: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an attacker to do the following: Hijack a user session Execute arbitrary commands as a root user on the underlying operating system Conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack Conduct an HTML injection attack For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-21260: Online Invoicing System (OIS) is open source software which is a lean invoicing system for small businesses, consultants and freelancers created using AppGini. In OIS version 4.0 there is a stored XSS which can enables an attacker takeover of the admin account through a payload that extracts a csrf token and sends a request to change password. It has been found that Item description is reflected without sanitization in app/items_view.php which enables the malicious scenario.\n\n- CVE-2021-21283: Flarum is an open source discussion platform for websites. The \"Flarum Sticky\" extension versions 0.1.0-beta.14 and 0.1.0-beta.15 has a cross-site scripting vulnerability. A change in release beta 14 of the Sticky extension caused the plain text content of the first post of a pinned discussion to be injected as HTML on the discussion list. The issue was discovered following an internal audit. Any HTML would be injected through the m.trust() helper. This resulted in an HTML injection where <script> tags would not be executed. However it was possible to run javascript from other HTML attributes, enabling a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack to be performed. Since the exploit only happens with the first post of a pinned discussion, an attacker would need the ability to pin their own discussion, or be able to edit a discussion that was previously pinned. On forums where all pinned posts are authored by your staff, you can be relatively certain the vulnerability has not been exploited. Forums where some user-created discussions were pinned can look at the first post edit date to find whether the vulnerability might have been exploited. Because Flarum doesn't store the post content history, you cannot be certain if a malicious edit was reverted. The fix will be available in version v0.1.0-beta.16 with Flarum beta 16. The fix has already been back-ported to Flarum beta 15 as version v0.1.0-beta.15.1 of the Sticky extension. Forum administrators can disable the Sticky extension until they are able to apply the update. The vulnerability cannot be exploited while the extension is disabled.\n\n- CVE-2021-21332: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.27.0, the password reset endpoint served via Synapse was vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The impact depends on the configuration of the domain that Synapse is deployed on, but may allow access to cookies and other browser data, CSRF vulnerabilities, and access to other resources served on the same domain or parent domains. This is fixed in version 1.27.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-22223: Client-Side code injection through Feature Flag name in GitLab CE/EE starting with 11.9 allows a specially crafted feature flag name to PUT requests on behalf of other users via clicking on a link\n\n- CVE-2021-22722: A CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Stored Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could cause code injection when importing a CSV file or changing station parameters.\n\n- CVE-2021-22723: A CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-siteScripting) through Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could allow an attacker to impersonate the user who manages the charging station or carry out actions on their behalf when crafted malicious parameters are submitted to the charging station web server.\n\n- CVE-2021-24301: The Hotjar Connecticator WordPress plugin through 1.1.1 is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the 'hotjar script' textarea. The request did include a CSRF nonce that was properly verified by the server and this vulnerability could only be exploited by administrator users.\n\n- CVE-2021-24891: The Elementor Website Builder WordPress plugin before 3.4.8 does not sanitise or escape user input appended to the DOM via a malicious hash, resulting in a DOM Cross-Site Scripting issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-25955: In \u201cDolibarr ERP CRM\u201d, WYSIWYG Editor module, v2.8.1 to v13.0.2 are affected by a stored XSS vulnerability that allows low privileged application users to store malicious scripts in the \u201cPrivate Note\u201d field at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint. These scripts are executed in a victim\u2019s browser when they open the page containing the vulnerable field. In the worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged administrator. The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account takeover of the admin and due to other vulnerability (Improper Access Control on Private notes) a low privileged user can update the private notes which could lead to privilege escalation.\n\n- CVE-2021-26929: An XSS issue was discovered in Horde Groupware Webmail Edition through 5.2.22 (where the Horde_Text_Filter library before 2.3.7 is used). The attacker can send a plain text e-mail message, with JavaScript encoded as a link or email that is mishandled by preProcess in Text2html.php, because bespoke use of \\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00 and \\\\x01\\\\x01\\\\x01 interferes with XSS defenses.\n\n- CVE-2021-29208: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29209: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29210: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29459: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. It is possible to persistently inject scripts in XWiki versions prior to 12.6.3 and 12.8. Unregistred users can fill simple text fields. Registered users can fill in their personal information and (if they have edit rights) fill the values of static lists using App Within Minutes. There is no easy workaround except upgrading XWiki. The vulnerability has been patched on XWiki 12.8 and 12.6.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32772: Poddycast is a podcast app made with Electron. Prior to version 0.8.1, an attacker can create a podcast or episode with malicious characters and execute commands on the client machine. The application does not clean the HTML characters of the podcast information obtained from the Feed, which allows the injection of HTML and JS code (cross-site scripting). Being an application made in electron, cross-site scripting can be scaled to remote code execution, making it possible to execute commands on the machine where the application is running. The vulnerability is patched in Poddycast version 0.8.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-34656: The 2Way VideoCalls and Random Chat - HTML5 Webcam Videochat WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the `vws_notice` function found in the ~/inc/requirements.php file which allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 5.2.7.\n\n- CVE-2021-34763: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an attacker to execute a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or an open redirect attack.

The value of the URL path filename is copied into the HTML document as plain text tags.\n\n- CVE-2021-3529: A flaw was found in noobaa-core in versions before 5.7.0. This flaw results in the name of an arbitrarily URL being copied into an HTML document as plain text between tags, including potentially a payload script. The input was echoed unmodified in the application response, resulting in arbitrary JavaScript being injected into an application's response. The highest threat to the system is for confidentiality, availability, and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-39186: GlobalNewFiles is a MediaWiki extension maintained by Miraheze. Prior to commit number cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d, the username column of the GlobalNewFiles special page is vulnerable to a stored XSS. Commit number cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d contains a patch. As a workaround, one may disallow <,> (or other characters required to insert html/js) from being used in account names so an XSS is not possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-37541: In JetBrains Hub before 2021.1.13402, HTML injection in the password reset email was possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-34419: In the Zoom Client for Meetings for Ubuntu Linux before version 5.1.0, there is an HTML injection flaw when sending a remote control request to a user in the process of in-meeting screen sharing.

This vulnerability allows attackers to execute phishing attacks, external redirects, and arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-39348: The LearnPress WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient escaping on the $custom_profile parameter found in the ~/inc/admin/views/backend-user-profile.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 4.1.3.1. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled. Please note that this is seperate from CVE-2021-24702.\n\n- CVE-2021-21333: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.27.0, the notification emails sent for notifications for missed messages or for an expiring account are subject to HTML injection. In the case of the notification for missed messages, this could allow an attacker to insert forged content into the email. The account expiry feature is not enabled by default and the HTML injection is not controllable by an attacker. This is fixed in version 1.27.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-42663: An HTML injection vulnerability exists in Sourcecodester Online Event Booking and Reservation System in PHP/MySQL via the msg parameter to /event-management/index.php. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability in order to change the visibility of the website. Once the target user clicks on a given link he will display the content of the HTML code of the attacker's choice.\n\n- CVE-2021-41248: GraphiQL is the reference implementation of this monorepo, GraphQL IDE, an official project under the GraphQL Foundation. All versions of graphiql older than graphiql@1.4.7 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a vulnerable schema in graphiql. There are a number of ways that can occur. By default, the schema URL is not attacker-controllable in graphiql or in its suggested implementations or examples, leaving only very complex attack vectors. If a custom implementation of graphiql's fetcher allows the schema URL to be set dynamically, such as a URL query parameter like ?endpoint= in graphql-playground, or a database provided value, then this custom graphiql implementation is vulnerable to phishing attacks, and thus much more readily available, low or no privelege level xss attacks. The URLs could look like any generic looking graphql schema URL. It should be noted that desktop clients such as Altair, Insomnia, Postwoman, do not appear to be impacted by this. This vulnerability does not impact codemirror-graphql, monaco-graphql or other dependents, as it exists in onHasCompletion.ts in graphiql. It does impact all forks of graphiql, and every released version of graphiql.\n\n- CVE-2021-41249: GraphQL Playground is a GraphQL IDE for development of graphQL focused applications. All versions of graphql-playground-react older than graphql-playground-react@1.7.28 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a malicious schema in graphql-playground. There are several ways this can occur, including by specifying the URL to a malicious schema in the endpoint query parameter. If a user clicks on a link to a GraphQL Playground installation that specifies a malicious server, arbitrary JavaScript can run in the user's browser, which can be used to exfiltrate user credentials or other harmful goals. If you are using graphql-playground-react directly in your client app, upgrade to version 1.7.28 or later.\n\n- CVE-2021-41825: Verint Workforce Optimization (WFO) 15.2.5.1033 allows HTML injection via the /wfo/control/signin username parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-42564: An open redirect through HTML injection in confidential messages in Cryptshare before 5.1.0 allows remote attackers (with permission to provide confidential messages via Cryptshare) to redirect targeted victims to any URL via the '<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\"' substring in the editor parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-43683: pictshare v1.5 is affected by a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in api/info.php. The exit function will terminate the script and print the message which has $_REQUEST['hash'].\n\n- CVE-2021-31682: The login portal for the Automated Logic WebCTRL/WebCTRL OEM web application contains a vulnerability that allows for reflected XSS attacks due to the operatorlocale GET parameter not being sanitized. This issue impacts versions 6.5 and below. This issue works by passing in a basic XSS payload to a vulnerable GET parameter that is reflected in the output without sanitization.\n\n- CVE-2021-21313: GLPI is open source software which stands for Gestionnaire Libre de Parc Informatique and it is a Free Asset and IT Management Software package. In GLPI before verison 9.5.4, there is a vulnerability in the /ajax/common.tabs.php endpoint, indeed, at least two parameters _target and id are not properly sanitized.

Users of MuWire desktop client prior to version 0.8.8 can be de-anonymized by an attacker who knows their full ID. An attacker could send a message with a subject line containing a URL with an HTML image tag and the MuWire client would try to fetch that image via clearnet, thus exposing the IP address of the user. The problem is fixed in MuWire 0.8.8. As a workaround, users can disable messaging functionality to prevent other users from sending them malicious messages.\n\n- CVE-2021-42367: The Variation Swatches for WooCommerce WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters found in the ~/includes/class-menu-page.php file which allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 2.1.1.

This can then be leveraged to execute a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack to escalate privileges to administrator.\n\n- CVE-2021-43862: jQuery Terminal Emulator is a plugin for creating command line interpreters in your applications. Versions prior to 2.31.1 contain a low impact and limited cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The code for XSS payload is always visible, but an attacker can use other techniques to hide the code the victim sees. If the application uses the `execHash` option and executes code from URL, the attacker can use this URL to execute their code. The scope is limited because the javascript attribute used is added to span tag, so no automatic execution like with `onerror` on images is possible. This issue is fixed in version 2.31.1. As a workaround, the user can use formatting that wrap whole user input and its no op. The code for this workaround is available in the GitHub Security Advisory. The fix will only work when user of the library is not using different formatters (e.g. to highlight code in different way).\n\n- CVE-2021-43961: Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager 3.36.0 allows HTML Injection.\n\n- CVE-2021-44082: textpattern 4.8.7 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) via /textpattern/index.php,Body.

Argo CD starting with 2.3.0 and prior to 2.3.6 and 2.4.5 is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript in the `/auth/callback` page in a victim's browser. This vulnerability only affects Argo CD instances which have single sign on (SSO) enabled. The exploit also assumes the attacker has 1) access to the API server's encryption key, 2) a method to add a cookie to the victim's browser, and 3) the ability to convince the victim to visit a malicious `/auth/callback` link. The vulnerability is classified as low severity because access to the API server's encryption key already grants a high level of access. Exploiting the XSS would allow the attacker to impersonate the victim, but would not grant any privileges which the attacker could not otherwise gain using the encryption key. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions 2.4.5 and 2.3.6. There is currently no known workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-3242: Code Injection in GitHub repository microweber/microweber prior to 1.3.2.\n\n- CVE-2022-32763: A cross-site scripting (xss) sanitization vulnerability bypass exists in the SanitizeHtml functionality of Lansweeper lansweeper 10.1.1.0.

To mitigate this attack, browsers placed limits on <code>fetch()</code> and XMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have implemented non-standard headers such as <code>X-Http-Method-Override</code> that override the HTTP method, and made this attack possible again. Thunderbird has applied the same mitigations to the use of this and similar headers. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.\n\n- CVE-2022-39207: Onedev is an open source, self-hosted Git Server with CI/CD and Kanban. During CI/CD builds, it is possible to save build artifacts for later retrieval. They can be accessed through OneDev's web UI after the successful run of a build. These artifact files are served by the webserver in the same context as the UI without any further restrictions. This leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when a user creates a build artifact that contains HTML. When accessing the artifact, the content is rendered by the browser, including any JavaScript that it contains. Since all cookies (except for the rememberMe one) do not set the HttpOnly flag, an attacker could steal the session of a victim and use it to impersonate them. To exploit this issue, attackers need to be able to modify the content of artifacts, which usually means they need to be able to modify a project's build spec. The exploitation requires the victim to click on an attacker's link. It can be used to elevate privileges by targeting admins of a OneDev instance. In the worst case, this can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, because admins can create Server Shell Executors and use them to run any command on the server. This issue has been patched in version 7.3.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-3033: If a Thunderbird user replied to a crafted HTML email containing a <code>meta</code> tag, with the <code>meta</code> tag having the <code>http-equiv=\"refresh\"</code> attribute, and the content attribute specifying an URL, then Thunderbird started a network request to that URL, regardless of the configuration to block remote content. In combination with certain other HTML elements and attributes in the email, it was possible to execute JavaScript code included in the message in the context of the message compose document. The JavaScript code was able to perform actions including, but probably not limited to, read and modify the contents of the message compose document, including the quoted original message, which could potentially contain the decrypted plaintext of encrypted data in the crafted email. The contents could then be transmitted to the network, either to the URL specified in the META refresh tag, or to a different URL, as the JavaScript code could modify the URL specified in the document. This bug doesn't affect users who have changed the default Message Body display setting to 'simple html' or 'plain text'. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.2.1 and Thunderbird < 91.13.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-29444: Plugin Settings Change leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Cloudways Breeze plugin <= 2.0.2 on WordPress allows users with a subscriber or higher user role to execute any of the wp_ajax_* actions in the class Breeze_Configuration which includes the ability to change any of the plugin's settings including CDN setting which could be further used for XSS attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-36176: Multiple uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerabilities in the web interface of FortiPortal before 6.0.6 may allow a single low-privileged user to induce a denial of service via multiple HTTP requests.\n\n- CVE-2021-43929: Improper neutralization of special elements in output used by a downstream component ('Injection') vulnerability in work flow management in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 7.0.1-42218-2 allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2022-2178: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Saysis Computer Starcities allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).This issue affects Starcities: before 1.1. \n\n- CVE-2022-38628: Nortek Linear eMerge E3-Series 0.32-08f, 0.32-07p, 0.32-07e, 0.32-09c, 0.32-09b, 0.32-09a, and 0.32-08e were discovered to contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability which is chained with a local session fixation.

An attacker is able to inject arbitrary `CSS` into the generated graph allowing them to change the styling of elements outside of the generated graph, and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information by using specially crafted `CSS` selectors. The following example shows how an attacker can exfiltrate the contents of an input field by bruteforcing the `value` attribute one character at a time. Whenever there is an actual match, an `http` request will be made by the browser in order to \"load\" a background image that will let an attacker know what's the value of the character. This issue may lead to `Information Disclosure` via CSS selectors and functions able to generate HTTP requests. This also allows an attacker to change the document in ways which may lead a user to perform unintended actions, such as clicking on a link, etc. This issue has been resolved in version 9.1.3.

However, including unexpected data in an HTTP header allows an attacker to specify the entirety of the HTTP message that is rendered by the client HTTP agent (e.g., web browser) or back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web server), whether the message is part of a request or a response. \n\n\nWhen an HTTP request contains unexpected CR and LF characters, the server may respond with an output stream that is interpreted as \"splitting\" the stream into two different HTTP messages instead of one. CR is carriage return, also given by %0d or \\r, and LF is line feed, also given by %0a or \\n.\n\n\nIn addition to CR and LF characters, other valid/RFC compliant special characters and unique character encodings can be utilized, such as HT (horizontal tab, also given by %09 or \\t) and SP (space, also given as + sign or %20).\n\n\nThese types of unvalidated and unexpected data in HTTP message headers allow an attacker to control the second \"split\" message to mount attacks such as server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and cache poisoning attacks.\n\n\nHTTP response splitting weaknesses may be present when:\n\n\n  1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request.\n\n  1. The data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without neutralizing malicious characters that can be interpreted as separator characters for headers.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-15811: Chain: Proxy uses a substring search instead of parsing the Transfer-Encoding header (CWE-697), allowing request splitting (CWE-113) and cache poisoning\n\n- CVE-2021-41084: Scala-based HTTP interface allows request splitting and response splitting through header names, header values, status reasons, and URIs\n\n- CVE-2018-12116: Javascript-based framework allows request splitting through a path option of an HTTP request\n\n- CVE-2004-2146: Application accepts CRLF in an object ID, allowing HTTP response splitting.\n\n- CVE-2004-1656: Shopping cart allows HTTP response splitting to perform HTML injection via CRLF in a parameter for a url\n\n- CVE-2005-2060: Bulletin board allows response splitting via CRLF in parameter.\n\n- CVE-2004-2512: Response splitting via CRLF in PHPSESSID.\n\n- CVE-2005-1951: e-commerce app allows HTTP response splitting using CRLF in object id parameters\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0268: An Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting') weakness in J-web of Juniper Networks Junos OS leads to buffer overflows, segment faults, or other impacts, which allows an attacker to modify the integrity of the device and exfiltration information from the device without authentication. The weakness can be exploited to facilitate cross-site scripting (XSS), cookie manipulation (modifying session cookies, stealing cookies) and more. This weakness can also be exploited by directing a user to a seemingly legitimate link from the affected site. The attacker requires no special access or permissions to the device to carry out such attacks. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS: 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S11; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S5; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S3; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S5, 18.4R3-S3; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S2, 19.1R3-S2; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S5, 19.2R2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S3, 19.4R2, 19.4R3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S2, 20.1R2. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 18.1R1.\n\n- CVE-2021-28979: SafeNet KeySecure Management Console 8.12.0 is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially-crafted URL to cause the server to return a split response, once the URL is clicked.\n\n- CVE-2021-41084: http4s is an open source scala interface for HTTP. In affected versions http4s is vulnerable to response-splitting or request-splitting attacks when untrusted user input is used to create any of the following fields: Header names (`Header.name`\u00e5), Header values (`Header.value`), Status reason phrases (`Status.reason`), URI paths (`Uri.Path`), URI authority registered names (`URI.RegName`) (through 0.21). This issue has been resolved in versions 0.21.30, 0.22.5, 0.23.4, and 1.0.0-M27 perform the following. As a matter of practice http4s services and client applications should sanitize any user input in the aforementioned fields before returning a request or response to the backend. The carriage return, newline, and null characters are the most threatening.\n\n- CVE-2021-45818: SAFARI Montage 8.7.32 is affected by a CRLF injection vulnerability which can lead to HTTP response splitting.\n\n- CVE-2021-33621: The cgi gem before 0.1.0.2, 0.2.x before 0.2.2, and 0.3.x before 0.3.5 for Ruby allows HTTP response splitting. This is relevant to applications that use untrusted user input either to generate an HTTP response or to create a CGI::Cookie object.\n\n- CVE-2021-40336: A vulnerability exists in the http web interface where the web interface does not validate data in an HTTP header. This causes a possible HTTP response splitting, which if exploited could lead an attacker to channel down harmful code into the user\u2019s web browser, such as to steal the session cookies. Thus, an attacker who successfully makes an MSM user who has already established a session to MSM web interface clicks a forged link to the MSM web interface, e.g., the link is sent per E-Mail, could trick the user into downloading malicious software onto his computer. This issue affects: Hitachi Energy MSM V2.2 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-41437: An HTTP response splitting attack in web application in ASUS RT-AX88U before v3.0.0.4.388.20558 allows an attacker to craft a specific URL that if an authenticated victim visits it, the URL will give access to the cloud storage of the attacker.\n\n- CVE-2022-20772: A vulnerability in Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an HTTP response splitting attack. This vulnerability is due to the failure of the application or its environment to properly sanitize input values. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious HTTP headers, controlling the response body, or splitting the response into multiple responses.\n\n- CVE-2022-35507: A response-header CRLF injection vulnerability in the Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) and Proxmox Mail Gateway (PMG) web interface allows a remote attacker to set cookies for a victim's browser that are longer than the server expects, causing a client-side DoS.

WorkstationST is only deployed in specific, controlled environments rendering attack complexity significantly higher than if the attack were conducted on the software in isolation. WorkstationST v07.09.15 can be found in ControlST v07.09.07 SP8 and greater.\n\n- CVE-2022-42471: An improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers ('HTTP Response Splitting') vulnerability [CWE-113] In FortiWeb version 7.0.0 through 7.0.2, FortiWeb version 6.4.0 through 6.4.2, FortiWeb version 6.3.6 through 6.3.20 may allow an authenticated and remote attacker to inject arbitrary headers.\n\n- CVE-2022-42472: A improper neutralization of crlf sequences in http headers ('http response splitting') in Fortinet FortiOS versions 7.2.0 through 7.2.2, 7.0.0 through 7.0.8, 6.4.0 through 6.4.11, 6.2.0 through 6.2.12, 6.0.0 through 6.0.16, FortiProxy 7.2.0 through 7.2.1, 7.0.0 through 7.0.7, 2.0.0 through 2.0.10, 1.2.0 through 1.2.13, 1.1.0 through 1.1.6 may allow an authenticated and remote attacker to perform an HTTP request splitting attack which gives attackers control of the remaining headers and body of the response.\n\n- CVE-2022-47052: The web interface of the 'Nighthawk R6220 AC1200 Smart Wi-Fi Router' is vulnerable to a CRLF Injection attack that can be leveraged to perform Reflected XSS and HTML Injection. A malicious unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted URL. This affects firmware versions: V1.1.0.112_1.0.1, V1.1.0.114_1.0.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-37499: CRLF vulnerability in Reprise License Manager (RLM) web interface through 14.2BL4 in the password parameter in View License Result function, that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers.\n\n- CVE-2022-32453: HTTP header injection vulnerability in Cybozu Office 10.0.0 to 10.8.5 may allow a remote attacker to obtain and/or alter the data of the product via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2022-3918: A program using FoundationNetworking in swift-corelibs-foundation is potentially vulnerable to CRLF ( ) injection in URLRequest headers. In this vulnerability, a client can insert one or several CRLF sequences into a URLRequest header value. When that request is sent via URLSession to an HTTP server, the server may interpret the content after the CRLF as extra headers, or even a second request. For example, consider a URLRequest to http://example.com/ with the GET method. Suppose we set the URLRequest header \"Foo\" to the value \"Bar Extra-Header: Added GET /other HTTP/1.1\". When this request is sent, it will appear to the server as two requests: GET / HTTP/1.1 Foo: Bar Extra-Header: Added GET /other HTTP/1.1 In this manner, the client is able to inject extra headers and craft an entirely new request to a separate path, despite only making one API call in URLSession. If a developer has total control over the request and its headers, this vulnerability may not pose a threat. However, this vulnerability escalates if un-sanitized user input is placed in header values. If so, a malicious user could inject new headers or requests to an intermediary or backend server. Developers should be especially careful to sanitize user input in this case, or upgrade their version of swift-corelibs-foundation to include the patch below.\n\n- CVE-2022-4188: Insufficient validation of untrusted input in CORS in Google Chrome on Android prior to 108.0.5359.71 allowed a remote attacker to bypass same origin policy via a crafted HTML page.

Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-34359: Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n\n- CVE-2017-16783: server-side template injection in content management server\n\n- CVE-2020-9437: authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection\n\n- CVE-2020-12790: Server-Side Template Injection using a Twig template\n\n- CVE-2021-21244: devops platform allows SSTI\n\n- CVE-2020-4027: bypass of Server-Side Template Injection protection mechanism with macros in Velocity templates\n\n- CVE-2020-26282: web browser proxy server allows Java EL expressions from Server-Side Template Injection\n\n- CVE-2020-1961: SSTI involving mail templates and JEXL expressions\n\n- CVE-2019-19999: product does not use a \"safe\" setting for a FreeMarker configuration, allowing SSTI\n\n- CVE-2018-20465: product allows read of sensitive database username/password variables using server-side template injection\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-25283: An issue was discovered in through SaltStack Salt before 3002.5.

For an example PoC see the referenced GHSL-2021-020.\n\n- CVE-2021-29454: Smarty is a template engine for PHP, facilitating the separation of presentation (HTML/CSS) from application logic. Prior to versions 3.1.42 and 4.0.2, template authors could run arbitrary PHP code by crafting a malicious math string. If a math string was passed through as user provided data to the math function, external users could run arbitrary PHP code by crafting a malicious math string. Users should upgrade to version 3.1.42 or 4.0.2 to receive a patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-32649: October CMS is a self-hosted content management system (CMS) platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. Prior to versions 1.0.473 and 1.1.6, an attacker with \"create, modify and delete website pages\" privileges in the backend is able to execute PHP code by running specially crafted Twig code in the template markup. The issue has been patched in Build 473 (v1.0.473) and v1.1.6. Those unable to upgrade may apply the patch to their installation manually as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-43097: A Server-side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability exists in bbs 5.3 in TemplateManageAction.javawhich could let a malicoius user execute arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-43837: vault-cli is a configurable command-line interface tool (and python library) to interact with Hashicorp Vault. In versions before 3.0.0 vault-cli features the ability for rendering templated values. When a secret starts with the prefix `!template!`, vault-cli interprets the rest of the contents of the secret as a Jinja2 template. Jinja2 is a powerful templating engine and is not designed to safely render arbitrary templates. An attacker controlling a jinja2 template rendered on a machine can trigger arbitrary code, making this a Remote Code Execution (RCE) risk. If the content of the vault can be completely trusted, then this is not a problem. Otherwise, if your threat model includes cases where an attacker can manipulate a secret value read from the vault using vault-cli, then this vulnerability may impact you. In 3.0.0, the code related to interpreting vault templated secrets has been removed entirely. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. For users unable to upgrade a workaround does exist. Using the environment variable `VAULT_CLI_RENDER=false` or the flag `--no-render` (placed between `vault-cli` and the subcommand, e.g. `vault-cli --no-render get-all`) or adding `render: false` to the vault-cli configuration yaml file disables rendering and removes the vulnerability. Using the python library, you can use: `vault_cli.get_client(render=False)` when creating your client to get a client that will not render templated secrets and thus operates securely.\n\n- CVE-2021-46063: MCMS v5.2.5 was discovered to contain a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability via the Template Management module.\n\n- CVE-2021-40219: Bolt CMS <= 4.2 is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.

A malicious user can modify the contents of a `confirmation_token` input during the two-factor authentication process to reference a cache value not associated with the login attempt. In rare cases this can allow a malicious actor to authenticate as a random user in the Panel. The malicious user must target an account with two-factor authentication enabled, and then must provide a correct two-factor authentication token before being authenticated as that user. Due to a validation flaw in the logic handling user authentication during the two-factor authentication process a malicious user can trick the system into loading credentials for an arbitrary user by modifying the token sent to the server. This authentication flaw is present in the `LoginCheckpointController@__invoke` method which handles two-factor authentication for a user. This controller looks for a request input parameter called `confirmation_token` which is expected to be a 64 character random alpha-numeric string that references a value within the Panel's cache containing a `user_id` value. This value is then used to fetch the user that attempted to login, and lookup their two-factor authentication token. Due to the design of this system, any element in the cache that contains only digits could be referenced by a malicious user, and whatever value is stored at that position would be used as the `user_id`. There are a few different areas of the Panel that store values into the cache that are integers, and a user who determines what those cache keys are could pass one of those keys which would cause this code pathway to reference an arbitrary user. At its heart this is a high-risk login bypass vulnerability. However, there are a few additional conditions that must be met in order for this to be successfully executed, notably: 1.) The account referenced by the malicious cache key must have two-factor authentication enabled. An account without two-factor authentication would cause an exception to be triggered by the authentication logic, thusly exiting this authentication flow. 2.) Even if the malicious user is able to reference a valid cache key that references a valid user account with two-factor authentication, they must provide a valid two-factor authentication token. However, due to the design of this endpoint once a valid user account is found with two-factor authentication enabled there is no rate-limiting present, thusly allowing an attacker to brute force combinations until successful. This leads to a third condition that must be met: 3.) For the duration of this attack sequence the cache key being referenced must continue to exist with a valid `user_id` value. Depending on the specific key being used for this attack, this value may disappear quickly, or be changed by other random user interactions on the Panel, outside the control of the attacker. In order to mitigate this vulnerability the underlying authentication logic was changed to use an encrypted session store that the user is therefore unable to control the value of. This completely removed the use of a user-controlled value being used. In addition, the code was audited to ensure this type of vulnerability is not present elsewhere.\n\n- CVE-2021-42338: 4MOSAn GCB Doctor\u2019s login page has improper validation of Cookie, which allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass authentication by code injection in cookie, and arbitrarily manipulate the system or interrupt services by upload and execution of arbitrary files.\n\n- CVE-2021-1541: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an attacker to do the following: Hijack a user session Execute arbitrary commands as a root user on the underlying operating system Conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack Conduct an HTML injection attack For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-41317: XSS Hunter Express before 2021-09-17 does not properly enforce authentication requirements for paths.\n\n- CVE-2021-29012: DMA Softlab Radius Manager 4.4.0 assigns the same session cookie to every admin session.

As a workaround, one may disable basic authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-21378: Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In Envoy version 1.17.0 an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list when Envoy's JWT Authentication filter is configured with the `allow_missing` requirement under `requires_any` due to a mistake in implementation. Envoy's JWT Authentication filter can be configured with the `allow_missing` requirement that will be satisfied if JWT is missing (JwtMissed error) and fail if JWT is presented or invalid. Due to a mistake in implementation, a JwtUnknownIssuer error was mistakenly converted to JwtMissed when `requires_any` was configured. So if `allow_missing` was configured under `requires_any`, an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list. Integrity may be impacted depending on configuration if the JWT token is used to protect against writes or modifications. This regression was introduced on 2020/11/12 in PR 13839 which fixed handling `allow_missing` under RequiresAny in a JwtRequirement (see issue 13458). The AnyVerifier aggregates the children verifiers' results into a final status where JwtMissing is the default error. However, a JwtUnknownIssuer was mistakenly treated the same as a JwtMissing error and the resulting final aggregation was the default JwtMissing. As a result, `allow_missing` would allow a JWT token with an unknown issuer status. This is fixed in version 1.17.1 by PR 15194. The fix works by preferring JwtUnknownIssuer over a JwtMissing error, fixing the accidental conversion and bypass with `allow_missing`. A user could detect whether a bypass occurred if they have Envoy logs enabled with debug verbosity. Users can enable component level debug logs for JWT. The JWT filter logs will indicate that there is a request with a JWT token and a failure that the JWT token is missing.\n\n- CVE-2021-21513: Dell EMC OpenManage Server Administrator (OMSA) version 9.5 Microsoft Windows installations with Distributed Web Server (DWS) enabled configuration contains an authentication bypass vulnerability.

Due to a bug in ASF code `POST /Api/ASF` ASF API endpoint responsible for updating global ASF config incorrectly removed `IPCPassword` from the resulting config when the caller did not specify it explicitly. Due to the above, it was possible for the user to accidentally remove `IPCPassword` security measure from his IPC interface when updating global ASF config, which exists as part of global config update functionality in ASF-ui. Removal of `IPCPassword` possesses a security risk, as unauthorized users may in result access the IPC interface after such modification. The issue is patched in ASF V5.1.2.4 and future versions. We recommend to manually verify that `IPCPassword` is specified after update, and if not, set it accordingly. In default settings, ASF is configured to allow IPC access from `localhost` only and should not affect majority of users.\n\n- CVE-2021-3282: HashiCorp Vault Enterprise 1.6.0 & 1.6.1 allowed the `remove-peer` raft operator command to be executed against DR secondaries without authentication. Fixed in 1.6.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-34675: Basix NEX-Forms through 7.8.7 allows authentication bypass for stored PDF reports.\n\n- CVE-2021-34676: Basix NEX-Forms through 7.8.7 allows authentication bypass for Excel report generation.\n\n- CVE-2021-35941: Western Digital WD My Book Live (2.x and later) and WD My Book Live Duo (all versions) have an administrator API that can perform a system factory restore without authentication, as exploited in the wild in June 2021, a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-18472.\n\n- CVE-2021-37415: Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus before 11302 is vulnerable to authentication bypass that allows a few REST-API URLs without authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-37420: Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus before 6112 is vulnerable to mail spoofing.\n\n- CVE-2021-37624: FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. Prior to version 1.10.7, FreeSWITCH does not authenticate SIP MESSAGE requests, leading to spam and message spoofing. By default, SIP requests of the type MESSAGE (RFC 3428) are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. MESSAGE requests are relayed to SIP user agents registered with the FreeSWITCH server without requiring any authentication. Although this behaviour can be changed by setting the `auth-messages` parameter to `true`, it is not the default setting. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to send SIP MESSAGE messages to any SIP user agent that is registered with the server without requiring authentication. Additionally, since no authentication is required, chat messages can be spoofed to appear to come from trusted entities. Therefore, abuse can lead to spam and enable social engineering, phishing and similar attacks. This issue is patched in version 1.10.7. Maintainers recommend that this SIP message type is authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to be explicitly set the `auth-messages` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-38412: Properly formatted POST requests to multiple resources on the HTTP and HTTPS web servers of the Digi PortServer TS 16 Rack device do not require authentication or authentication tokens. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to enable the SNMP service and manipulate the community strings to achieve further control in.\n\n- CVE-2021-41157: FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. By default, SIP requests of the type SUBSCRIBE are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to subscribe to user agent event notifications without the need to authenticate. This abuse poses privacy concerns and might lead to social engineering or similar attacks. For example, attackers may be able to monitor the status of target SIP extensions. Although this issue was fixed in version v1.10.6, installations upgraded to the fixed version of FreeSWITCH from an older version, may still be vulnerable if the configuration is not updated accordingly. Software upgrades do not update the configuration by default. SIP SUBSCRIBE messages should be authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to explicitly set the `auth-subscriptions` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2020-25566: In SapphireIMS 5.0, it is possible to take over an account by sending a request to the Save_Password form as shown in POC. Notice that we do not require a JSESSIONID in this request and can reset any user\u2019s password by changing the username to that user and password to base64(desired password).\n\n- CVE-2021-30167: The manage users profile services of the network camera device allows an authenticated.

These special elements can carry control implications. If product does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < (\"less than\") as meaning \"read input from a file\".\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2001-0677: Read arbitrary files from mail client by providing a special MIME header that is internally used to store pathnames for attachments.\n\n- CVE-2000-0703: Setuid program does not cleanse special escape sequence before sending data to a mail program, causing the mail program to process those sequences.\n\n- CVE-2003-0020: Multi-channel issue.

It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-5184: API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n\n- CVE-1999-0067: Canonical example of OS command injection.

If the token cannot match, the engine \"backtracks\" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.\n Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:\n\n\n  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.\n\n  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.\n\n  - The input can be long enough.\n\n Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. \n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-5243: server allows ReDOS with crafted User-Agent strings, due to overlapping capture groups that cause excessive backtracking.\n\n- CVE-2021-21317: npm package for user-agent parser prone to ReDoS due to overlapping capture groups\n\n- CVE-2019-16215: Markdown parser uses inefficient regex when processing a message, allowing users to cause CPU consumption and delay preventing processing of other messages.\n\n- CVE-2019-6785: Long string in a version control product allows DoS due to an inefficient regex.\n\n- CVE-2019-12041: Javascript code allows ReDoS via a long string due to excessive backtracking.\n\n- CVE-2015-8315: ReDoS when parsing time.\n\n- CVE-2015-8854: ReDoS when parsing documents.\n\n- CVE-2017-16021: ReDoS when validating URL.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-32740: Addressable is an alternative implementation to the URI implementation that is part of Ruby's standard library. An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability exists after version 2.3.0 through version 2.7.0. Within the URI template implementation in Addressable, a maliciously crafted template may result in uncontrolled resource consumption, leading to denial of service when matched against a URI. In typical usage, templates would not normally be read from untrusted user input, but nonetheless, no previous security advisory for Addressable has cautioned against doing this. Users of the parsing capabilities in Addressable but not the URI template capabilities are unaffected. The vulnerability is patched in version 2.8.0. As a workaround, only create Template objects from trusted sources that have been validated not to produce catastrophic backtracking.\n\n- CVE-2021-32763: OpenProject is open-source, web-based project management software. In versions prior to 11.3.3, the `MessagesController` class of OpenProject has a `quote` method that implements the logic behind the Quote button in the discussion forums, and it uses a regex to strip `<pre>` tags from the message being quoted. The `(.|\\\\s)` part can match a space character in two ways, so an unterminated `<pre>` tag containing `n` spaces causes Ruby's regex engine to backtrack to try 2<sup>n</sup> states in the NFA. This will result in a Regular Expression Denial of Service. The issue is fixed in OpenProject 11.3.3. As a workaround, one may install the patch manually.\n\n- CVE-2021-32838: Flask-RESTX (pypi package flask-restx) is a community driven fork of Flask-RESTPlus.

The maintainers found the patch for CVE-2021-43838 in jsx-slack v4.5.1 is insufficient tfor protection from a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. If an attacker can put a lot of JSX elements into `<blockquote>` tag _with including multibyte characters_, an internal regular expression for escaping characters may consume an excessive amount of computing resources. v4.5.1 passes the test against ASCII characters but misses the case of multibyte characters. jsx-slack v4.5.2 has updated regular expressions for escaping blockquote characters to prevent catastrophic backtracking. It is also including an updated test case to confirm rendering multiple tags in `<blockquote>` with multibyte characters.\n\n- CVE-2021-3733: There's a flaw in urllib's AbstractBasicAuthHandler class. An attacker who controls a malicious HTTP server that an HTTP client (such as web browser) connects to, could trigger a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDOS) during an authentication request with a specially crafted payload that is sent by the server to the client. The greatest threat that this flaw poses is to application availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-38244: A regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability exits in cbioportal 3.6.21 and older via a POST request to /ProteinArraySignificanceTest.json.\n\n- CVE-2021-39917: An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 12.9 before 14.3.6, all versions starting from 14.4 before 14.4.4, all versions starting from 14.5 before 14.5.2. A regular expression related to quick actions features was susceptible to catastrophic backtracking that could cause a DOS attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-43854: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a suite of open source Python modules, data sets, and tutorials supporting research and development in Natural Language Processing. Versions prior to 3.6.5 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. The vulnerability is present in PunktSentenceTokenizer, sent_tokenize and word_tokenize. Any users of this class, or these two functions, are vulnerable to the ReDoS attack. In short, a specifically crafted long input to any of these vulnerable functions will cause them to take a significant amount of execution time. If your program relies on any of the vulnerable functions for tokenizing unpredictable user input, then we would strongly recommend upgrading to a version of NLTK without the vulnerability. For users unable to upgrade the execution time can be bounded by limiting the maximum length of an input to any of the vulnerable functions. Our recommendation is to implement such a limit.\n\n- CVE-2021-23354: The package printf before 0.6.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the regex string /\\\\%(?:\\\\(([\\\\w_.]+)\\\\)|([1-9]\\\\d*)\\\\$)?([0 +\\\\-\\\\]*)(\\\\*|\\\\d+)?(\\\\.)?(\\\\*|\\\\d+)?[hlL]?([\\\\%bscdeEfFgGioOuxX])/g in lib/printf.js.

In affected versions Zulip allows organization administrators on a server to configure \"linkifiers\" that automatically create links from messages that users send, detected via arbitrary regular expressions. Malicious organization administrators could subject the server to a denial-of-service via regular expression complexity attacks; most simply, by configuring a quadratic-time regular expression in a linkifier, and sending messages that exploited it. A regular expression attempted to parse the user-provided regexes to verify that they were safe from ReDoS -- this was both insufficient, as well as _itself_ subject to ReDoS if the organization administrator entered a sufficiently complex invalid regex. Affected users should [upgrade to the just-released Zulip 4.7](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release), or [`main`](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-from-a-git-repository).\n\n- CVE-2021-41817: Date.parse in the date gem through 3.2.0 for Ruby allows ReDoS (regular expression Denial of Service) via a long string.

The exploitation of this vulnerability could be triggered via the parse function.\n\n- CVE-2022-21681: Marked is a markdown parser and compiler. Prior to version 4.0.10, the regular expression `inline.reflinkSearch` may cause catastrophic backtracking against some strings and lead to a denial of service (DoS). Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version of marked and does not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is patched in version 4.0.10. As a workaround, avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run marked on a worker thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources.\n\n- CVE-2022-24373: The package react-native-reanimated before 3.0.0-rc.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to improper usage of regular expression in the parser of Colors.js.\n\n- CVE-2022-24713: regex is an implementation of regular expressions for the Rust language. The regex crate features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service attacks caused by untrusted regexes, or untrusted input matched by trusted regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered part of the crate's API. Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing, and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to services accepting user-controlled, untrusted regexes. All versions of the regex crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this issue. The fix is include starting from regex 1.5.5. All users accepting user-controlled regexes are recommended to upgrade immediately to the latest version of the regex crate. Unfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are practically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability. Because of this, it us not recommend to deny known problematic regexes.\n\n- CVE-2022-25598: Apache DolphinScheduler user registration is vulnerable to Regular express Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks, Apache DolphinScheduler users should upgrade to version 2.0.5 or higher.\n\n- CVE-2022-25758: All versions of package scss-tokenizer are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the loadAnnotation() function, due to the usage of insecure regex.\n\n- CVE-2022-25844: The package angular after 1.7.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) by providing a custom locale rule that makes it possible to assign the parameter in posPre: ' '.repeat() of NUMBER_FORMATS.PATTERNS[1].posPre with a very high value. **Note:** 1) This package has been deprecated and is no longer maintained. 2) The vulnerable versions are 1.7.0 and higher.\n\n- CVE-2022-25858: The package terser before 4.8.1, from 5.0.0 and before 5.14.2 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to insecure usage of regular expressions.\n\n- CVE-2022-25887: The package sanitize-html before 2.7.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to insecure global regular expression replacement logic of HTML comment removal.\n\n- CVE-2022-25918: The package shescape from 1.5.10 and before 1.6.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the escape function in index.js, due to the usage of insecure regex in the escapeArgBash function.\n\n- CVE-2022-29158: Apache OFBiz up to version 18.12.05 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the way it handles URLs provided by external, unauthenticated users. Upgrade to 18.12.06 or apply patches at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-12599\n\n- CVE-2022-29167: Hawk is an HTTP authentication scheme providing mechanisms for making authenticated HTTP requests with partial cryptographic verification of the request and response, covering the HTTP method, request URI, host, and optionally the request payload. Hawk used a regular expression to parse `Host` HTTP header (`Hawk.utils.parseHost()`), which was subject to regular expression DoS attack - meaning each added character in the attacker's input increases the computation time exponentially. `parseHost()` was patched in `9.0.1` to use built-in `URL` class to parse hostname instead. `Hawk.authenticate()` accepts `options` argument. If that contains `host` and `port`, those would be used instead of a call to `utils.parseHost()`.\n\n- CVE-2022-29169: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions starting with 2.2 and prior to 2.3.19, 2.4.7, and 2.5.0-beta.2 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. By using specific a RegularExpression, an attacker can cause denial of service for the bbb-html5 service. The useragent library performs checking of device by parsing the input of User-Agent header and lets it go through lookupUserAgent() (alias of useragent.lookup() ). This function handles input by regexing and attackers can abuse that by providing some ReDos payload using `SmartWatch`. The maintainers removed `htmlclient/useragent` from versions 2.3.19, 2.4.7, and 2.5.0-beta.2. As a workaround, disable NginX forwarding the requests to the handler according to the directions in the GitHub Security Advisory.\n\n- CVE-2022-31129: moment is a JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates. Affected versions of moment were found to use an inefficient parsing algorithm. Specifically using string-to-date parsing in moment (more specifically rfc2822 parsing, which is tried by default) has quadratic (N^2) complexity on specific inputs. Users may notice a noticeable slowdown is observed with inputs above 10k characters. Users who pass user-provided strings without sanity length checks to moment constructor are vulnerable to (Re)DoS attacks. The problem is patched in 2.29.4, the patch can be applied to all affected versions with minimal tweaking. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should consider limiting date lengths accepted from user input.\n\n- CVE-2022-31147: The jQuery Validation Plugin (jquery-validation) provides drop-in validation for forms. Versions of jquery-validation prior to 1.19.5 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) when an attacker is able to supply arbitrary input to the url2 method. This is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-43306. Users should upgrade to version 1.19.5 to receive a patch.\n\n- CVE-2022-31781: Apache Tapestry up to version 5.8.1 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the way it handles Content Types.

This issue affects Apache ManifoldCF version 2.23 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-24832: GoCD is an open source a continuous delivery server. The bundled gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin included with the GoCD Server fails to correctly escape special characters when using the username to construct LDAP queries. While this does not directly allow arbitrary LDAP data exfiltration, it can allow an existing LDAP-authenticated GoCD user with malicious intent to construct and execute malicious queries, allowing them to deduce facts about other users or entries within the LDAP database (e.g alternate fields, usernames, hashed passwords etc) through brute force mechanisms. This only affects users who have a working LDAP authorization configuration enabled on their GoCD server, and only is exploitable by users authenticating using such an LDAP configuration. This issue has been fixed in GoCD 22.1.0, which is bundled with gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin v2.2.0-144.\n\n- CVE-2022-22975: An issue was discovered in the Pinniped Supervisor with either LADPIdentityProvider or ActiveDirectoryIdentityProvider resources. An attack would involve the malicious user changing the common name (CN) of their user entry on the LDAP or AD server to include special characters, which could be used to perform LDAP query injection on the Supervisor's LDAP query which determines their Kubernetes group membership.\n\n- CVE-2022-31088: LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups, DHCP settings) stored in an LDAP directory.

The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker. Some kinds of sensitive information include:\n\n\n  - private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details\n\n  - system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages\n\n  - business secrets and intellectual property\n\n  - network status and configuration\n\n  - the product's own code or internal state\n\n  - metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers\n\n  - indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider\n\nInformation might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected. These parties include:\n\n  - the product's own users\n\n  - people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users\n\n  - the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates\n\n  - the developer\n\nInformation exposures can occur in different ways:\n\n  - the code  **explicitly inserts**  sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been \"scrubbed\" or \"sanitized\"\n\n  - a different weakness or mistake  **indirectly inserts**  the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.\n\n  - the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are  **unintentionally made accessible**  to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.\n\nIt is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read. CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store, transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-31162: Rust library leaks Oauth client details in application debug logs\n\n- CVE-2021-25476: Digital Rights Management (DRM) capability for mobile platform leaks pointer information, simplifying ASLR bypass\n\n- CVE-2001-1483: Enumeration of valid usernames based on inconsistent responses\n\n- CVE-2001-1528: Account number enumeration via inconsistent responses.\n\n- CVE-2004-2150: User enumeration via discrepancies in error messages.\n\n- CVE-2005-1205: Telnet protocol allows servers to obtain sensitive environment information from clients.\n\n- CVE-2002-1725: Script calls phpinfo(), revealing system configuration to web user\n\n- CVE-2002-0515: Product sets a different TTL when a port is being filtered than when it is not being filtered, which allows remote attackers to identify filtered ports by comparing TTLs.\n\n- CVE-2004-0778: Version control system allows remote attackers to determine the existence of arbitrary files and directories via the -X command for an alternate history file, which causes different error messages to be returned.\n\n- CVE-2000-1117: Virtual machine allows malicious web site operators to determine the existence of files on the client by measuring delays in the execution of the getSystemResource method.\n\n- CVE-2003-0190: Product immediately sends an error message when a user does not exist, which allows remote attackers to determine valid usernames via a timing attack.\n\n- CVE-2008-2049: POP3 server reveals a password in an error message after multiple APOP commands are sent.

In affected versions users who use [`HttpAuthMiddleware`](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth) (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for Splash authentication will have any non-Splash request expose your credentials to the request target. This includes `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`. Upgrade to scrapy-splash 0.8.0 and use the new `SPLASH_USER` and `SPLASH_PASS` settings instead to set your Splash authentication credentials safely. If you cannot upgrade, set your Splash request credentials on a per-request basis, [using the `splash_headers` request parameter](https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash/tree/0.8.x#http-basic-auth), instead of defining them globally using the [`HttpAuthMiddleware`](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth). Alternatively, make sure all your requests go through Splash. That includes disabling the [robots.txt middleware](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#topics-dlmw-robots).\n\n- CVE-2021-32720: Sylius is an Open Source eCommerce platform on top of Symfony. In versions of Sylius prior to 1.9.5 and 1.10.0-RC.1, part of the details (order ID, order number, items total, and token value) of all placed orders were exposed to unauthorized users. If exploited properly, a few additional information like the number of items in the cart and the date of the shipping may be fetched as well. This data seems to not be crucial nor is personal data, however, could be used for sociotechnical attacks or may expose a few details about shop condition to the third parties. The data possible to aggregate are the number of processed orders or their value in the moment of time. The problem has been patched at Sylius 1.9.5 and 1.10.0-RC.1. There are a few workarounds for the vulnerability. The first possible solution is to hide the problematic endpoints behind the firewall from not logged in users. This would put only the order list under the firewall and allow only authorized users to access it. Once a user is authorized, it will have access to theirs orders only. The second possible solution is to decorate the `\\\\Sylius\\\\Bundle\\\\ApiBundle\\\\Doctrine\\\\QueryCollectionExtension\\\\OrdersByLoggedInUserExtension` and throw `Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Security\\\\Core\\\\Exception\\\\AccessDeniedException` if the class is executed for unauthorized user.\n\n- CVE-2021-39192: Ghost is a Node.js content management system.

Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nXSS: A common abbreviation for Cross-Site Scripting.\nHTML Injection: Used as a synonym of stored (Type 2) XSS.\nCSS: In the early years after initial discovery of XSS, \"CSS\" was a commonly-used acronym. However, this would cause confusion with \"Cascading Style Sheets,\" so usage of this acronym has declined significantly.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nCanPrecede -> CWE-494\nPeerOf -> CWE-352\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThere can be a close relationship between XSS and CSRF (CWE-352). An attacker might use CSRF in order to trick the victim into submitting requests to the server in which the requests contain an XSS payload. A well-known example of this was the Samy worm on MySpace [REF-956]. The worm used XSS to insert malicious HTML sequences into a user's profile and add the attacker as a MySpace friend. MySpace friends of that victim would then execute the payload to modify their own profiles, causing the worm to propagate exponentially. Since the victims did not intentionally insert the malicious script themselves, CSRF was a root cause.\n\n\n**[Applicable Platform]** \n\nXSS flaws are very common in web applications, since they require a great deal of developer discipline to avoid them.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-25926:** Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.\n- **CVE-2021-25963:** Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\n- **CVE-2021-1879:** Universal XSS in mobile operating system, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\n HTTP agents or components may include a web server, load balancer, reverse proxy, web caching proxy, application firewall, web browser, etc. Regardless of the role, they are expected to maintain coherent, consistent HTTP communication state across all components. However, including unexpected data in an HTTP header allows an attacker to specify the entirety of the HTTP message that is rendered by the client HTTP agent (e.g., web browser) or back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web server), whether the message is part of a request or a response. \n\n\nWhen an HTTP request contains unexpected CR and LF characters, the server may respond with an output stream that is interpreted as \"splitting\" the stream into two different HTTP messages instead of one. CR is carriage return, also given by %0d or \\r, and LF is line feed, also given by %0a or \\n.\n\n\nIn addition to CR and LF characters, other valid/RFC compliant special characters and unique character encodings can be utilized, such as HT (horizontal tab, also given by %09 or \\t) and SP (space, also given as + sign or %20).\n\n\nThese types of unvalidated and unexpected data in HTTP message headers allow an attacker to control the second \"split\" message to mount attacks such as server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and cache poisoning attacks.\n\n\nHTTP response splitting weaknesses may be present when:\n\n\n  1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request.\n\n  1. The data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without neutralizing malicious characters that can be interpreted as separator characters for headers.\n\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nHTTP Request Splitting\nHTTP Response Splitting\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-93\nCanPrecede -> CWE-79\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nChildOf -> CWE-436\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-15811:** Chain: Proxy uses a substring search instead of parsing the Transfer-Encoding header (CWE-697), allowing request splitting (CWE-113) and cache poisoning\n- **CVE-2021-41084:** Scala-based HTTP interface allows request splitting and response splitting through header names, header values, status reasons, and URIs\n- **CVE-2018-12116:** Javascript-based framework allows request splitting through a path option of an HTTP request\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany web applications use template engines that allow developers to insert externally-influenced values into free text or messages in order to generate a full web page, document, message, etc. Such engines include Twig, Jinja2, Pug, Java Server Pages, FreeMarker, Velocity, ColdFusion, Smarty, and many others - including PHP itself. Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nServer-Side Template Injection / SSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a server.\nClient-Side Template Injection / CSTI: This term is used for injection into template engines being used by a client.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-94\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Since expression languages are often used in templating languages, there may be some overlap with CWE-917 (Expression Language Injection). XSS (CWE-79) is also co-located with template injection.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The interrelationships and differences between CWE-917 and CWE-1336 need to be further clarified.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-34359:** Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n- **CVE-2017-16783:** server-side template injection in content management server\n- **CVE-2020-9437:** authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nPrivacy violation\nPrivacy leak\nPrivacy leakage\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-200\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

However, because privacy is treated with such importance due to regulations and other factors, and it may be useful for weakness-finding tools to highlight capabilities that detect personal private information instead of system information, it is not clear whether - and how - this entry should be deprecated.\n\n**[Other]** \n\nThere are many types of sensitive information that products must protect from attackers, including system data, communications, configuration, business secrets, intellectual property, and an individual's personal (private) information. Private personal information may include a password, phone number, geographic location, personal messages, credit card number, etc. Private information is important to consider whether the person is a user of the product, or part of a data set that is processed by the product. An exposure of private information does not necessarily prevent the product from working properly, and in fact the exposure might be intended by the developer, e.g. as part of data sharing with other organizations. However, the exposure of personal private information can still be undesirable or explicitly prohibited by law or regulation.\n\n\nSome types of private information include:\n\n\n  - Government identifiers, such as Social Security Numbers\n\n  - Contact information, such as home addresses and telephone numbers\n\n  - Geographic location - where the user is (or was)\n\n  - Employment history\n\n  - Financial data - such as credit card numbers, salary, bank accounts, and debts\n\n  - Pictures, video, or audio\n\n  - Behavioral patterns - such as web surfing history, when certain activities are performed, etc.\n\n  - Relationships (and types of relationships) with others - family, friends, contacts, etc.\n\n  - Communications - e-mail addresses, private messages, text messages, chat logs, etc.\n\n  - Health - medical conditions, insurance status, prescription records\n\n  - Account passwords and other credentials\n\nSome of this information may be characterized as PII (Personally Identifiable Information), Protected Health Information (PHI), etc. Categories of private information may overlap or vary based on the intended usage or the policies and practices of a particular industry.\n\nSometimes data that is not labeled as private can have a privacy implication in a different context. For example, student identification numbers are usually not considered private because there is no explicit and publicly-available mapping to an individual student's personal information. However, if a school generates identification numbers based on student social security numbers, then the identification numbers should be considered private.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDenylist / Deny List: This is used by CWE and CAPEC instead of other commonly-used terms. Its counterpart is allowlist.\nBlocklist / Block List: This is often used by security tools such as firewalls, email or web gateways, proxies, etc.\nBlacklist / Black List: This term is frequently used, but usage has been declining as organizations have started to adopt other terms.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-693\nChildOf -> CWE-1023\nCanPrecede -> CWE-79\nCanPrecede -> CWE-78\nCanPrecede -> CWE-434\nCanPrecede -> CWE-98\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** \n\nMultiple interpretation errors can indirectly introduce inputs that should be disallowed. For example, a list of dangerous shell metacharacters might not include a metacharacter that only has meaning in one particular shell, not all of them; or a check for XSS manipulations might ignore an unusual construct that is supported by one web browser, but not others.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the \"\\\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.\n- **CVE-2008-2309:** product uses a denylist to identify potentially dangerous content, allowing attacker to bypass a warning\n- **CVE-2005-2782:** PHP remote file inclusion in web application that filters \"http\" and \"https\" URLs, but not \"ftp\".\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-287: Improper Authentication\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nWhen an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nauthentification: An alternate term is \"authentification\", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.\nAuthN: \"AuthN\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authentication\" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from \"AuthZ,\" which is an abbreviation of \"authorization.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\nAuthC: \"AuthC\" is used as an abbreviation of \"authentication,\" but it appears to used less frequently than \"AuthN.\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n**Comments:** Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.\n\n**[Maintenance]** The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the \"Mapping CWE to 62443\" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication\n- **CVE-2022-36436:** Python-based authentication proxy does not enforce password authentication during the initial handshake, allowing the client to bypass authentication by specifying a 'None' authentication type.\n- **CVE-2022-30034:** Chain: Web UI for a Python RPC framework does not use regex anchors to validate user login emails (CWE-777), potentially allowing bypass of OAuth (CWE-1390).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-287\nChildOf -> CWE-287\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-31260:** Chain: a digital asset management program has an undisclosed backdoor in the legacy version of a PHP script (CWE-912) that could allow an unauthenticated user to export metadata (CWE-306)\n- **CVE-2022-29951:** TCP-based protocol in Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) has no authentication.\n- **CVE-2022-29952:** Condition Monitor firmware uses a protocol that does not require authentication.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could be interpreted as control elements or syntactic markers when they are sent to a downstream component.\n\n### Extended Description\nMost languages and protocols have their own special elements such as characters and reserved words. These special elements can carry control implications. If product does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < (\"less than\") as meaning \"read input from a file\".\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-707\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This weakness can be related to interpretation conflicts or interaction errors in intermediaries (such as proxies or application firewalls) when the intermediary's model of an endpoint does not account for protocol-specific special elements.\n\n**[Relationship]** See this entry's children for different types of special elements that have been observed at one point or another. However, it can be difficult to find suitable CVE examples. In an attempt to be complete, CWE includes some types that do not have any associated observed example.\n\n**[Research Gap]** This weakness is probably under-studied for proprietary or custom formats. It is likely that these issues are fairly common in applications that use their own custom format for configuration files, logs, meta-data, messaging, etc. They would only be found by accident or with a focused effort based on an understanding of the format.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2001-0677:** Read arbitrary files from mail client by providing a special MIME header that is internally used to store pathnames for attachments.\n- **CVE-2000-0703:** Setuid program does not cleanse special escape sequence before sending data to a mail program, causing the mail program to process those sequences.\n- **CVE-2003-0020:** Multi-channel issue. Terminal escape sequences not filtered from log files.\n\n",

Due to a non-RFC-compliant check of the available authentication methods in the client-side SSH code, it is possible for an SSH server to change the login process in its favor. This attack can bypass additional security measures such as FIDO2 tokens or SSH-Askpass. Thus, it allows an attacker to abuse a forwarded agent for logging on to another server unnoticed.\n\n- CVE-2021-3827: A flaw was found in keycloak, where the default ECP binding flow allows other authentication flows to be bypassed. By exploiting this behavior, an attacker can bypass the MFA authentication by sending a SOAP request with an AuthnRequest and Authorization header with the user's credentials. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-41638: The authentication checks of the MELAG FTP Server in version 2.2.0.4 are incomplete, which allows a remote attacker to access local files only by using a valid username.\n\n- CVE-2022-0910: A downgrade from two-factor authentication to one-factor authentication vulnerability in the CGI program of Zyxel USG/ZyWALL series firmware versions 4.32 through 4.71, USG FLEX series firmware versions 4.50 through 5.21, ATP series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.21, and VPN series firmware versions 4.32 through 5.21, that could allow an authenticated attacker to bypass the second authentication phase to connect the IPsec VPN server even though the two-factor authentication (2FA) was enabled.\n\n- CVE-2022-1049: A flaw was found in the Pacemaker configuration tool (pcs). The pcs daemon was allowing expired accounts, and accounts with expired passwords to login when using PAM authentication. Therefore, unprivileged expired accounts that have been denied access could still login.\n\n- CVE-2022-1426: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 12.6 before 14.8.6, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.4, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.1. GitLab was not correctly authenticating a user that had some certain amount of information which allowed an user to authenticate without a personal access token.\n\n- CVE-2022-1955: Session 1.13.0 allows an attacker with physical access to the victim's device to bypass the application's password/pin lock to access user data. This is possible due to lack of adequate security controls to prevent dynamic code manipulation.\n\n- CVE-2022-20662: A vulnerability in the smart card login authentication of Cisco Duo for macOS could allow an unauthenticated attacker with physical access to bypass authentication. This vulnerability exists because the assigned user of a smart card is not properly matched with the authenticating user. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by configuring a smart card login to bypass Duo authentication. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use any personal identity verification (PIV) smart card for authentication, even if the smart card is not assigned to the authenticating user.\n\n- CVE-2022-22956: VMware Workspace ONE Access has two authentication bypass vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-22955 & CVE-2022-22956) in the OAuth2 ACS framework. A malicious actor may bypass the authentication mechanism and execute any operation due to exposed endpoints in the authentication framework.\n\n- CVE-2022-23501: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. In versions prior to 8.7.49, 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1 TYPO3 is vulnerable to Improper Authentication. Restricting frontend login to specific users, organized in different storage folders (partitions), can be bypassed. A potential attacker might use this ambiguity in usernames to get access to a different account - however, credentials must be known to the adversary. This issue is patched in versions 8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-23600: fleet is an open source device management, built on osquery. Versions prior to 4.9.1 expose a limited ability to spoof SAML authentication with missing audience verification. This impacts deployments using SAML SSO in two specific cases: 1. A malicious or compromised Service Provider (SP) could reuse the SAML response to log into Fleet as a user -- only if the user has an account with the same email in Fleet, _and_ the user signs into the malicious SP via SAML SSO from the same Identity Provider (IdP) configured with Fleet. 2. A user with an account in Fleet could reuse a SAML response intended for another SP to log into Fleet. This is only a concern if the user is blocked from Fleet in the IdP, but continues to have an account in Fleet. If the user is blocked from the IdP entirely, this cannot be exploited. Fleet 4.9.1 resolves this issue. Users unable to upgrade should: Reduce the length of sessions on your IdP to reduce the window for malicious re-use, Limit the amount of SAML Service Providers/Applications used by user accounts with access to Fleet, and When removing access to Fleet in the IdP, delete the Fleet user from Fleet as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24259: An incorrect check in the component cdr.php of Voipmonitor GUI before v24.96 allows unauthenticated attackers to escalate privileges via a crafted request.\n\n- CVE-2022-24883: FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Prior to version 2.7.0, server side authentication against a `SAM` file might be successful for invalid credentials if the server has configured an invalid `SAM` file path. FreeRDP based clients are not affected. RDP server implementations using FreeRDP to authenticate against a `SAM` file are affected. Version 2.7.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, use custom authentication via `HashCallback` and/or ensure the `SAM` database path configured is valid and the application has file handles left.\n\n- CVE-2022-24885: Nextcloud Android app is the Android client for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. Prior to version 3.19.1, users can bypass a lock on the Nextcloud app on an Android device by repeatedly reopening the app. Version 3.19.1 contains a fix for the problem. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-24976: Atheme IRC Services before 7.2.12, when used in conjunction with InspIRCd, allows authentication bypass by ending an IRC handshake at a certain point during a challenge-response login sequence.\n\n- CVE-2022-2533: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 12.10 before 15.1.6, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.4, all versions starting from 15.3 before 15.3.2. GitLab was not performing correct authentication with some Package Registries when IP address restrictions were configured, allowing an attacker already in possession of a valid Deploy Token to misuse it from any location.\n\n- CVE-2022-2553: The authfile directive in the booth config file is ignored, preventing use of authentication in communications from node to node. As a result, nodes that do not have the correct authentication key are not prevented from communicating with other nodes in the cluster.\n\n- CVE-2022-2572: In affected versions of Octopus Server where access is managed by an external authentication provider, it was possible that the API key/keys of a disabled/deleted user were still valid after the access was revoked.\n\n- CVE-2022-26504: Improper authentication in Veeam Backup & Replication 9.5U3, 9.5U4,10.x and 11.x component used for Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) allows attackers execute arbitrary code via Veeam.Backup.PSManager.exe\n\n- CVE-2022-26562: An issue in provider/libserver/ECKrbAuth.cpp of Kopano Core <= v11.0.2.51 contains an issue which allows attackers to authenticate even if the user account or password is expired. It also exists in the predecessor Zarafa Collaboration Platform (ZCP) in provider/libserver/ECPamAuth.cpp of Zarafa >= 6.30 (introduced between 6.30.0 RC1e and 6.30.8 final).\n\n- CVE-2022-3477: The tagDiv Composer WordPress plugin before 3.5, required by the Newspaper WordPress theme before 12.1 and Newsmag WordPress theme before 5.2.2, does not properly implement the Facebook login feature, allowing unauthenticated attackers to login as any user by just knowing their email address\n\n- CVE-2022-36106: TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released under the GNU GPL. It has been discovered that the expiration time of a password reset link for TYPO3 backend users has never been evaluated. As a result, a password reset link could be used to perform a password reset even if the default expiry time of two hours has been exceeded. Update to TYPO3 version 10.4.32 or 11.5.16 that fix the problem. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36412: In Zoho ManageEngine SupportCenter Plus before 11023, V3 API requests are vulnerable to authentication bypass. (An API request may, in effect, be executed with the credentials of a user who authenticated in the past.)\n\n- CVE-2022-39238: Arvados is an open source platform for managing and analyzing biomedical big data. In versions prior to 2.4.3, when using Portable Authentication Modules (PAM) for user authentication, if a user presented valid credentials but the account is disabled or otherwise not allowed to access the host (such as an expired password), it would still be accepted for access to Arvados. Other authentication methods (LDAP, OpenID Connect) supported by Arvados are not affected by this flaw. This issue is patched in version 2.4.3. Workaround for this issue is to migrate to a different authentication method supported by Arvados, such as LDAP.\n\n- CVE-2022-39263: `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier (email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration. The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available. Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding.\n\n- CVE-2022-39355: Discourse Patreon enables syncronization between Discourse Groups and Patreon rewards. On sites with Patreon login enabled, an improper authentication vulnerability could be used to take control of a victim's forum account. This vulnerability is patched in commit number 846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e of the discourse-patreon plugin. Out of an abundance of caution, any Discourse accounts which have logged in with an unverified-email Patreon account will be logged out and asked to verify their email address on their next login. As a workaround, disable the patreon integration and log out all users with associated Patreon accounts.\n\n- CVE-2021-3632: A flaw was found in Keycloak. This vulnerability allows anyone to register a new security device or key when there is not a device already registered for any user by using the WebAuthn password-less login flow.\n\n- CVE-2022-46170: CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. When an application uses (1) multiple session cookies (e.g., one for user pages and one for admin pages) and (2) a session handler is set to `DatabaseHandler`, `MemcachedHandler`, or `RedisHandler`, then if an attacker gets one session cookie (e.g., one for user pages), they may be able to access pages that require another session cookie (e.g., for admin pages). This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.2.11 or later. As a workaround, use only one session cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-46316: A thread security vulnerability exists in the authentication process. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-30034: Flower, a web UI for the Celery Python RPC framework, all versions as of 05-02-2022 is vulnerable to an OAuth authentication bypass. An attacker could then access the Flower API to discover and invoke arbitrary Celery RPC calls or deny service by shutting down Celery task nodes.\n\n- CVE-2022-30124: An improper authentication vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat Mobile App <4.14.1.22788 that allowed an attacker with physical access to a mobile device to bypass local authentication (PIN code).\n\n- CVE-2021-43414: An issue was discovered in GNU Hurd before 0.9 20210404-9. The use of an authentication protocol in the proc server is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, which can be exploited for local privilege escalation to get full root access.\n\n- CVE-2022-21684: Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Versions prior to 2.7.13 in `stable`, 2.8.0.beta11 in `beta`, and 2.8.0.beta11 in `tests-passed` allow some users to log in to a community before they should be able to do so. A user invited via email to a forum with `must_approve_users` enabled is going to be automatically logged in, bypassing the check that does not allow unapproved users to sign in. They will be able to do everything an approved user can do. If they logout, they cannot log back in. This issue is patched in the `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11. One may disable invites as a workaround. Administrators can increase `min_trust_level_to_allow_invite` to reduce the attack surface to more trusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-2303: An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1. It may be possible for group members to bypass 2FA enforcement enabled at the group level by using Resource Owner Password Credentials grant to obtain an access token without using 2FA.\n\n- CVE-2022-34908: An issue was discovered in the A4N (Aremis 4 Nomad) application 1.5.0 for Android. It possesses an authentication mechanism; however, some features do not require any token or cookie in a request. Therefore, an attacker may send a simple HTTP request to the right endpoint, and obtain authorization to retrieve application data.\n\n- CVE-2022-36755: D-Link DIR845L A1 contains a authentication vulnerability via an AUTHORIZED_GROUP=1 value, as demonstrated by a request for getcfg.php.\n\n- CVE-2022-43400: A vulnerability has been identified in Siveillance Video Mobile Server V2022 R2 (All versions < V22.2a (80)). The mobile server component of affected applications improperly handles the log in for Active Directory accounts that are part of Administrators group. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to access the application without a valid account.\n\n- CVE-2022-48066: An issue in the component global.so of Totolink A830R V4.1.2cu.5182 allows attackers to bypass authentication via a crafted cookie.\n\n- CVE-2022-1053: Keylime does not enforce that the agent registrar data is the same when the tenant uses it for validation of the EK and identity quote and the verifier for validating the integrity quote. This allows an attacker to use one AK, EK pair from a real TPM to pass EK validation and give the verifier an AK of a software TPM. A successful attack breaks the entire chain of trust because a not validated AK is used by the verifier. This issue is worse if the validation happens first and then the agent gets added to the verifier because the timing is easier and the verifier does not validate the regcount entry being equal to 1,\n\n- CVE-2022-45124: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the User authentication functionality of WellinTech KingHistorian 35.01.00.05. A specially crafted network packet can lead to a disclosure of sensitive information.

The vulnerability is related to the injection of HTTP headers via a CORS ExposeHeader tag. The newline character in the ExposeHeader tag in the CORS configuration file generates a header injection in the response when the CORS request is made. In addition, the prior bug fix for CVE-2020-10753 did not account for the use of \\\\r as a header separator, thus a new flaw has been created.\n\n- CVE-2021-0553: In onBindViewHolder of AppSwitchPreference.java, there is a possible bypass of device admin setttings due to unclear UI. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with User execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-11Android ID: A-169936038\n\n- CVE-2021-0594: In onCreate of ConfirmConnectActivity, there is a possible remote bypass of user consent due to improper input validation.

Affected versions were found to be vulnerable to SMTP command injection. The impact varies based on which commands are supported by the backend SMTP server. However, the main risk here is that the attacker can then hijack an already-authenticated SMTP session and run arbitrary SMTP commands as the email user, such as sending emails to other users, changing the FROM user, and so on. As before, this depends on the configuration of the server itself, but newlines should be sanitized to mitigate such arbitrary SMTP command injection. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 22.2.8 , 23.0.5 or 24.0.1. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-31179: Shescape is a simple shell escape package for JavaScript. Versions prior to 1.5.8 were found to be subject to code injection on windows. This impacts users that use Shescape (any API function) to escape arguments for cmd.exe on Windows An attacker can omit all arguments following their input by including a line feed character (`'\\\\n'`) in the payload. This bug has been patched in [v1.5.8] which you can upgrade to now. No further changes are required. Alternatively, line feed characters (`'\\\\n'`) can be stripped out manually or the user input can be made the last argument (this only limits the impact).\n\n- CVE-2022-27924: Zimbra Collaboration (aka ZCS) 8.8.15 and 9.0 allows an unauthenticated attacker to inject arbitrary memcache commands into a targeted instance.

However, this would cause confusion with \"Cascading Style Sheets,\" so usage of this acronym has declined significantly.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\nExtended Details:\n\n\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-25926: Python Library Manager did not sufficiently neutralize a user-supplied search term, allowing reflected XSS.\n\n- CVE-2021-25963: Python-based e-commerce platform did not escape returned content on error pages, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.\n\n- CVE-2021-1879: Universal XSS in mobile operating system, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2020-3580: Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in firewall product leads to XSS (CWE-79), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2014-8958: Admin GUI allows XSS through cookie.\n\n- CVE-2017-9764: Web stats program allows XSS through crafted HTTP header.\n\n- CVE-2014-5198: Web log analysis product allows XSS through crafted HTTP Referer header.\n\n- CVE-2008-5080: Chain: protection mechanism failure allows XSS\n\n- CVE-2006-4308: Chain: incomplete denylist (CWE-184) only checks \"javascript:\" tag, allowing XSS (CWE-79) using other tags\n\n- CVE-2007-5727: Chain: incomplete denylist (CWE-184) only removes SCRIPT tags, enabling XSS (CWE-79)\n\n- CVE-2008-5770: Reflected XSS using the PATH_INFO in a URL\n\n- CVE-2008-4730: Reflected XSS not properly handled when generating an error message\n\n- CVE-2008-5734: Reflected XSS sent through email message.\n\n- CVE-2008-0971: Stored XSS in a security product.\n\n- CVE-2008-5249: Stored XSS using a wiki page.\n\n- CVE-2006-3568: Stored XSS in a guestbook application.\n\n- CVE-2006-3211: Stored XSS in a guestbook application using a javascript: URI in a bbcode img tag.\n\n- CVE-2006-3295: Chain: library file is not protected against a direct request (CWE-425), leading to reflected XSS (CWE-79).\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-7050: Codologic Codoforum through 4.8.4 allows a DOM-based XSS. While creating a new topic as a normal user, it is possible to add a poll that is automatically loaded in the DOM once the thread/topic is opened. Because session cookies lack the HttpOnly flag, it is possible to steal authentication cookies and take over accounts.\n\n- CVE-2020-7051: Codologic Codoforum through 4.8.4 allows stored XSS in the login area. This is relevant in conjunction with CVE-2020-5842 because session cookies lack the HttpOnly flag. The impact is account takeover.\n\n- CVE-2021-1543: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an attacker to do the following: Hijack a user session Execute arbitrary commands as a root user on the underlying operating system Conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack Conduct an HTML injection attack For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-21260: Online Invoicing System (OIS) is open source software which is a lean invoicing system for small businesses, consultants and freelancers created using AppGini. In OIS version 4.0 there is a stored XSS which can enables an attacker takeover of the admin account through a payload that extracts a csrf token and sends a request to change password. It has been found that Item description is reflected without sanitization in app/items_view.php which enables the malicious scenario.\n\n- CVE-2021-21283: Flarum is an open source discussion platform for websites. The \"Flarum Sticky\" extension versions 0.1.0-beta.14 and 0.1.0-beta.15 has a cross-site scripting vulnerability. A change in release beta 14 of the Sticky extension caused the plain text content of the first post of a pinned discussion to be injected as HTML on the discussion list. The issue was discovered following an internal audit. Any HTML would be injected through the m.trust() helper. This resulted in an HTML injection where <script> tags would not be executed. However it was possible to run javascript from other HTML attributes, enabling a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack to be performed. Since the exploit only happens with the first post of a pinned discussion, an attacker would need the ability to pin their own discussion, or be able to edit a discussion that was previously pinned. On forums where all pinned posts are authored by your staff, you can be relatively certain the vulnerability has not been exploited. Forums where some user-created discussions were pinned can look at the first post edit date to find whether the vulnerability might have been exploited. Because Flarum doesn't store the post content history, you cannot be certain if a malicious edit was reverted. The fix will be available in version v0.1.0-beta.16 with Flarum beta 16. The fix has already been back-ported to Flarum beta 15 as version v0.1.0-beta.15.1 of the Sticky extension. Forum administrators can disable the Sticky extension until they are able to apply the update. The vulnerability cannot be exploited while the extension is disabled.\n\n- CVE-2021-21332: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.27.0, the password reset endpoint served via Synapse was vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The impact depends on the configuration of the domain that Synapse is deployed on, but may allow access to cookies and other browser data, CSRF vulnerabilities, and access to other resources served on the same domain or parent domains. This is fixed in version 1.27.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-22223: Client-Side code injection through Feature Flag name in GitLab CE/EE starting with 11.9 allows a specially crafted feature flag name to PUT requests on behalf of other users via clicking on a link\n\n- CVE-2021-22722: A CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Stored Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could cause code injection when importing a CSV file or changing station parameters.\n\n- CVE-2021-22723: A CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-siteScripting) through Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in EVlink City (EVC1S22P4 / EVC1S7P4 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), EVlink Parking (EVW2 / EVF2 / EV.2 all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1), and EVlink Smart Wallbox (EVB1A all versions prior to R8 V3.4.0.1 ) that could allow an attacker to impersonate the user who manages the charging station or carry out actions on their behalf when crafted malicious parameters are submitted to the charging station web server.\n\n- CVE-2021-24301: The Hotjar Connecticator WordPress plugin through 1.1.1 is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the 'hotjar script' textarea. The request did include a CSRF nonce that was properly verified by the server and this vulnerability could only be exploited by administrator users.\n\n- CVE-2021-24891: The Elementor Website Builder WordPress plugin before 3.4.8 does not sanitise or escape user input appended to the DOM via a malicious hash, resulting in a DOM Cross-Site Scripting issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-25955: In \u201cDolibarr ERP CRM\u201d, WYSIWYG Editor module, v2.8.1 to v13.0.2 are affected by a stored XSS vulnerability that allows low privileged application users to store malicious scripts in the \u201cPrivate Note\u201d field at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint. These scripts are executed in a victim\u2019s browser when they open the page containing the vulnerable field. In the worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged administrator. The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account takeover of the admin and due to other vulnerability (Improper Access Control on Private notes) a low privileged user can update the private notes which could lead to privilege escalation.\n\n- CVE-2021-26929: An XSS issue was discovered in Horde Groupware Webmail Edition through 5.2.22 (where the Horde_Text_Filter library before 2.3.7 is used). The attacker can send a plain text e-mail message, with JavaScript encoded as a link or email that is mishandled by preProcess in Text2html.php, because bespoke use of \\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00 and \\\\x01\\\\x01\\\\x01 interferes with XSS defenses.\n\n- CVE-2021-29208: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29209: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29210: A remote dom xss, crlf injection vulnerability was discovered in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 4 (iLO 4); HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen9; HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) for HPE Gen10 Servers; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10; HPE SimpliVity 2600; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 G; HPE SimpliVity 325; HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 H version(s): Prior to version 2.78.\n\n- CVE-2021-29459: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. It is possible to persistently inject scripts in XWiki versions prior to 12.6.3 and 12.8. Unregistred users can fill simple text fields. Registered users can fill in their personal information and (if they have edit rights) fill the values of static lists using App Within Minutes. There is no easy workaround except upgrading XWiki. The vulnerability has been patched on XWiki 12.8 and 12.6.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32772: Poddycast is a podcast app made with Electron. Prior to version 0.8.1, an attacker can create a podcast or episode with malicious characters and execute commands on the client machine. The application does not clean the HTML characters of the podcast information obtained from the Feed, which allows the injection of HTML and JS code (cross-site scripting). Being an application made in electron, cross-site scripting can be scaled to remote code execution, making it possible to execute commands on the machine where the application is running. The vulnerability is patched in Poddycast version 0.8.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-34656: The 2Way VideoCalls and Random Chat - HTML5 Webcam Videochat WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the `vws_notice` function found in the ~/inc/requirements.php file which allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 5.2.7.\n\n- CVE-2021-34763: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an attacker to execute a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or an open redirect attack. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-34821: Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in AAT Novus Management System through 1.51.2. The WebUI has wrong HTTP 404 error handling implemented. A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to exploit the issue by sending malicious HTTP requests to non-existing URIs. The value of the URL path filename is copied into the HTML document as plain text tags.\n\n- CVE-2021-3529: A flaw was found in noobaa-core in versions before 5.7.0. This flaw results in the name of an arbitrarily URL being copied into an HTML document as plain text between tags, including potentially a payload script. The input was echoed unmodified in the application response, resulting in arbitrary JavaScript being injected into an application's response. The highest threat to the system is for confidentiality, availability, and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-39186: GlobalNewFiles is a MediaWiki extension maintained by Miraheze. Prior to commit number cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d, the username column of the GlobalNewFiles special page is vulnerable to a stored XSS. Commit number cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d contains a patch. As a workaround, one may disallow <,> (or other characters required to insert html/js) from being used in account names so an XSS is not possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-37541: In JetBrains Hub before 2021.1.13402, HTML injection in the password reset email was possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-34419: In the Zoom Client for Meetings for Ubuntu Linux before version 5.1.0, there is an HTML injection flaw when sending a remote control request to a user in the process of in-meeting screen sharing. This could allow meeting participants to be targeted for social engineering attacks.\n\n- CVE-2021-30057: A stored HTML injection vulnerability exists in Knowage Suite version 7.1. An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML in \"/restful-services/2.0/analyticalDrivers\" via the 'LABEL' and 'NAME' parameters.\n\n- CVE-2021-22232: HTML injection was possible via the full name field before versions 13.11.6, 13.12.6, and 14.0.2 in GitLab CE\n\n- CVE-2020-23050: TAO Open Source Assessment Platform v3.3.0 RC02 was discovered to contain a HTML injection vulnerability in the userFirstName parameter of the user account input field. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute phishing attacks, external redirects, and arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-39348: The LearnPress WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient escaping on the $custom_profile parameter found in the ~/inc/admin/views/backend-user-profile.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 4.1.3.1. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled. Please note that this is seperate from CVE-2021-24702.\n\n- CVE-2021-21333: Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.27.0, the notification emails sent for notifications for missed messages or for an expiring account are subject to HTML injection. In the case of the notification for missed messages, this could allow an attacker to insert forged content into the email. The account expiry feature is not enabled by default and the HTML injection is not controllable by an attacker. This is fixed in version 1.27.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-42663: An HTML injection vulnerability exists in Sourcecodester Online Event Booking and Reservation System in PHP/MySQL via the msg parameter to /event-management/index.php. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability in order to change the visibility of the website. Once the target user clicks on a given link he will display the content of the HTML code of the attacker's choice.\n\n- CVE-2021-41248: GraphiQL is the reference implementation of this monorepo, GraphQL IDE, an official project under the GraphQL Foundation. All versions of graphiql older than graphiql@1.4.7 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a vulnerable schema in graphiql. There are a number of ways that can occur. By default, the schema URL is not attacker-controllable in graphiql or in its suggested implementations or examples, leaving only very complex attack vectors. If a custom implementation of graphiql's fetcher allows the schema URL to be set dynamically, such as a URL query parameter like ?endpoint= in graphql-playground, or a database provided value, then this custom graphiql implementation is vulnerable to phishing attacks, and thus much more readily available, low or no privelege level xss attacks. The URLs could look like any generic looking graphql schema URL. It should be noted that desktop clients such as Altair, Insomnia, Postwoman, do not appear to be impacted by this. This vulnerability does not impact codemirror-graphql, monaco-graphql or other dependents, as it exists in onHasCompletion.ts in graphiql. It does impact all forks of graphiql, and every released version of graphiql.\n\n- CVE-2021-41249: GraphQL Playground is a GraphQL IDE for development of graphQL focused applications. All versions of graphql-playground-react older than graphql-playground-react@1.7.28 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a malicious schema in graphql-playground. There are several ways this can occur, including by specifying the URL to a malicious schema in the endpoint query parameter. If a user clicks on a link to a GraphQL Playground installation that specifies a malicious server, arbitrary JavaScript can run in the user's browser, which can be used to exfiltrate user credentials or other harmful goals. If you are using graphql-playground-react directly in your client app, upgrade to version 1.7.28 or later.\n\n- CVE-2021-41825: Verint Workforce Optimization (WFO) 15.2.5.1033 allows HTML injection via the /wfo/control/signin username parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-42564: An open redirect through HTML injection in confidential messages in Cryptshare before 5.1.0 allows remote attackers (with permission to provide confidential messages via Cryptshare) to redirect targeted victims to any URL via the '<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\"' substring in the editor parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-43683: pictshare v1.5 is affected by a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in api/info.php. The exit function will terminate the script and print the message which has $_REQUEST['hash'].\n\n- CVE-2021-31682: The login portal for the Automated Logic WebCTRL/WebCTRL OEM web application contains a vulnerability that allows for reflected XSS attacks due to the operatorlocale GET parameter not being sanitized. This issue impacts versions 6.5 and below.

Argo CD starting with 2.3.0 and prior to 2.3.6 and 2.4.5 is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript in the `/auth/callback` page in a victim's browser. This vulnerability only affects Argo CD instances which have single sign on (SSO) enabled. The exploit also assumes the attacker has 1) access to the API server's encryption key, 2) a method to add a cookie to the victim's browser, and 3) the ability to convince the victim to visit a malicious `/auth/callback` link. The vulnerability is classified as low severity because access to the API server's encryption key already grants a high level of access. Exploiting the XSS would allow the attacker to impersonate the victim, but would not grant any privileges which the attacker could not otherwise gain using the encryption key. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions 2.4.5 and 2.3.6. There is currently no known workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-3242: Code Injection in GitHub repository microweber/microweber prior to 1.3.2.\n\n- CVE-2022-32763: A cross-site scripting (xss) sanitization vulnerability bypass exists in the SanitizeHtml functionality of Lansweeper lansweeper 10.1.1.0.

An attacker can execute JavaScript code in the browser of the victim if a site is loaded. The victim's encrypted password can be stolen and most likely be decrypted.\n\n- CVE-2022-45004: Gophish through 0.12.1 was discovered to contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via a crafted landing page.\n\n- CVE-2022-45411: Cross-Site Tracing occurs when a server will echo a request back via the Trace method, allowing an XSS attack to access to authorization headers and cookies inaccessible to JavaScript (such as cookies protected by HTTPOnly). To mitigate this attack, browsers placed limits on <code>fetch()</code> and XMLHttpRequest; however some webservers have implemented non-standard headers such as <code>X-Http-Method-Override</code> that override the HTTP method, and made this attack possible again. Thunderbird has applied the same mitigations to the use of this and similar headers. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.\n\n- CVE-2022-39207: Onedev is an open source, self-hosted Git Server with CI/CD and Kanban. During CI/CD builds, it is possible to save build artifacts for later retrieval. They can be accessed through OneDev's web UI after the successful run of a build. These artifact files are served by the webserver in the same context as the UI without any further restrictions. This leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when a user creates a build artifact that contains HTML. When accessing the artifact, the content is rendered by the browser, including any JavaScript that it contains. Since all cookies (except for the rememberMe one) do not set the HttpOnly flag, an attacker could steal the session of a victim and use it to impersonate them. To exploit this issue, attackers need to be able to modify the content of artifacts, which usually means they need to be able to modify a project's build spec. The exploitation requires the victim to click on an attacker's link. It can be used to elevate privileges by targeting admins of a OneDev instance. In the worst case, this can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, because admins can create Server Shell Executors and use them to run any command on the server. This issue has been patched in version 7.3.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-3033: If a Thunderbird user replied to a crafted HTML email containing a <code>meta</code> tag, with the <code>meta</code> tag having the <code>http-equiv=\"refresh\"</code> attribute, and the content attribute specifying an URL, then Thunderbird started a network request to that URL, regardless of the configuration to block remote content. In combination with certain other HTML elements and attributes in the email, it was possible to execute JavaScript code included in the message in the context of the message compose document. The JavaScript code was able to perform actions including, but probably not limited to, read and modify the contents of the message compose document, including the quoted original message, which could potentially contain the decrypted plaintext of encrypted data in the crafted email. The contents could then be transmitted to the network, either to the URL specified in the META refresh tag, or to a different URL, as the JavaScript code could modify the URL specified in the document. This bug doesn't affect users who have changed the default Message Body display setting to 'simple html' or 'plain text'. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.2.1 and Thunderbird < 91.13.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-29444: Plugin Settings Change leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Cloudways Breeze plugin <= 2.0.2 on WordPress allows users with a subscriber or higher user role to execute any of the wp_ajax_* actions in the class Breeze_Configuration which includes the ability to change any of the plugin's settings including CDN setting which could be further used for XSS attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-36176: Multiple uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerabilities in the web interface of FortiPortal before 6.0.6 may allow a single low-privileged user to induce a denial of service via multiple HTTP requests.\n\n- CVE-2021-43929: Improper neutralization of special elements in output used by a downstream component ('Injection') vulnerability in work flow management in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 7.0.1-42218-2 allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2022-2178: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Saysis Computer Starcities allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).This issue affects Starcities: before 1.1. \n\n- CVE-2022-38628: Nortek Linear eMerge E3-Series 0.32-08f, 0.32-07p, 0.32-07e, 0.32-09c, 0.32-09b, 0.32-09a, and 0.32-08e were discovered to contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability which is chained with a local session fixation.

An attacker is able to inject arbitrary `CSS` into the generated graph allowing them to change the styling of elements outside of the generated graph, and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information by using specially crafted `CSS` selectors. The following example shows how an attacker can exfiltrate the contents of an input field by bruteforcing the `value` attribute one character at a time. Whenever there is an actual match, an `http` request will be made by the browser in order to \"load\" a background image that will let an attacker know what's the value of the character. This issue may lead to `Information Disclosure` via CSS selectors and functions able to generate HTTP requests. This also allows an attacker to change the document in ways which may lead a user to perform unintended actions, such as clicking on a link, etc. This issue has been resolved in version 9.1.3.

However, including unexpected data in an HTTP header allows an attacker to specify the entirety of the HTTP message that is rendered by the client HTTP agent (e.g., web browser) or back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web server), whether the message is part of a request or a response. \n\n\nWhen an HTTP request contains unexpected CR and LF characters, the server may respond with an output stream that is interpreted as \"splitting\" the stream into two different HTTP messages instead of one. CR is carriage return, also given by %0d or \\r, and LF is line feed, also given by %0a or \\n.\n\n\nIn addition to CR and LF characters, other valid/RFC compliant special characters and unique character encodings can be utilized, such as HT (horizontal tab, also given by %09 or \\t) and SP (space, also given as + sign or %20).\n\n\nThese types of unvalidated and unexpected data in HTTP message headers allow an attacker to control the second \"split\" message to mount attacks such as server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and cache poisoning attacks.\n\n\nHTTP response splitting weaknesses may be present when:\n\n\n  1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request.\n\n  1. The data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without neutralizing malicious characters that can be interpreted as separator characters for headers.\n\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-15811: Chain: Proxy uses a substring search instead of parsing the Transfer-Encoding header (CWE-697), allowing request splitting (CWE-113) and cache poisoning\n\n- CVE-2021-41084: Scala-based HTTP interface allows request splitting and response splitting through header names, header values, status reasons, and URIs\n\n- CVE-2018-12116: Javascript-based framework allows request splitting through a path option of an HTTP request\n\n- CVE-2004-2146: Application accepts CRLF in an object ID, allowing HTTP response splitting.\n\n- CVE-2004-1656: Shopping cart allows HTTP response splitting to perform HTML injection via CRLF in a parameter for a url\n\n- CVE-2005-2060: Bulletin board allows response splitting via CRLF in parameter.\n\n- CVE-2004-2512: Response splitting via CRLF in PHPSESSID.\n\n- CVE-2005-1951: e-commerce app allows HTTP response splitting using CRLF in object id parameters\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0268: An Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting') weakness in J-web of Juniper Networks Junos OS leads to buffer overflows, segment faults, or other impacts, which allows an attacker to modify the integrity of the device and exfiltration information from the device without authentication. The weakness can be exploited to facilitate cross-site scripting (XSS), cookie manipulation (modifying session cookies, stealing cookies) and more. This weakness can also be exploited by directing a user to a seemingly legitimate link from the affected site. The attacker requires no special access or permissions to the device to carry out such attacks. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS: 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S11; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S5; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S3; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S5, 18.4R3-S3; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S2, 19.1R3-S2; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S5, 19.2R2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S3, 19.4R2, 19.4R3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S2, 20.1R2.

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using specially-crafted URL to cause the server to return a split response, once the URL is clicked.\n\n- CVE-2021-41084: http4s is an open source scala interface for HTTP. In affected versions http4s is vulnerable to response-splitting or request-splitting attacks when untrusted user input is used to create any of the following fields: Header names (`Header.name`\u00e5), Header values (`Header.value`), Status reason phrases (`Status.reason`), URI paths (`Uri.Path`), URI authority registered names (`URI.RegName`) (through 0.21). This issue has been resolved in versions 0.21.30, 0.22.5, 0.23.4, and 1.0.0-M27 perform the following. As a matter of practice http4s services and client applications should sanitize any user input in the aforementioned fields before returning a request or response to the backend. The carriage return, newline, and null characters are the most threatening.\n\n- CVE-2021-45818: SAFARI Montage 8.7.32 is affected by a CRLF injection vulnerability which can lead to HTTP response splitting.\n\n- CVE-2021-33621: The cgi gem before 0.1.0.2, 0.2.x before 0.2.2, and 0.3.x before 0.3.5 for Ruby allows HTTP response splitting. This is relevant to applications that use untrusted user input either to generate an HTTP response or to create a CGI::Cookie object.\n\n- CVE-2021-40336: A vulnerability exists in the http web interface where the web interface does not validate data in an HTTP header. This causes a possible HTTP response splitting, which if exploited could lead an attacker to channel down harmful code into the user\u2019s web browser, such as to steal the session cookies. Thus, an attacker who successfully makes an MSM user who has already established a session to MSM web interface clicks a forged link to the MSM web interface, e.g., the link is sent per E-Mail, could trick the user into downloading malicious software onto his computer. This issue affects: Hitachi Energy MSM V2.2 and prior versions.\n\n- CVE-2021-41437: An HTTP response splitting attack in web application in ASUS RT-AX88U before v3.0.0.4.388.20558 allows an attacker to craft a specific URL that if an authenticated victim visits it, the URL will give access to the cloud storage of the attacker.\n\n- CVE-2022-20772: A vulnerability in Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an HTTP response splitting attack.

WorkstationST v07.09.15 can be found in ControlST v07.09.07 SP8 and greater.\n\n- CVE-2022-42471: An improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers ('HTTP Response Splitting') vulnerability [CWE-113] In FortiWeb version 7.0.0 through 7.0.2, FortiWeb version 6.4.0 through 6.4.2, FortiWeb version 6.3.6 through 6.3.20 may allow an authenticated and remote attacker to inject arbitrary headers.\n\n- CVE-2022-42472: A improper neutralization of crlf sequences in http headers ('http response splitting') in Fortinet FortiOS versions 7.2.0 through 7.2.2, 7.0.0 through 7.0.8, 6.4.0 through 6.4.11, 6.2.0 through 6.2.12, 6.0.0 through 6.0.16, FortiProxy 7.2.0 through 7.2.1, 7.0.0 through 7.0.7, 2.0.0 through 2.0.10, 1.2.0 through 1.2.13, 1.1.0 through 1.1.6 may allow an authenticated and remote attacker to perform an HTTP request splitting attack which gives attackers control of the remaining headers and body of the response.\n\n- CVE-2022-47052: The web interface of the 'Nighthawk R6220 AC1200 Smart Wi-Fi Router' is vulnerable to a CRLF Injection attack that can be leveraged to perform Reflected XSS and HTML Injection. A malicious unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted URL. This affects firmware versions: V1.1.0.112_1.0.1, V1.1.0.114_1.0.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-37499: CRLF vulnerability in Reprise License Manager (RLM) web interface through 14.2BL4 in the password parameter in View License Result function, that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers.\n\n- CVE-2022-32453: HTTP header injection vulnerability in Cybozu Office 10.0.0 to 10.8.5 may allow a remote attacker to obtain and/or alter the data of the product via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2022-3918: A program using FoundationNetworking in swift-corelibs-foundation is potentially vulnerable to CRLF ( ) injection in URLRequest headers. In this vulnerability, a client can insert one or several CRLF sequences into a URLRequest header value. When that request is sent via URLSession to an HTTP server, the server may interpret the content after the CRLF as extra headers, or even a second request. For example, consider a URLRequest to http://example.com/ with the GET method. Suppose we set the URLRequest header \"Foo\" to the value \"Bar Extra-Header: Added GET /other HTTP/1.1\". When this request is sent, it will appear to the server as two requests: GET / HTTP/1.1 Foo: Bar Extra-Header: Added GET /other HTTP/1.1 In this manner, the client is able to inject extra headers and craft an entirely new request to a separate path, despite only making one API call in URLSession. If a developer has total control over the request and its headers, this vulnerability may not pose a threat. However, this vulnerability escalates if un-sanitized user input is placed in header values. If so, a malicious user could inject new headers or requests to an intermediary or backend server. Developers should be especially careful to sanitize user input in this case, or upgrade their version of swift-corelibs-foundation to include the patch below.\n\n- CVE-2022-4188: Insufficient validation of untrusted input in CORS in Google Chrome on Android prior to 108.0.5359.71 allowed a remote attacker to bypass same origin policy via a crafted HTML page.

Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-34359: Chain: Python bindings for LLM library do not use a sandboxed environment when parsing a template and constructing a prompt, allowing jinja2 Server Side Template Injection and code execution - one variant of a \"prompt injection\" attack.\n\n- CVE-2017-16783: server-side template injection in content management server\n\n- CVE-2020-9437: authentication / identity management product has client-side template injection\n\n- CVE-2020-12790: Server-Side Template Injection using a Twig template\n\n- CVE-2021-21244: devops platform allows SSTI\n\n- CVE-2020-4027: bypass of Server-Side Template Injection protection mechanism with macros in Velocity templates\n\n- CVE-2020-26282: web browser proxy server allows Java EL expressions from Server-Side Template Injection\n\n- CVE-2020-1961: SSTI involving mail templates and JEXL expressions\n\n- CVE-2019-19999: product does not use a \"safe\" setting for a FreeMarker configuration, allowing SSTI\n\n- CVE-2018-20465: product allows read of sensitive database username/password variables using server-side template injection\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-25283: An issue was discovered in through SaltStack Salt before 3002.5.

In versions before 3.0.0 vault-cli features the ability for rendering templated values. When a secret starts with the prefix `!template!`, vault-cli interprets the rest of the contents of the secret as a Jinja2 template. Jinja2 is a powerful templating engine and is not designed to safely render arbitrary templates. An attacker controlling a jinja2 template rendered on a machine can trigger arbitrary code, making this a Remote Code Execution (RCE) risk. If the content of the vault can be completely trusted, then this is not a problem. Otherwise, if your threat model includes cases where an attacker can manipulate a secret value read from the vault using vault-cli, then this vulnerability may impact you. In 3.0.0, the code related to interpreting vault templated secrets has been removed entirely. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. For users unable to upgrade a workaround does exist. Using the environment variable `VAULT_CLI_RENDER=false` or the flag `--no-render` (placed between `vault-cli` and the subcommand, e.g. `vault-cli --no-render get-all`) or adding `render: false` to the vault-cli configuration yaml file disables rendering and removes the vulnerability. Using the python library, you can use: `vault_cli.get_client(render=False)` when creating your client to get a client that will not render templated secrets and thus operates securely.\n\n- CVE-2021-46063: MCMS v5.2.5 was discovered to contain a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability via the Template Management module.\n\n- CVE-2021-40219: Bolt CMS <= 4.2 is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.

A malicious user can modify the contents of a `confirmation_token` input during the two-factor authentication process to reference a cache value not associated with the login attempt. In rare cases this can allow a malicious actor to authenticate as a random user in the Panel. The malicious user must target an account with two-factor authentication enabled, and then must provide a correct two-factor authentication token before being authenticated as that user. Due to a validation flaw in the logic handling user authentication during the two-factor authentication process a malicious user can trick the system into loading credentials for an arbitrary user by modifying the token sent to the server. This authentication flaw is present in the `LoginCheckpointController@__invoke` method which handles two-factor authentication for a user. This controller looks for a request input parameter called `confirmation_token` which is expected to be a 64 character random alpha-numeric string that references a value within the Panel's cache containing a `user_id` value. This value is then used to fetch the user that attempted to login, and lookup their two-factor authentication token. Due to the design of this system, any element in the cache that contains only digits could be referenced by a malicious user, and whatever value is stored at that position would be used as the `user_id`. There are a few different areas of the Panel that store values into the cache that are integers, and a user who determines what those cache keys are could pass one of those keys which would cause this code pathway to reference an arbitrary user. At its heart this is a high-risk login bypass vulnerability. However, there are a few additional conditions that must be met in order for this to be successfully executed, notably: 1.) The account referenced by the malicious cache key must have two-factor authentication enabled. An account without two-factor authentication would cause an exception to be triggered by the authentication logic, thusly exiting this authentication flow. 2.) Even if the malicious user is able to reference a valid cache key that references a valid user account with two-factor authentication, they must provide a valid two-factor authentication token. However, due to the design of this endpoint once a valid user account is found with two-factor authentication enabled there is no rate-limiting present, thusly allowing an attacker to brute force combinations until successful. This leads to a third condition that must be met: 3.) For the duration of this attack sequence the cache key being referenced must continue to exist with a valid `user_id` value. Depending on the specific key being used for this attack, this value may disappear quickly, or be changed by other random user interactions on the Panel, outside the control of the attacker. In order to mitigate this vulnerability the underlying authentication logic was changed to use an encrypted session store that the user is therefore unable to control the value of. This completely removed the use of a user-controlled value being used. In addition, the code was audited to ensure this type of vulnerability is not present elsewhere.\n\n- CVE-2021-42338: 4MOSAn GCB Doctor\u2019s login page has improper validation of Cookie, which allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass authentication by code injection in cookie, and arbitrarily manipulate the system or interrupt services by upload and execution of arbitrary files.\n\n- CVE-2021-1541: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an attacker to do the following: Hijack a user session Execute arbitrary commands as a root user on the underlying operating system Conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack Conduct an HTML injection attack For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-41317: XSS Hunter Express before 2021-09-17 does not properly enforce authentication requirements for paths.\n\n- CVE-2021-29012: DMA Softlab Radius Manager 4.4.0 assigns the same session cookie to every admin session.

As a workaround, one may disable basic authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-21378: Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In Envoy version 1.17.0 an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list when Envoy's JWT Authentication filter is configured with the `allow_missing` requirement under `requires_any` due to a mistake in implementation. Envoy's JWT Authentication filter can be configured with the `allow_missing` requirement that will be satisfied if JWT is missing (JwtMissed error) and fail if JWT is presented or invalid. Due to a mistake in implementation, a JwtUnknownIssuer error was mistakenly converted to JwtMissed when `requires_any` was configured. So if `allow_missing` was configured under `requires_any`, an attacker can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list. Integrity may be impacted depending on configuration if the JWT token is used to protect against writes or modifications. This regression was introduced on 2020/11/12 in PR 13839 which fixed handling `allow_missing` under RequiresAny in a JwtRequirement (see issue 13458). The AnyVerifier aggregates the children verifiers' results into a final status where JwtMissing is the default error. However, a JwtUnknownIssuer was mistakenly treated the same as a JwtMissing error and the resulting final aggregation was the default JwtMissing. As a result, `allow_missing` would allow a JWT token with an unknown issuer status. This is fixed in version 1.17.1 by PR 15194. The fix works by preferring JwtUnknownIssuer over a JwtMissing error, fixing the accidental conversion and bypass with `allow_missing`. A user could detect whether a bypass occurred if they have Envoy logs enabled with debug verbosity. Users can enable component level debug logs for JWT. The JWT filter logs will indicate that there is a request with a JWT token and a failure that the JWT token is missing.\n\n- CVE-2021-21513: Dell EMC OpenManage Server Administrator (OMSA) version 9.5 Microsoft Windows installations with Distributed Web Server (DWS) enabled configuration contains an authentication bypass vulnerability.

Due to a bug in ASF code `POST /Api/ASF` ASF API endpoint responsible for updating global ASF config incorrectly removed `IPCPassword` from the resulting config when the caller did not specify it explicitly. Due to the above, it was possible for the user to accidentally remove `IPCPassword` security measure from his IPC interface when updating global ASF config, which exists as part of global config update functionality in ASF-ui. Removal of `IPCPassword` possesses a security risk, as unauthorized users may in result access the IPC interface after such modification. The issue is patched in ASF V5.1.2.4 and future versions. We recommend to manually verify that `IPCPassword` is specified after update, and if not, set it accordingly. In default settings, ASF is configured to allow IPC access from `localhost` only and should not affect majority of users.\n\n- CVE-2021-3282: HashiCorp Vault Enterprise 1.6.0 & 1.6.1 allowed the `remove-peer` raft operator command to be executed against DR secondaries without authentication.

Prior to version 1.10.7, FreeSWITCH does not authenticate SIP MESSAGE requests, leading to spam and message spoofing. By default, SIP requests of the type MESSAGE (RFC 3428) are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. MESSAGE requests are relayed to SIP user agents registered with the FreeSWITCH server without requiring any authentication. Although this behaviour can be changed by setting the `auth-messages` parameter to `true`, it is not the default setting. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to send SIP MESSAGE messages to any SIP user agent that is registered with the server without requiring authentication. Additionally, since no authentication is required, chat messages can be spoofed to appear to come from trusted entities. Therefore, abuse can lead to spam and enable social engineering, phishing and similar attacks. This issue is patched in version 1.10.7. Maintainers recommend that this SIP message type is authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to be explicitly set the `auth-messages` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-38412: Properly formatted POST requests to multiple resources on the HTTP and HTTPS web servers of the Digi PortServer TS 16 Rack device do not require authentication or authentication tokens.

By default, SIP requests of the type SUBSCRIBE are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to subscribe to user agent event notifications without the need to authenticate. This abuse poses privacy concerns and might lead to social engineering or similar attacks. For example, attackers may be able to monitor the status of target SIP extensions. Although this issue was fixed in version v1.10.6, installations upgraded to the fixed version of FreeSWITCH from an older version, may still be vulnerable if the configuration is not updated accordingly. Software upgrades do not update the configuration by default. SIP SUBSCRIBE messages should be authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to explicitly set the `auth-subscriptions` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2020-25566: In SapphireIMS 5.0, it is possible to take over an account by sending a request to the Save_Password form as shown in POC.

These special elements can carry control implications. If product does not prevent external control or influence over the inclusion of such special elements, the control flow of the program may be altered from what was intended. For example, both Unix and Windows interpret the symbol < (\"less than\") as meaning \"read input from a file\".\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2001-0677: Read arbitrary files from mail client by providing a special MIME header that is internally used to store pathnames for attachments.\n\n- CVE-2000-0703: Setuid program does not cleanse special escape sequence before sending data to a mail program, causing the mail program to process those sequences.\n\n- CVE-2003-0020: Multi-channel issue.

It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-5184: API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n\n- CVE-1999-0067: Canonical example of OS command injection.

If the token cannot match, the engine \"backtracks\" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.\n Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:\n\n\n  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.\n\n  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.\n\n  - The input can be long enough.\n\n Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. \n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-5243: server allows ReDOS with crafted User-Agent strings, due to overlapping capture groups that cause excessive backtracking.\n\n- CVE-2021-21317: npm package for user-agent parser prone to ReDoS due to overlapping capture groups\n\n- CVE-2019-16215: Markdown parser uses inefficient regex when processing a message, allowing users to cause CPU consumption and delay preventing processing of other messages.\n\n- CVE-2019-6785: Long string in a version control product allows DoS due to an inefficient regex.\n\n- CVE-2019-12041: Javascript code allows ReDoS via a long string due to excessive backtracking.\n\n- CVE-2015-8315: ReDoS when parsing time.\n\n- CVE-2015-8854: ReDoS when parsing documents.\n\n- CVE-2017-16021: ReDoS when validating URL.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-32740: Addressable is an alternative implementation to the URI implementation that is part of Ruby's standard library. An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability exists after version 2.3.0 through version 2.7.0. Within the URI template implementation in Addressable, a maliciously crafted template may result in uncontrolled resource consumption, leading to denial of service when matched against a URI. In typical usage, templates would not normally be read from untrusted user input, but nonetheless, no previous security advisory for Addressable has cautioned against doing this. Users of the parsing capabilities in Addressable but not the URI template capabilities are unaffected. The vulnerability is patched in version 2.8.0. As a workaround, only create Template objects from trusted sources that have been validated not to produce catastrophic backtracking.\n\n- CVE-2021-32763: OpenProject is open-source, web-based project management software. In versions prior to 11.3.3, the `MessagesController` class of OpenProject has a `quote` method that implements the logic behind the Quote button in the discussion forums, and it uses a regex to strip `<pre>` tags from the message being quoted. The `(.|\\\\s)` part can match a space character in two ways, so an unterminated `<pre>` tag containing `n` spaces causes Ruby's regex engine to backtrack to try 2<sup>n</sup> states in the NFA. This will result in a Regular Expression Denial of Service. The issue is fixed in OpenProject 11.3.3. As a workaround, one may install the patch manually.\n\n- CVE-2021-32838: Flask-RESTX (pypi package flask-restx) is a community driven fork of Flask-RESTPlus.

If you are unable to update you may also set `$wgDplSettings['functionalRichness'] = 0;` or disable DynamicPageList3 to mitigate.\n\n- CVE-2021-41186: Fluentd collects events from various data sources and writes them to files to help unify logging infrastructure. The parser_apache2 plugin in Fluentd v0.14.14 to v1.14.1 suffers from a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability. A broken apache log with a certain pattern of string can spend too much time in a regular expression, resulting in the potential for a DoS attack. This issue is patched in version 1.14.2 There are two workarounds available. Either don't use parser_apache2 for parsing logs (which cannot guarantee generated by Apache), or put patched version of parser_apache2.rb into /etc/fluent/plugin directory (or any other directories specified by the environment variable `FLUENT_PLUGIN` or `--plugin` option of fluentd).\n\n- CVE-2021-42836: GJSON before 1.9.3 allows a ReDoS (regular expression denial of service) attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-44686: calibre before 5.32.0 contains a regular expression that is vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) in html_preprocess_rules in ebooks/conversion/preprocess.py.\n\n- CVE-2020-1920: A regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the validateBaseUrl function can cause the application to use excessive resources, become unresponsive, or crash.

The fix will be available in version 25.0.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21267: Schema-Inspector is an open-source tool to sanitize and validate JS objects (npm package schema-inspector). In before version 2.0.0, email address validation is vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack where some input (for example `a@0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.`) will freeze the program or web browser page executing the code. This affects any current schema-inspector users using any version to validate email addresses. Users who do not do email validation, and instead do other types of validation (like string min or max length, etc), are not affected. Users should upgrade to version 2.0.0, which uses a regex expression that isn't vulnerable to ReDoS.\n\n- CVE-2021-21306: Marked is an open-source markdown parser and compiler (npm package \"marked\").

Versions prior to 3.6.5 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. The vulnerability is present in PunktSentenceTokenizer, sent_tokenize and word_tokenize. Any users of this class, or these two functions, are vulnerable to the ReDoS attack. In short, a specifically crafted long input to any of these vulnerable functions will cause them to take a significant amount of execution time. If your program relies on any of the vulnerable functions for tokenizing unpredictable user input, then we would strongly recommend upgrading to a version of NLTK without the vulnerability. For users unable to upgrade the execution time can be bounded by limiting the maximum length of an input to any of the vulnerable functions. Our recommendation is to implement such a limit.\n\n- CVE-2021-23354: The package printf before 0.6.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the regex string /\\\\%(?:\\\\(([\\\\w_.]+)\\\\)|([1-9]\\\\d*)\\\\$)?([0 +\\\\-\\\\]*)(\\\\*|\\\\d+)?(\\\\.)?(\\\\*|\\\\d+)?[hlL]?([\\\\%bscdeEfFgGioOuxX])/g in lib/printf.js.

In affected versions Zulip allows organization administrators on a server to configure \"linkifiers\" that automatically create links from messages that users send, detected via arbitrary regular expressions. Malicious organization administrators could subject the server to a denial-of-service via regular expression complexity attacks; most simply, by configuring a quadratic-time regular expression in a linkifier, and sending messages that exploited it. A regular expression attempted to parse the user-provided regexes to verify that they were safe from ReDoS -- this was both insufficient, as well as _itself_ subject to ReDoS if the organization administrator entered a sufficiently complex invalid regex. Affected users should [upgrade to the just-released Zulip 4.7](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release), or [`main`](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-from-a-git-repository).\n\n- CVE-2021-41817: Date.parse in the date gem through 3.2.0 for Ruby allows ReDoS (regular expression Denial of Service) via a long string.

The exploitation of this vulnerability could be triggered via the parse function.\n\n- CVE-2022-21681: Marked is a markdown parser and compiler. Prior to version 4.0.10, the regular expression `inline.reflinkSearch` may cause catastrophic backtracking against some strings and lead to a denial of service (DoS). Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version of marked and does not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is patched in version 4.0.10. As a workaround, avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run marked on a worker thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources.\n\n- CVE-2022-24373: The package react-native-reanimated before 3.0.0-rc.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to improper usage of regular expression in the parser of Colors.js.\n\n- CVE-2022-24713: regex is an implementation of regular expressions for the Rust language. The regex crate features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service attacks caused by untrusted regexes, or untrusted input matched by trusted regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered part of the crate's API. Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing, and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to services accepting user-controlled, untrusted regexes. All versions of the regex crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this issue. The fix is include starting from regex 1.5.5. All users accepting user-controlled regexes are recommended to upgrade immediately to the latest version of the regex crate. Unfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are practically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability. Because of this, it us not recommend to deny known problematic regexes.\n\n- CVE-2022-25598: Apache DolphinScheduler user registration is vulnerable to Regular express Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks, Apache DolphinScheduler users should upgrade to version 2.0.5 or higher.\n\n- CVE-2022-25758: All versions of package scss-tokenizer are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the loadAnnotation() function, due to the usage of insecure regex.\n\n- CVE-2022-25844: The package angular after 1.7.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) by providing a custom locale rule that makes it possible to assign the parameter in posPre: ' '.repeat() of NUMBER_FORMATS.PATTERNS[1].posPre with a very high value. **Note:** 1) This package has been deprecated and is no longer maintained. 2) The vulnerable versions are 1.7.0 and higher.\n\n- CVE-2022-25858: The package terser before 4.8.1, from 5.0.0 and before 5.14.2 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to insecure usage of regular expressions.\n\n- CVE-2022-25887: The package sanitize-html before 2.7.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to insecure global regular expression replacement logic of HTML comment removal.\n\n- CVE-2022-25918: The package shescape from 1.5.10 and before 1.6.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the escape function in index.js, due to the usage of insecure regex in the escapeArgBash function.\n\n- CVE-2022-29158: Apache OFBiz up to version 18.12.05 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the way it handles URLs provided by external, unauthenticated users.

Hawk used a regular expression to parse `Host` HTTP header (`Hawk.utils.parseHost()`), which was subject to regular expression DoS attack - meaning each added character in the attacker's input increases the computation time exponentially. `parseHost()` was patched in `9.0.1` to use built-in `URL` class to parse hostname instead. `Hawk.authenticate()` accepts `options` argument. If that contains `host` and `port`, those would be used instead of a call to `utils.parseHost()`.\n\n- CVE-2022-29169: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions starting with 2.2 and prior to 2.3.19, 2.4.7, and 2.5.0-beta.2 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. By using specific a RegularExpression, an attacker can cause denial of service for the bbb-html5 service. The useragent library performs checking of device by parsing the input of User-Agent header and lets it go through lookupUserAgent() (alias of useragent.lookup() ). This function handles input by regexing and attackers can abuse that by providing some ReDos payload using `SmartWatch`. The maintainers removed `htmlclient/useragent` from versions 2.3.19, 2.4.7, and 2.5.0-beta.2. As a workaround, disable NginX forwarding the requests to the handler according to the directions in the GitHub Security Advisory.\n\n- CVE-2022-31129: moment is a JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates.

The severity of the error can range widely, depending on the context in which the product operates, the type of sensitive information that is revealed, and the benefits it may provide to an attacker. Some kinds of sensitive information include:\n\n\n  - private, personal information, such as personal messages, financial data, health records, geographic location, or contact details\n\n  - system status and environment, such as the operating system and installed packages\n\n  - business secrets and intellectual property\n\n  - network status and configuration\n\n  - the product's own code or internal state\n\n  - metadata, e.g. logging of connections or message headers\n\n  - indirect information, such as a discrepancy between two internal operations that can be observed by an outsider\n\nInformation might be sensitive to different parties, each of which may have their own expectations for whether the information should be protected. These parties include:\n\n  - the product's own users\n\n  - people or organizations whose information is created or used by the product, even if they are not direct product users\n\n  - the product's administrators, including the admins of the system(s) and/or networks on which the product operates\n\n  - the developer\n\nInformation exposures can occur in different ways:\n\n  - the code  **explicitly inserts**  sensitive information into resources or messages that are intentionally made accessible to unauthorized actors, but should not contain the information - i.e., the information should have been \"scrubbed\" or \"sanitized\"\n\n  - a different weakness or mistake  **indirectly inserts**  the sensitive information into resources, such as a web script error revealing the full system path of the program.\n\n  - the code manages resources that intentionally contain sensitive information, but the resources are  **unintentionally made accessible**  to unauthorized actors. In this case, the information exposure is resultant - i.e., a different weakness enabled the access to the information in the first place.\n\nIt is common practice to describe any loss of confidentiality as an \"information exposure,\" but this can lead to overuse of CWE-200 in CWE mapping. From the CWE perspective, loss of confidentiality is a technical impact that can arise from dozens of different weaknesses, such as insecure file permissions or out-of-bounds read. CWE-200 and its lower-level descendants are intended to cover the mistakes that occur in behaviors that explicitly manage, store, transfer, or cleanse sensitive information.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-31162: Rust library leaks Oauth client details in application debug logs\n\n- CVE-2021-25476: Digital Rights Management (DRM) capability for mobile platform leaks pointer information, simplifying ASLR bypass\n\n- CVE-2001-1483: Enumeration of valid usernames based on inconsistent responses\n\n- CVE-2001-1528: Account number enumeration via inconsistent responses.\n\n- CVE-2004-2150: User enumeration via discrepancies in error messages.\n\n- CVE-2005-1205: Telnet protocol allows servers to obtain sensitive environment information from clients.\n\n- CVE-2002-1725: Script calls phpinfo(), revealing system configuration to web user\n\n- CVE-2002-0515: Product sets a different TTL when a port is being filtered than when it is not being filtered, which allows remote attackers to identify filtered ports by comparing TTLs.\n\n- CVE-2004-0778: Version control system allows remote attackers to determine the existence of arbitrary files and directories via the -X command for an alternate history file, which causes different error messages to be returned.\n\n- CVE-2000-1117: Virtual machine allows malicious web site operators to determine the existence of files on the client by measuring delays in the execution of the getSystemResource method.\n\n- CVE-2003-0190: Product immediately sends an error message when a user does not exist, which allows remote attackers to determine valid usernames via a timing attack.\n\n- CVE-2008-2049: POP3 server reveals a password in an error message after multiple APOP commands are sent.

In affected versions users who use [`HttpAuthMiddleware`](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth) (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for Splash authentication will have any non-Splash request expose your credentials to the request target. This includes `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`. Upgrade to scrapy-splash 0.8.0 and use the new `SPLASH_USER` and `SPLASH_PASS` settings instead to set your Splash authentication credentials safely. If you cannot upgrade, set your Splash request credentials on a per-request basis, [using the `splash_headers` request parameter](https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash/tree/0.8.x#http-basic-auth), instead of defining them globally using the [`HttpAuthMiddleware`](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth). Alternatively, make sure all your requests go through Splash. That includes disabling the [robots.txt middleware](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#topics-dlmw-robots).\n\n- CVE-2021-32720: Sylius is an Open Source eCommerce platform on top of Symfony. In versions of Sylius prior to 1.9.5 and 1.10.0-RC.1, part of the details (order ID, order number, items total, and token value) of all placed orders were exposed to unauthorized users. If exploited properly, a few additional information like the number of items in the cart and the date of the shipping may be fetched as well. This data seems to not be crucial nor is personal data, however, could be used for sociotechnical attacks or may expose a few details about shop condition to the third parties. The data possible to aggregate are the number of processed orders or their value in the moment of time. The problem has been patched at Sylius 1.9.5 and 1.10.0-RC.1. There are a few workarounds for the vulnerability. The first possible solution is to hide the problematic endpoints behind the firewall from not logged in users. This would put only the order list under the firewall and allow only authorized users to access it. Once a user is authorized, it will have access to theirs orders only. The second possible solution is to decorate the `\\\\Sylius\\\\Bundle\\\\ApiBundle\\\\Doctrine\\\\QueryCollectionExtension\\\\OrdersByLoggedInUserExtension` and throw `Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Security\\\\Core\\\\Exception\\\\AccessDeniedException` if the class is executed for unauthorized user.\n\n- CVE-2021-39192: Ghost is a Node.js content management system.

          "type": "Base",
          "extended_description": "\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n",

However, including unexpected data in an HTTP header allows an attacker to specify the entirety of the HTTP message that is rendered by the client HTTP agent (e.g., web browser) or back-end HTTP agent (e.g., web server), whether the message is part of a request or a response. \n\n\nWhen an HTTP request contains unexpected CR and LF characters, the server may respond with an output stream that is interpreted as \"splitting\" the stream into two different HTTP messages instead of one. CR is carriage return, also given by %0d or \\r, and LF is line feed, also given by %0a or \\n.\n\n\nIn addition to CR and LF characters, other valid/RFC compliant special characters and unique character encodings can be utilized, such as HT (horizontal tab, also given by %09 or \\t) and SP (space, also given as + sign or %20).\n\n\nThese types of unvalidated and unexpected data in HTTP message headers allow an attacker to control the second \"split\" message to mount attacks such as server-side request forgery, cross-site scripting, and cache poisoning attacks.\n\n\nHTTP response splitting weaknesses may be present when:\n\n\n  1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source, most frequently an HTTP request.\n\n  1. The data is included in an HTTP response header sent to a web user without neutralizing malicious characters that can be interpreted as separator characters for headers.\n\n",

Some CMS (Content Management Systems) also use templates.\n\n\nTemplate engines often have their own custom command or expression language. If an attacker can influence input into a template before it is processed, then the attacker can invoke arbitrary expressions, i.e. perform injection attacks. For example, in some template languages, an attacker could inject the expression \"{{7*7}}\" and determine if the output returns \"49\" instead. The syntax varies depending on the language.\n\n\nIn some cases, XSS-style attacks can work, which can obscure the root cause if the developer does not closely investigate the root cause of the error.\n\n\nTemplate engines can be used on the server or client, so both \"sides\" could be affected by injection. The mechanisms of attack or the affected technologies might be different, but the mistake is fundamentally the same.\n",
