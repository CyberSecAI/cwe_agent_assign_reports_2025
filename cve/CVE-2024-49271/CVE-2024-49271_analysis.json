The vulnerability description explicitly states this weakness as the root cause. |\n| CWE-77 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary.

CWE-1336 is selected as the primary because the description explicitly mentions \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\". CWE-77 is chosen as a secondary CWE because the **weakness** leads to **command injection**. The abstraction levels were considered, and the Base level for CWE-1336 was deemed appropriate due to the specific context of template engine usage.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe77 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1336 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n    class cwe94,cwe74 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization of special elements** in the template engine (CWE-1336), which leads to the ability to inject commands (CWE-77), ultimately resulting in remote code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis strongly pointed to CWE-1336 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention in the vulnerability description.
