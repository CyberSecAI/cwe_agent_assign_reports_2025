  "description": "An **improper access control** vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically within the versions.patch functionality for updating prompts. Affected versions include 1.2.2 up to but not including 1.2.25. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to update prompt details due to **insufficient access control** checks. This issue was addressed and fixed in version 1.2.25.",
