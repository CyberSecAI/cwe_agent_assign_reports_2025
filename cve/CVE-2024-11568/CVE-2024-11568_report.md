# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-11568

## Description

IrfanView DXF File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24872.

# Summary
| CWE ID  | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CWE-125 | Out-of-bounds Read | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | The vulnerability results in a read past the end of an allocated buffer due to the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**. |
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | **Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** is a high level description of the weakness.|

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read. CWE-20 Improper Input Validation is a parent Class of many input validation related issues, and it broadly applies because the root cause is **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, leading to an out-of-bounds read, and ultimately resulting in remote code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a malicious DXF file, where the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** leads to an **out-of-bounds read**. This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

I am very confident in this assessment because the description explicitly states "**lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer" and the "**weakness:** **Out-Of-Bounds Read**". This makes CWE-125 the most appropriate primary mapping. CWE-20 is secondary, because the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** is a high level description of the weakness.

- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer
**Abstraction Level**: Base

## CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 894.16
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the
         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may
         become a very small or negative number.

**Mapping Guidance**:
