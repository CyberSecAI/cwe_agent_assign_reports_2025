  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved nvme-multipath defer partition scanning We need to suppress the partition scan from occuring within the controllers scan_work context. If a path error occurs here, the IO will wait until a path becomes available or all paths are torn down, but that action also occurs within scan_work, so it would **deadlock**. Defer the partion scan to a different context that does not block scan_work.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2024-53093**.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the partition scan occurring within the controller's `scan_work` context in the NVMe multipath driver. If a path error occurs during the scan, the IO would wait for a path to become available. However, path error handling also occurs within `scan_work`, leading to a potential deadlock.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Deadlock: The core issue is a deadlock condition where the partition scan, waiting for IO path availability, is blocked by the same `scan_work` context that handles path errors, thus preventing the availability of a path.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- System deadlock: Exploiting this vulnerability would cause a system deadlock, rendering the system unresponsive.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Path errors: Triggering a path error during the NVMe multipath partition scan will cause the deadlock.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- Ability to cause path errors: An attacker needs the ability to create path errors within the NVMe multipath subsystem. This is a scenario that can occur within normal system operation, if underlying storage has issues.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- The fix involves deferring the partition scan to a separate workqueue context (`kblockd_schedule_work`) that does not block the controller's `scan_work` context.\n- The fix introduces a new work item `partition_scan_work` and the `GD_SUPPRESS_PART_SCAN` flag.\n- This fix applies to the Linux kernel's NVMe multipath driver.",

While CWE-362 and CWE-667 are classes, CWE-833 is a Base CWE and hence more specific.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe833[\"CWE-833: Deadlock\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n\n    cwe833 -->|PEEROF| cwe667\n    cwe833 -->|PEEROF| cwe362\n    cwe667 -->|PARENT_OF| cwe833\n    cwe362 -->|PARENT_OF| cwe833\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe833 primary\n    class cwe667,cwe362 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain involves a partition scan occurring within the `scan_work` context. If a path error occurs, the IO waits for path availability, but path error handling also occurs within `scan_work`, leading to a **deadlock**.\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Deadlock** (CWE-833) due to concurrent operations within the same context.\n2.  **Contributing Factor:** Improper Locking (CWE-667) of resources, preventing necessary operations.\n3.  **Contributing Factor:** Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (CWE-362)\n4.  **Impact:** System becomes unresponsive due to the deadlock.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis strongly suggests that the primary weakness is CWE-833 **Deadlock**. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **deadlock** condition. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also highlights the **deadlock** as the core issue. The fix involves deferring the partition scan to a different context to avoid blocking the `scan_work` context.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-833 **Deadlock** as a potential candidate, further supporting this assessment.\n\nCWE-667 **Improper Locking** and CWE-362 **Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')** are considered as secondary candidates because they represent the conditions contributing to the deadlock. The system does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors. The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\nThe selection is based on the explicit mention of **deadlock** in the vulnerability description and the root cause analysis provided in the CVE reference links.
