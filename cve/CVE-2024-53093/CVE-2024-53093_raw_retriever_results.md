# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-53093
## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved nvme-multipath defer partition scanning We need to suppress the partition scan from occuring within the controllers scan_work context. If a path error occurs here, the IO will wait until a path becomes available or all paths are torn down, but that action also occurs within scan_work, so it would deadlock. Defer the partion scan to a different context that does not block scan_work.
