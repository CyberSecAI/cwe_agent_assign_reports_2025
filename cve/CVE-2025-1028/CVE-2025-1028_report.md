# Analysis Report for CVE-2025-1028

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-1028

## Description

The Contact Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to **missing file type validation** in the contact form upload feature in all versions up to, and including, 8.6.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible in specific configurations where the first extension is processed over the final. This vulnerability also requires successfully exploiting a **race condition** in order to exploit.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** ['missing file type validation', 'race condition']
- **Impact:** ['arbitrary file uploads', 'remote code execution']
- **Attacker:** unauthenticated attackers
- **Product:** Contact Manager plugin for WordPress
- **Version:** all versions up to and including 8.6.4
- **Component:** contact form upload feature

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-434 | Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-367 | Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is the **missing file type validation** which leads directly to CWE-434. The secondary weakness is the **race condition** which leads to CWE-367. CWE-434 is a base-level CWE, providing a specific description of the vulnerability. The retriever results strongly suggest CWE-434 as the primary candidate, and the description aligns well with the vulnerability. CWE-367 describes the **race condition** that is also present and must be exploited for the **arbitrary file upload** to work.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **missing file type validation** (CWE-434) and a **race condition** (CWE-367). These conditions together allow unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files. If successful, this can lead to remote code execution in specific server configurations.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is clearly the **missing file type validation**, which allows **unrestricted upload of file with dangerous type** (CWE-434). This is supported by the vulnerability description's emphasis on **missing file type validation** as the root cause and by the retriever results that identify CWE-434 as the most relevant CWE. A secondary weakness is the **race condition** (CWE-367) that must be successfully exploited in order for the attack to be successful. Both are at the base level of abstraction.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-178: Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly account for differences in case sensitivity when accessing or determining the properties of a resource, leading to inconsistent results.

- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.



## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are not allowed by policy or otherwise require other action to neutralize before additional processing takes place, but the list is incomplete.
