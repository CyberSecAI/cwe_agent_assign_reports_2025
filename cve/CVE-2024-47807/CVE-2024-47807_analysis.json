  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-47807:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe OpenId Connect Authentication Plugin does not validate the `iss` (Issuer) claim of an ID Token during the authentication flow.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nLack of proper validation of the `iss` claim in the ID Token. This allows the plugin to accept tokens from untrusted Identity Providers.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nAn attacker could potentially subvert the authentication flow and gain unauthorized access to Jenkins, potentially including administrator access.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe attack is performed remotely via network by manipulating the ID token presented during authentication.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nThe attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted ID token to the Jenkins server. This can be achieved with no prior access.\n\n**Affected Plugin:**\nOpenId Connect Authentication Plugin\n\n**Affected versions:**\nUp to and including 4.354.v321ce67a_1de8\n\n**Fixed versions:**\n4.355.v3a_fb_fca_b_96d4\n\n**Additional Note:** When using the \"Manual entry\" configuration mode, the new \"Issuer\" field must be populated after updating to protect from this issue. When using \"Discovery via well-known endpoint\", the Issuer will be set automatically.",

CWE-306 is a child of CWE-287. The analysis leans towards CWE-287 as a more encompassing class, but CWE-306 is considered as the authentication is missing the proper validation of the issuer. The graph relationships influenced the decision to consider both but prioritize CWE-287 as the general class. CWE-807 is also considered as the root cause includes the reliance on the `iss` claim of the ID Token.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe807[\"CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe807 -->|PEEROF| cwe287\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe807 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **the lack of checking the `iss` (Issuer) claim of an ID Token**. This leads to **improper authentication**, allowing attackers to **subvert the authentication flow**, and potentially **gaining administrator access to Jenkins**.\n\nThe chain is:\n1.  **Root Cause**: Missing `iss` claim validation (CWE-287, CWE-306, CWE-807)\n2.  **Impact**: Subverted authentication flow, unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and supporting evidence. The **rootcause** is the **missing check of the `iss` (Issuer) claim of an ID Token**. This directly relates to authentication, as the system **does not properly** verify the identity of the issuer. The CWE guidance helps distinguish between Authentication vs Authorization. Since the core issue is with verifying the identity (Issuer), Authentication-related CWEs are more appropriate.\n\nCWE-287 (Improper Authentication) is chosen as the primary CWE, as it represents the broader class of authentication failures.\nCWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is also considered, as the `iss` claim validation is completely missing.\nCWE-807 (Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision) is also considered because the system relies on the `iss` claim of the ID Token, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, providing a clear representation of the vulnerability while adhering to CWE mapping guidelines.\n\nRelevant CWE
