  "description": "Tenda FH1201 v1.2.0.14 (408) was discovered to contain a **stack overflow** via the PPPOEPassword parameter in the fromAdvSetWan function. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted POST request.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the `decodePwd` function of the Tenda FH1201 router firmware.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- The `decodePwd` function copies data from a source buffer to a destination buffer without proper bounds checking.\n- The size of the destination buffer is fixed (v52 array), while the size of the source buffer (PPPOEPassword) is controlled by the user.\n- When the user-supplied `PPPOEPassword` is larger than the destination buffer `v52`, it overwrites adjacent memory on the stack.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- A successful exploit allows an attacker to overwrite stack memory, which could lead to:\n    - Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the device.\n    - Remote Code Execution (RCE) by overwriting return addresses on the stack with attacker controlled addresses.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/AdvSetWan` endpoint.\n- The POST request must include the \"wanmode\" parameter set to \"2\", and a \"PPPOEPassword\" parameter containing the overflow payload.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router. This could be from the local network or, depending on the router configuration, potentially from the internet.\n- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint and the required parameters to trigger the vulnerable code path.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The content provides a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit script that demonstrates how to trigger the buffer overflow.\n- The content also includes the disassembly of the vulnerable `decodePwd` function, which helps understand the vulnerability.\n- The vulnerability is located in the Tenda FH1201 Firmware V1.2.0.14(408).",

This leads to an **out-of-bounds write**, which causes a denial-of-service. The root cause is the stack overflow, which has CWE-121 as its best match.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a **stack overflow** vulnerability in Tenda FH1201. The `decodePwd` function copies the `PPPOEPassword` parameter to a stack buffer `v52` without proper bounds checking. If the `PPPOEPassword` is larger than `v52`, it overflows the buffer, leading to a denial of service.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) because the overflow occurs on the stack. The \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section lists CWE-787 as the primary match, but since this a stack overflow, CWE-121 is preferred.\n\nCWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) is considered as a secondary CWE, since it's the result of the stack overflow.\n\nCWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) is a class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-121 and CWE-787. It is a broader category that encompasses buffer overflows and out-of-bounds writes.\n\nThe selection of CWE-121 is based on the specific location of the buffer overflow (stack), which makes it a more precise classification than CWE-787 or CWE-119.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 3.30\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-825\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-824\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-823\n- CANFOLLOW -> CWE-822\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-124\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.216\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently control operations within the memory buffer, which could lead to read, write, or control operations outside of the intended boundaries of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\nCWEs not selected:\n\n- CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound: Not relevant as there is no integer overflow mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n- CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion: Not relevant as there is no recursion mentioned in the vulnerability description.\n- CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling: Not relevant as the vulnerability is not related to resource allocation.\n- CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow: Not relevant as the buffer overflow occurs on the stack, not the heap.\n- CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input: While the vulnerability involves a buffer overflow, the root cause is not the improper validation of the input size, but the lack of bounds checking during the copy operation.\n- CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read: Not relevant as the vulnerability involves an out-of-bounds write, not read.\n- CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password: Not relevant as there are no hardcoded passwords in the description.\n- CWE-128: Wrap-around Error: Not relevant as there is no wrap-around error in the description.",
