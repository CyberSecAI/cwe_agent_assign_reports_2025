  "description": "go-gh is a Go module for interacting with the `gh` utility and the GitHub API from the command line. A security vulnerability has been identified in `go-gh` that could leak authentication tokens intended for GitHub hosts to non-GitHub hosts when within a codespace. `go-gh` sources authentication tokens from different environment variables depending on the host involved 1. `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN` for GitHub.com and ghe.com and 2. `GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN`, `GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN` for GitHub Enterprise Server. Prior to version `2.11.1`, `auth.TokenForHost` could source a token from the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable for a host other than GitHub.com or ghe.com when within a codespace. In version `2.11.1`, `auth.TokenForHost` will only source a token from the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable for GitHub.com or ghe.com hosts. Successful exploitation could send authentication token to an unintended host. This issue has been addressed in version 2.11.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. Users are also advised to regenerate authentication tokens and to review their personal security log and any relevant audit logs for actions associated with their account or enterprise.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-53859:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability lies within the `auth.TokenForHost` function of the `go-gh` library. This function, responsible for retrieving authentication tokens, incorrectly sourced tokens from the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable for hosts other than `github.com` or `ghe.com` when running within a codespace.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Incorrect token sourcing:** The `auth.TokenForHost` function was not properly checking the host before sourcing tokens from `GITHUB_TOKEN`, potentially leaking tokens intended for `github.com` or `ghe.com` to other hosts.\n- **Environment variable confusion:** The vulnerability stems from how the application handles the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable in the context of codespaces, where it could be unintentionally exposed to untrusted hosts.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Token Leakage:** Successful exploitation could result in the exposure of sensitive authentication tokens to unintended hosts. These tokens could be used to gain unauthorized access to resources on the actual GitHub host they were intended for.\n- **Potential Data Breach:** Depending on the permissions associated with the leaked token, an attacker could read or modify sensitive data.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Codespace Environment:** The primary attack vector involves exploiting the vulnerability within a GitHub codespace.\n- **Unintended Host:** The attacker needs to be in a position to receive the leaked token, which would be through the unintended host.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Usage of `go-gh` within a codespace:** The attacker must be able to trigger the `auth.TokenForHost` function within a codespace environment.\n- **Ability to receive leaked tokens:** The attacker must control a non-GitHub host that `go-gh` attempts to communicate with and can receive the leaked token if the vulnerability is exploited.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n- The vulnerability is specific to versions of `go-gh` prior to `2.11.1`.\n- The fix implemented in `2.11.1` ensures that `GITHUB_TOKEN` is only sourced for `github.com` or `ghe.com` hosts.\n- The vulnerability is rated as \"Moderate\" severity with a CVSS v3 score of 6.5.\n- The attack complexity is considered \"High\", requiring a specific setup of an attacker-controlled host in a codespace.\n- The vulnerability has a scope of \"Unchanged\" meaning that the vulnerable component does not impact the security of components beyond its scope.\n- The confidentiality and integrity impact of the vulnerability are \"High\".\n- The availability impact of the vulnerability is \"Low\".\n- Users are advised to upgrade to `go-gh` version `2.11.1` and regenerate authentication tokens including Personal Access Tokens and GitHub CLI OAuth app authorizations.\n- Users should also review their security logs for any suspicious activity.",

While CWE-212 is a parent of CWE-201, the specific vulnerability focuses on the insertion of sensitive information into sent data (CWE-201) rather than the general failure to remove it before transfer (CWE-212).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe201 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe212\n    cwe212 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe201\n    cwe201 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe306\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of environment variables** in the `go-gh` library, leading to the **inclusion of sensitive authentication tokens** in requests to unintended hosts.\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper handling of environment variables** in `auth.TokenForHost` leading to tokens being sourced from `GITHUB_TOKEN` for unintended hosts.\n2.  **Weakness:** **Insertion of sensitive authentication tokens** into requests to non-GitHub hosts (CWE-201).\n3.  **Impact:** Potential unauthorized access to GitHub resources if the leaked token is intercepted and misused.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the specific weakness. The evidence clearly points to the **leakage of authentication tokens** due to the **incorrect sourcing of tokens** for unintended hosts when using codespaces.\n\nThe primary CWE, CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data), was chosen because it accurately describes the core issue: sensitive tokens are being included in data sent to unintended hosts. This is supported by the vulnerability description, which states that \"go-gh could leak authentication tokens intended for GitHub hosts to non-GitHub hosts when within a codespace\" and that successful exploitation could \"send authentication token to an unintended host.\"\n\nWhile other CWEs like CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) were considered, they were deemed less appropriate. The issue isn't a complete lack of authentication, but rather the **leakage of existing authentication tokens** to the wrong recipients.\n\nThe final decision was strongly influenced by the evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE summary, which highlights the incorrect sourcing of tokens and the subsequent leakage. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, accurately representing the technical details of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
