# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-55555

## Vulnerability Description
Invoice Ninja before 5.10.43 allows remote code execution from a pre-authenticated route when an attacker knows the APP_KEY. This is exacerbated by .env files, available from the products repository, that have default APP_KEY values. The route/{hash} route defined in the invoiceninja/routes/client.php file can be accessed without authentication. The parameter {hash} is passed to the function decrypt that expects a Laravel ciphered value containing a serialized object. (Furthermore, Laravel contains several gadget chains usable to trigger remote command execution from arbitrary **deserialization**.) Therefore, an attacker in possession of the APP_KEY is able to fully control a string passed to an unserialize function.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **deserialization**
- **impact:** remote command execution and remote code execution
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Invoice Ninja
- **version:** before 5.10.43
- **component:** route/{hash} route

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2024-55555 based on provided content

The provided content from synacktiv.com details two vulnerabilities in InvoiceNinja, which align with the CVE description. Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**1. Root Cause:**

*   **Default APP\_KEY:** Several `.env` templates in the InvoiceNinja GitHub repository contain default values for the `APP_KEY` environment variable. This allows attackers to potentially exploit the second vulnerability if a user doesn't generate a unique key.
*   **Unsafe Deserialization:** The `/route/{hash}` route decrypts a user-controlled value using Laravel's `decrypt()` function, which by default unserializes the data. This allows for remote code execution if the attacker has access to the `APP_KEY`.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:**  The use of `unserialize()` on potentially untrusted data without proper validation.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The presence of default `APP_KEY` values in publicly accessible repository files.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The `/route/{hash}` route is accessible without authentication.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An unauthenticated attacker with access to the `APP_KEY` can execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker can exploit the `/route/{hash}` endpoint by providing a crafted payload that, when decrypted and unserialized, executes malicious code.
*   The attacker needs to obtain the `APP_KEY`, which could be through the default values in the repository or other means.
*   The `laravel-crypto-killer` and `phpggc` tools are mentioned as being used to generate and exploit the vulnerability.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to know or be able to discover the `APP_KEY`.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the `/route/{hash}` endpoint.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of PHP deserialization vulnerabilities and Laravel's encryption mechanisms.

**6. Mitigation/Fix:**

*   **Upgrade:** Upgrade InvoiceNinja to version 5.10.11 or greater.
*   **Generate Unique APP\_KEY:** If using a self-hosted instance, ensure a unique `APP_KEY` is generated using the `php artisan key:generate` command and *not* using the default values from the `.env` templates.

**Additional Details (More than CVE Description):**

*   The advisory provides a detailed timeline of discovery and patching.
*   It includes specific commit links to the vulnerable code and the fix.
*   It details the tools used for exploitation (laravel-crypto-killer, phpggc).
*   It provides a video demonstrating the exploitation process.
*   The advisory also mentions the use of the XSRF-TOKEN cookie in the exploitation process.

**In summary, the content provides a comprehensive analysis of the vulnerability, going beyond the basic information typically found in a CVE description.**

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
