## Vulnerability Description
Buffer Overflow in coap_msg.c in FreeCoAP allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (**stack buffer overflow**) via a crafted packet.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack buffer overflow**
- **impact:** execute arbitrary code and denial of service
- **vector:** crafted packet
- **attacker:** remote attackers
- **product:** FreeCoAP
- **component:** coap_msg.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `coap_msg.c` file of the FreeCoAP library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack buffer overflow:** Specifically, a stack buffer overflow occurs within the `coap_msg_parse_ops` function, which is also related to `coap_msg_parse`, `coap_server_trans_recv`, `coap_server_exchange`, and `coap_server_run` functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The overflow can also cause a denial of service by crashing the application due to the stack corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack is performed remotely by sending a malicious packet.
*   **Crafted Packet:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted packet to the CoAP server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to a server running a vulnerable version of FreeCoAP.
*   The attacker needs to create and send a specifically crafted packet to trigger the buffer overflow.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
*   The vulnerability is present in FreeCoAP version 0.7.
*   Detailed steps to reproduce the issue are available at the provided github link: https://github.com/dqp10515/security/tree/main/FreeCoAP_bug
