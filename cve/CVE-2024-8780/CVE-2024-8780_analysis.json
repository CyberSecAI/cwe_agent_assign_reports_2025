CWE-202, Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries, is a secondary CWE, representing the impact of the **incorrect authorization** leading to the exposure of sensitive user data.

This **incorrect authorization** leads to the exposure of sensitive information through data queries (CWE-202), specifically accounts and password hashes of other users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability based on the provided description. The key phrase \"**does not properly restrict the query range**\" strongly suggests an **authorization** issue, leading to the selection of CWE-863.\n\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization) was considered but ultimately rejected because it is discouraged and more specific options exist.\n\nCWE-202 was selected as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability results in the exposure of sensitive information.\n\nThe final selection is based on the available evidence, with CWE-863 representing the **root cause** and CWE-202 representing the impact. The level of specificity is limited by the information provided in the vulnerability description.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1345.67\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.40\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-202: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- CHILDOF -> CWE-1230\n- CANALSOBE -> CWE-202\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-202",
