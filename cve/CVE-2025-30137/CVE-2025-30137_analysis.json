  "description": "An issue was discovered in the G-Net GNET APK 2.6.2. Hardcoded credentials exist in in APK for ports 9091 and 9092. The GNET mobile application contains ****hardcoded credentials**** that provide unauthorized access to the dashcams API endpoints on ports 9091 and 9092. Once the GNET SSID is connected to, the attacker sends a crafted authentication command with TibetList and 000000 to list settings of the dashcam at port 9091. Theres a separate set of credentials for port 9092 (stream) that is also exposed in cleartext admin + tibet. For settings, the required credentials are adim + 000000.",

Here's an extraction of the relevant details:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-30137\n\n**Vulnerability:** Hardcoded credentials in APK to ports 9091 (API) and 9092 (RTSP)\n\n**Root Cause:** The GNET G-ONX dashcam\u2019s Android APK (GNET v2.6.2) contains hardcoded credentials.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n*   Hardcoded credentials.\n*   Exposure of sensitive data (credentials) in the APK.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   Unauthorized access to device settings.\n*   Potential for remote control and data theft.\n*   Access to live video stream.\n*   Ability to remotely dump video footage.\n*   Extraction of sensitive data (location).\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   Network access to the dashcam's SSID.\n*   Sending crafted commands to port 9091 (\"TibetList\" and \"000\\*\") to retrieve device settings.\n*   Exploiting hardcoded credentials for port 9092 (\"admin\" + \"tib\\*\" for stream, \"adim\" + \"000\\*\" for settings).\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   Access to the dashcam\u2019s network (connected to the SSID).\n*   Basic networking knowledge to send commands to specific ports.\n*   Knowledge of the hardcoded credentials.\n\n**Mitigation/Fix:**\n*   The content does not explicitly state a fix, but implies the need to remove hardcoded credentials from the APK and implement secure authentication mechanisms.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The affected product is the GNET G-ONX dashcam.\n*   The affected APK version is GNET v2.6.2.\n*   Specific commands and credentials used for exploitation are provided.\n*   The vulnerability allows for dumping video footage, accessing live streams, and extracting location data.",

While the vulnerability description specifies hardcoded credentials, it doesn't explicitly state whether these are passwords or cryptographic keys. Therefore, the base CWE-798 is the most appropriate choice. The secondary CWE-306 was considered because the hardcoded credentials effectively bypass authentication, but since the core issue is the presence of the hardcoded credentials themselves, it is secondary.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe798 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n    class cwe259,cwe321 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **hardcoded credentials** (CWE-798), leading to **missing authentication** (CWE-306), and ultimately resulting in unauthorized access to the dashcam's API endpoints.\n  - Root Cause: CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n  - Weakness: CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n  - Impact: Unauthorized access to dashcam API endpoints\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and subsequent impacts of the vulnerability. The presence of **hardcoded credentials** is explicitly stated in the vulnerability description and confirmed by the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" further reinforces this finding. The graph relationships helped clarify the hierarchical relationships between CWE-798 and its child CWEs, influencing the choice of the base CWE as the most appropriate.\n\nThe decision to select CWE-798 as the primary CWE is strongly supported by the evidence. The vulnerability description clearly states the existence of **hardcoded credentials**, and this aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-798. The abstraction level (Base) is also appropriate, as it represents the core weakness without being overly specific about the type of credential. The choice of CWE-798 is at the optimal level of specificity because the description does not contain enough information to determine if the credential is a password (CWE-259) or cryptographic key (CWE-321).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n**Abstraction Level**: base\n**Similarity Score**: 2.47\n**Source**: graph\n\n**Description**:\nCWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
