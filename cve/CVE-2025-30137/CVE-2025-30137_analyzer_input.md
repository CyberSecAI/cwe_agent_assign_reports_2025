# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-30137

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in the G-Net GNET APK 2.6.2. Hardcoded credentials exist in in APK for ports 9091 and 9092. The GNET mobile application contains ****hardcoded credentials**** that provide unauthorized access to the dashcams API endpoints on ports 9091 and 9092. Once the GNET SSID is connected to, the attacker sends a crafted authentication command with TibetList and 000000 to list settings of the dashcam at port 9091. Theres a separate set of credentials for port 9092 (stream) that is also exposed in cleartext admin + tibet. For settings, the required credentials are adim + 000000.

## Analysis of CVE-2025-30137 based on provided content

The provided content contains detailed information about CVE-2025-30137, significantly more than the placeholder description. Here's an extraction of the relevant details:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-30137

**Vulnerability:** Hardcoded credentials in APK to ports 9091 (API) and 9092 (RTSP)

**Root Cause:** The GNET G-ONX dashcam’s Android APK (GNET v2.6.2) contains hardcoded credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Hardcoded credentials.
*   Exposure of sensitive data (credentials) in the APK.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Unauthorized access to device settings.
*   Potential for remote control and data theft.
*   Access to live video stream.
*   Ability to remotely dump video footage.
*   Extraction of sensitive data (location).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Network access to the dashcam's SSID.
*   Sending crafted commands to port 9091 ("TibetList" and "000\*") to retrieve device settings.
*   Exploiting hardcoded credentials for port 9092 ("admin" + "tib\*" for stream, "adim" + "000\*" for settings).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Access to the dashcam’s network (connected to the SSID).
*   Basic networking knowledge to send commands to specific ports.
*   Knowledge of the hardcoded credentials.

**Mitigation/Fix:**
*   The content does not explicitly state a fix, but implies the need to remove hardcoded credentials from the APK and implement secure authentication mechanisms.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The affected product is the GNET G-ONX dashcam.
*   The affected APK version is GNET v2.6.2.
*   Specific commands and credentials used for exploitation are provided.
*   The vulnerability allows for dumping video footage, accessing live streams, and extracting location data.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| No identity check (no login)                               | CWE-306        |
| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
