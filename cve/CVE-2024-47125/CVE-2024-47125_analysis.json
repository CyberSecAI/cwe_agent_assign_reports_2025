The application **does not verify the cryptographic signature** of the public keys. |\n| CWE-295 | Improper Certificate Validation | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | The vulnerability description indicates that the application **does not authenticate public keys**, which is related to certificate validation. |\n| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | This is a secondary consideration because the **lack of public key authentication** could also be viewed as missing authentication for a critical function related to message integrity. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-347, which is a child of CWE-345 (Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity). CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) is related as public key authentication often involves certificate validation. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is a broader category that could apply since public key authentication is a critical function.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe347[\"CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature\"]\n    cwe345[\"CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\"]\n    cwe295[\"CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n\n    cwe347 -->|CHILDOF| cwe345\n    cwe347 -->|PEEROF| cwe295\n    cwe347 -->|PEEROF| cwe306\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe347 primary\n    class cwe295,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of public key authentication** (CWE-347), leading to the ability to manipulate messages.

This **lack of authentication** allows an attacker to manipulate messages. The supporting evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that \"The goTenna Pro App **does not authenticate public keys** which allows an unauthenticated attacker to manipulate messages.\" The retriever results also suggest related CWEs such as CWE-295 and CWE-306, which are considered as secondary mappings due to their relevance to the **lack of public key authentication**.\n\nCWE-347 is the most specific and appropriate CWE because it directly addresses the **improper verification of cryptographic signatures**. This aligns with the vulnerability description's focus on the **lack of public key authentication**.\n\nCWE-295 was considered because the **lack of public key authentication** can relate to the **improper validation of certificates.**\nCWE-306 was considered since **missing authentication** for the critical function of verifying messages is a valid secondary classification.\n\nCWE-327, CWE-522, CWE-321, CWE-325, CWE-209, CWE-287, CWE-301, and CWE-208 were not selected because they are less directly related to the **lack of public key authentication**.\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.65\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.65\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.65\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
