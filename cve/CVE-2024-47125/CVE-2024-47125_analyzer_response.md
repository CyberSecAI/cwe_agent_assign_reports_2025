# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2024-47125

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-347 | Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The application **does not verify the cryptographic signature** of the public keys. |
| CWE-295 | Improper Certificate Validation | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | The vulnerability description indicates that the application **does not authenticate public keys**, which is related to certificate validation. |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | This is a secondary consideration because the **lack of public key authentication** could also be viewed as missing authentication for a critical function related to message integrity. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-347, which is a child of CWE-345 (Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity). CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) is related as public key authentication often involves certificate validation. CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is a broader category that could apply since public key authentication is a critical function.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of public key authentication** (CWE-347), leading to the ability to manipulate messages. The chain is: **CWE-347** -> Impact: Message Manipulation.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified CWE-347 as the primary weakness because the vulnerability description explicitly states that the goTenna Pro App **does not authenticate public keys**. This **lack of authentication** allows an attacker to manipulate messages. The supporting evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that "The goTenna Pro App **does not authenticate public keys** which allows an unauthenticated attacker to manipulate messages." The retriever results also suggest related CWEs such as CWE-295 and CWE-306, which are considered as secondary mappings due to their relevance to the **lack of public key authentication**.

CWE-347 is the most specific and appropriate CWE because it directly addresses the **improper verification of cryptographic signatures**. This aligns with the vulnerability description's focus on the **lack of public key authentication**.

CWE-295 was considered because the **lack of public key authentication** can relate to the **improper validation of certificates.**
CWE-306 was considered since **missing authentication** for the critical function of verifying messages is a valid secondary classification.

CWE-327, CWE-522, CWE-321, CWE-325, CWE-209, CWE-287, CWE-301, and CWE-208 were not selected because they are less directly related to the **lack of public key authentication**.
# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.66
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.65
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.65
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.65
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.64
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.64
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.

**Mapping Guidance**:

**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.63
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).

**Mapping Guidance**:
