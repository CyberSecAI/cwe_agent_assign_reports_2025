The vulnerability allows remote attackers to obtain password hashes due to the use of a hashing scheme that doesn't provide sufficient computational effort. |\n| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.5 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. The vulnerability leads to exposure of password hashes, which constitutes sensitive information. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-916, which is a base-level CWE. It is related to CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor), as the **insufficient hashing effort** leads to the exposure of sensitive password hashes. However, CWE-200 is a class-level CWE and is discouraged for use as a primary mapping.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe916[\"CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe916 -->|CANLEADTO| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe916 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a password hash with insufficient computational effort (CWE-916)**, which then leads to the **exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200)**, specifically password hashes, to unauthorized actors.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The description clearly states that remote attackers can obtain password hashes, indicating a weakness in the hashing mechanism.\n\nThe selection of CWE-916 is based on the vulnerability description stating that remote attackers can obtain password hashes, indicating the **use of a password hash with insufficient computational effort**. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-916.\n\nCWE-200 was considered because the exposure of password hashes constitutes exposure of sensitive information. However, CWE-200 is a class-level CWE and is discouraged as a primary mapping when more specific base-level CWEs are available. Furthermore, it describes the impact rather than the root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
