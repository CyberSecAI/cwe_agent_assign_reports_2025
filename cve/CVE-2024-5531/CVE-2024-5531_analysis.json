  "description": "The Ocean Extra plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Flickr widget in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.8 due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-5531\n\n**Root Cause:**\n*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the Ocean Extra plugin's Flickr widget. Specifically, the plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied attributes before rendering them in the Flickr widget.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. This means that malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the widget's settings and stored in the database. The injected code then executes when a user views a page containing the affected widget.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts (JavaScript) into web pages.\n*   **Potential for Malicious Actions:** This can lead to various malicious actions, such as:\n    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites\n    *   Stealing user session cookies\n    *   Modifying page content\n    *   Performing actions on behalf of the logged-in user\n    *   Any other actions achievable with JavaScript execution in the browser.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Flickr Widget:** The vulnerability is located in the Flickr widget of the Ocean Extra plugin.\n*   **User-Supplied Attributes:** The vulnerability is triggered through user-provided attributes within the widget's settings, specifically the `id` parameter which represents the Flickr user ID.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least \"contributor\" level access. This means they must have the ability to modify content/widgets within WordPress.\n*   **Access to Widget Settings:** The attacker must be able to access the settings of the Flickr widget to inject the malicious script via the `id` field.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n*   The vulnerable code is located in `includes/widgets/flickr.php` of the plugin.\n*   The specific line of code where the vulnerable ID is rendered is `line 58`, where it uses `strip_tags` instead of `esc_attr` or similar function for output escaping.\n*   The fix involved updating the plugin to version 2.2.9.",

There are several potential parent or child relationships, such as CWE-113 [Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')] or CWE-80 [Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)], but the description does not provide enough information to select a more specific variant. The other Class level CWEs such as CWE-138 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements] and CWE-116 [Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output] are less specific and are therefore not as good a fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe79 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** of user-supplied attributes in the Flickr widget, leading to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). An attacker injects arbitrary web scripts via the `id` parameter of the Flickr widget, which are then executed when a user views the page, leading to potential malicious actions.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary weakness is clearly **cross-site scripting** due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**. The evidence supports this with phrases like \"**insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes**\". The vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary both explicitly mention stored XSS. The CVE summary further specifies that the vulnerable code is in `includes/widgets/flickr.php` and that `strip_tags` is used instead of `esc_attr` or similar escaping function.\n\nCWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] is the best fit because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **improper neutralization of user-controllable input** before it is placed in a web page. This aligns perfectly with the description of the vulnerability.\n\nThe other CWEs were considered but not selected because they are either too general (e.g., CWE-20 [Improper Input Validation]), address a different type of vulnerability (e.g., CWE-89 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')]), or are at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., CWE-138 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements]).\nCWE-116 [Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output] is a Class level CWE and is less specific than CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')].\nCWE-352 [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] is not relevant because the vulnerability is not related to CSRF.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n*   CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')]\n    *   The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n    *   This aligns perfectly with the vulnerability description, which mentions **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** on user-supplied attributes.",
