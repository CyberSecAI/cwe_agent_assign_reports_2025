This leads to **CWE-79** [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')], where the injected script is stored and executed when other users view the affected content.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates that the primary vulnerability is **CWE-79** [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] because the application fails to properly neutralize user-supplied input, leading to a stored XSS. The **CSRF** [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] vulnerability, **CWE-352**, enables the XSS.

The retriever results also list **CWE-79** [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] as the top candidate. The evidence supports the selection of **CWE-79** [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] as the primary CWE due to the Stored XSS. **CWE-352** [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)] is a secondary vulnerability due to the application's failure to verify the origin of the request.
