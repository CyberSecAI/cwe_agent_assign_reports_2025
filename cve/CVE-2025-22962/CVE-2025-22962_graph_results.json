  "query": "A critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in the web-based management interface of GatesAir Maxiva UAXT, VAXT transmitters when debugging mode is enabled. An attacker with a valid session ID (sess_id) can send specially crafted POST requests to the /json endpoint, enabling arbitrary command execution on the underlying system. This vulnerability can lead to full system compromise, including unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and potentially full device takeover.",
