  "description": "RestrictedPython is a restricted execution environment for Python to run untrusted code. A user can gain access to protected (and potentially sensible) information indirectly via AttributeError.obj and the string module. The problem will be fixed in version 7.3. As a workaround, If the application does not require access to the module string, it can remove it from RestrictedPython.Utilities.utility_builtins or otherwise do not make it available in the restricted execution environment.",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the way `RestrictedPython` handles `AttributeError` exceptions and its interaction with the `string` module. Specifically, the `AttributeError` object was exposing a reference to the underlying object that caused the exception via `AttributeError.obj`, potentially leaking internal information. Additionally, the `string` module was being exposed in a way that could be leveraged for unintended access.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Information Leakage via `AttributeError.obj`:** The `AttributeError` exception object contained a reference to the object on which the attribute access failed (`e.obj = self`). This could be used to access protected or sensitive information.\n*   **Unrestricted Access to `string` module:** The `string` module, when exposed without proper restriction, could be exploited to gain access to more of the underlying Python environment than intended.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\nAn attacker could potentially gain access to protected (and potentially sensitive) information by:\n\n1.  Triggering an `AttributeError` in a restricted environment.\n2.  Accessing the `obj` attribute of the `AttributeError` object.\n3.  Leveraging the leaked object reference and the available methods in the `string` module or related objects to gain additional information or perform unauthorized operations.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   By crafting malicious input that triggers an `AttributeError` within the restricted environment.\n*   By leveraging the unrestricted access to the `string` module in the restricted context.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code or control the input within a `RestrictedPython` environment that is vulnerable (versions < 7.3).\n*   The attacker must be able to access or interact with the `string` module, or cause an `AttributeError` to occur on a `_AttributeDelegator` object.\n\n**Additional Details from the Patch:**\n\nThe fix implemented in commit `d701cc36cccac36b21fa200f1f2d1945a9a215e6` addresses the vulnerability by:\n\n*   Modifying the `_AttributeDelegator.__getattr__` method to no longer set the `obj` attribute on `AttributeError`.\n*   Restricting access to the `string` module by providing only a restricted view of it (as an `_AttributeDelegator` object) rather than the module itself.\n\nThis ensures that the `AttributeError` does not leak the object reference, and direct access to the `string` module is no longer possible.",

The final decision was heavily influenced by the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which clearly indicated that the vulnerability allowed a user to **gain access to protected information**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-497 is based on the fact that it directly addresses the **exposure of sensitive system information**. This is supported by the vulnerability description key phrases, which highlight the **weakness** as the ability to **gain access to protected information**. The fix implemented in the patch, which modifies the `_AttributeDelegator.__getattr__` method to no longer set the `obj` attribute on `AttributeError` and restricts access to the `string` module, further supports this classification.\n\nCWE-668 was considered because it generally describes the **exposure of a resource to the wrong control sphere**. While this is a valid concern, CWE-497 is more specific in that it focuses on the **exposure of sensitive system information**. Since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions sensitive information, CWE-497 is a better fit.\n\nCWE-201 was considered because the vulnerability results in insertion of sensitive information. While this is true, the primary issue is not the insertion of the data, but the initial **exposure** of the sensitive information.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause and the resulting impact of the vulnerability. The evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary supports this classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n\n**Technical Explanation:** The `RestrictedPython` environment exposes internal object references through `AttributeError.obj` and the `string` module, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n\n**Security Implications:** Unauthorized access to sensitive system information can lead to further exploitation, privilege escalation, or data breaches.\n\n**Parent-Child Relationships:** CWE-497 is a base-level CWE and a child of CWE-668.\n\n**Primary/Secondary:** Primary CWE\n\n**Mitre Mapping Guidance:** Allowed. The CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n\n**Technical Explanation:** The `RestrictedPython` environment allows resources (internal object references, `string` module) to be accessed by actors who should not have access to them, thus exposing them to the wrong sphere of control.\n\n**Security Implications:** Unauthorized access to resources can lead to privilege escalation, data breaches, or other security compromises.\n\n**Parent-Child Relationships:** CWE-668 is a class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-497.\n\n**Primary/Secondary:** Secondary CWE\n\n**Mitre Mapping Guidance:** Discouraged.
