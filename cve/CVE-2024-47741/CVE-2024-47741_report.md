# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-47741

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved btrfs fix race setting file private on concurrent lseek using same fd When doing concurrent lseek(2) system calls against the same file descriptor, using multiple threads belonging to the same process, we have a short time window where a race happens and can result in a **memory leak**. The race happens like this 1) A program opens a file descriptor for a file and then spawns two threads (with the pthreads library for example), lets call them task A and task B 2) Task A calls lseek with SEEK_DATA or SEEK_HOLE and ends up at file.cfind_desired_extent() while holding a read lock on the inode 3) At the start of find_desired_extent(), it extracts the files private_data pointer into a local variable named private, which has a value of NULL 4) Task B also calls lseek with SEEK_DATA or SEEK_HOLE, locks the inode in shared mode and enters file.cfind_desired_extent(), where it also extracts file->private_data into its local variable private, which has a NULL value 5) Because it saw a NULL file private, task A allocates a private structure and assigns to the file structure 6) Task B also saw a NULL file private so it also allocates its own file private and then assigns it to the same file structure, since both tasks are using the same file descriptor. At this point we leak the private structure allocated by task A. Besides the **memory leak**, theres also the detail

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-362 | Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') | 1.0 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE. The vulnerability is due to a **race condition** when multiple threads access a shared resource. |
| CWE-401 | Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The **memory leak** occurs because a private structure allocated by one task is overwritten by another without being released. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a memory leak (CWE-401). CWE-362 is a Class-level CWE, and there might be more specific Base-level children, but given the information, CWE-362 accurately captures the concurrent execution issue. CWE-401 represents the consequence of the race condition, where memory is not released after its effective lifetime.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with concurrent `lseek` system calls, leading to a race condition when accessing `file->private_data` without proper synchronization. This results in a memory leak because private structures allocated by different threads are not released. The race condition (CWE-362) is the root cause, and the memory leak (CWE-401) is a direct consequence.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis identifies a race condition (CWE-362) as the primary cause of a memory leak (CWE-401) in the Linux kernel when handling concurrent `lseek` system calls. The **race condition** occurs because multiple threads access `file->private_data` without proper synchronization, leading to a **memory leak** when one thread overwrites the private data structure allocated by another thread.

The evidence from the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" and "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" directly supports this classification. The root cause is explicitly mentioned as a "race condition", and the weakness is described as a "memory leak". The provided content also details the steps leading to the memory leak.

CWE-362 is chosen as the primary CWE because it represents the fundamental flaw that triggers the vulnerability. CWE-401 is a secondary CWE that describes the resulting memory leak. The selection of these CWEs is based on the evidence provided and the official MITRE mapping guidance.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
If two threads of execution use a resource simultaneously, there exists the possibility that resources may be used while invalid, in turn making the state of execution undefined.
