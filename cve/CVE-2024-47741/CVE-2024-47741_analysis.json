  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved btrfs fix race setting file private on concurrent lseek using same fd When doing concurrent lseek(2) system calls against the same file descriptor, using multiple threads belonging to the same process, we have a short time window where a race happens and can result in a **memory leak**. The race happens like this 1) A program opens a file descriptor for a file and then spawns two threads (with the pthreads library for example), lets call them task A and task B 2) Task A calls lseek with SEEK_DATA or SEEK_HOLE and ends up at file.cfind_desired_extent() while holding a read lock on the inode 3) At the start of find_desired_extent(), it extracts the files private_data pointer into a local variable named private, which has a value of NULL 4) Task B also calls lseek with SEEK_DATA or SEEK_HOLE, locks the inode in shared mode and enters file.cfind_desired_extent(), where it also extracts file->private_data into its local variable private, which has a NULL value 5) Because it saw a NULL file private, task A allocates a private structure and assigns to the file structure 6) Task B also saw a NULL file private so it also allocates its own file private and then assigns it to the same file structure, since both tasks are using the same file descriptor. At this point we leak the private structure allocated by task A. Besides the **memory leak**, theres also the detail",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe root cause of this vulnerability lies in a race condition that occurs when multiple threads within the same process concurrently call `lseek(2)` with `SEEK_DATA` or `SEEK_HOLE` on the same file descriptor in the BTRFS filesystem. This race condition leads to a memory leak and potential use-after-free issues.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n1.  **Race condition:** Concurrent access to the `file->private_data` without proper synchronization.\n2.  **Memory leak:** Multiple threads can allocate private data structures, but only the last assignment is kept, causing a leak.\n3.  **Use-after-free:** The `llseek_cached_state` within the private data structure can be freed by one task while another task might still be using it.\n4.  **Incorrect cached state:** Sharing the cached state between threads can lead to incorrect results, although the provided information indicates this is not currently a major issue.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n1.  **Memory leak:** Repeated exploitation could lead to memory exhaustion.\n2.  **Use-after-free:** This could result in application crashes or potentially be exploited for more serious vulnerabilities.\n3. **Incorrect results:** Although not immediately exploitable, it can cause unexpected behavior from the lseek function.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n1.  A malicious or buggy application can open a file descriptor to a btrfs file and then spawn multiple threads.\n2.  Each thread calls `lseek(2)` with `SEEK_DATA` or `SEEK_HOLE` on the same file descriptor.\n3.  The race condition occurs within the kernel during the handling of these concurrent calls.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n1.  The attacker needs the ability to create and execute multi-threaded programs that perform `lseek(2)` on files residing on a BTRFS filesystem.\n2.  The attacker must be able to open and operate on the same file descriptor from multiple threads belonging to the same process.\n\n**Additional details from the provided content:**\n\n-   The vulnerability occurs specifically in the `file.c:find_desired_extent()` function when handling `lseek(2)` with `SEEK_DATA` or `SEEK_HOLE` on BTRFS files.\n-   The issue is due to the lack of synchronization when allocating and assigning the `file->private_data`, which holds cached state information for `lseek` operations.\n-   The fix involves acquiring the inode's spinlock before accessing/modifying the `file->private_data` and checking if the current task is the owner of the private data structure. If not, then reallocating it for the current task.\n- The fix also includes adding `owner_task` to the `btrfs_file_private` struct to track the task that allocated the private data structure.\n-   The vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions 6.6 and later.",

The vulnerability is due to a **race condition** when multiple threads access a shared resource. |\n| CWE-401 | Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The **memory leak** occurs because a private structure allocated by one task is overwritten by another without being released. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.95\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is a race condition (CWE-362) that leads to a memory leak (CWE-401). CWE-362 is a Class-level CWE, and there might be more specific Base-level children, but given the information, CWE-362 accurately captures the concurrent execution issue. CWE-401 represents the consequence of the race condition, where memory is not released after its effective lifetime.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n\n    cwe401 -->|RESULT_OF| cwe362\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe401 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with concurrent `lseek` system calls, leading to a race condition when accessing `file->private_data` without proper synchronization. This results in a memory leak because private structures allocated by different threads are not released. The race condition (CWE-362) is the root cause, and the memory leak (CWE-401) is a direct consequence.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis identifies a race condition (CWE-362) as the primary cause of a memory leak (CWE-401) in the Linux kernel when handling concurrent `lseek` system calls. The **race condition** occurs because multiple threads access `file->private_data` without proper synchronization, leading to a **memory leak** when one thread overwrites the private data structure allocated by another thread.\n\nThe evidence from the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" and \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" directly supports this classification. The root cause is explicitly mentioned as a \"race condition\", and the weakness is described as a \"memory leak\". The provided content also details the steps leading to the memory leak.\n\nCWE-362 is chosen as the primary CWE because it represents the fundamental flaw that triggers the vulnerability. CWE-401 is a secondary CWE that describes the resulting memory leak. The selection of these CWEs is based on the evidence provided and the official MITRE mapping guidance.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
