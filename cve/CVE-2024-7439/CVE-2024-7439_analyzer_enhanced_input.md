## Vulnerability Description
** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** A vulnerability was found in Vivotek CC8160 VVTK-0100d and classified as critical. Affected by this issue is the function read of the component httpd. The manipulation of the argument Content-Length leads to **stack-based buffer overflow**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-273524. NOTE This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. NOTE Vendor was contacted early and confirmed that the affected release tree is end-of-life.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack-based buffer overflow**
- **vector:** manipulation of Content-Length argument
- **product:** Vivotek CC8160
- **version:** VVTK-0100d
- **component:** httpd

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content describes a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the VIVOTEK CC8160 VVTK-0100d device's httpd service.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how the `httpd` service processes the `Content-Length` field in HTTP requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow.
- Improper handling of the `Content-Length` field, leading to a buffer overflow when the provided length exceeds the allocated buffer size.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- This vulnerability can allow attackers to overwrite the stack and potentially gain control of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable device's `httpd` service.
- The malicious HTTP request includes a `Content-Length` header with a value that exceeds the size of the buffer used to store the incoming data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. This likely means the attacker must be on the same network segment as the device or be able to route traffic to it.

This content provides more details than the official CVE description, including the specific vulnerable field (`Content-Length`) and the affected component (`httpd`).
