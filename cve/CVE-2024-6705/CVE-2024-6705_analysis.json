  "description": "The RegLevel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.1 due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.",

This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:\n    *   Session hijacking\n    *   Malware distribution\n    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites\n    *   Defacement of the website\n    *   Data theft\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   The vulnerability is located in the admin settings of the RegLevel plugin.\n*   An attacker would need to be logged in with administrator-level permissions or above to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   The attacker must have administrative access or higher.\n*   The attacker must be able to modify the plugin settings via the admin interface.\n*   The exploit only works on multi-site installations and on installations where `unfiltered_html` has been disabled.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n*   The vulnerable plugin is RegLevel, versions 1.2.1 and below.\n*   The vulnerability was publicly published on July 17, 2024.\n*   There is no patch available for this vulnerability. The recommendation is to uninstall the plugin.\n*   The vulnerability is located in the `includes/admin.php` and `includes/functions.php` files as referenced by the provided trac links.",
