The secondary CWE is CWE-668 (Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere), which is at the Class level.\nCWE-1021 is related to CWE-668 in that the improper restriction could lead to exposing the screen stack to the wrong sphere.

The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" indicates that the root cause is the improper handling of screen stacks across different processes.\n\nThe choice of CWE-1021 is supported by the \"Retriever Results\" which lists it with a high score due to the dense analysis. Other CWEs like CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read), CWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value), and CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) were considered but deemed less relevant as they don't directly address the UI layer restriction issue.\n\nThe evidence supporting CWE-1021 is as follows:\n- \"Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is a cross-process screen stack issue within the UIExtension module.\"\n- \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper handling of screen stacks across different processes.\"\n\nThese statements clearly indicate that the core issue is related to cross-process handling of screen stacks, which aligns with the description of CWE-1021.\n\nCWE-1021 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
