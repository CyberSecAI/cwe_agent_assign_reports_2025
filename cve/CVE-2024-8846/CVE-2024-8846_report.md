# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-8846

## Description

PDF-XChange Editor TIF File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of TIF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24835.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis

The primary weakness is **CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read**, which is a base-level CWE. The **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (**CWE-20 Improper Input Validation**) is a contributing factor, making it a secondary weakness. The **information disclosure** aspect is captured by **CWE-497 Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere**, indicating the impact of the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-20 Improper Input Validation**, where the application **lacks proper validation of user-supplied data**. This leads to **CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read** because the application reads past the end of an allocated object when parsing TIF files. The final impact is **CWE-497 Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere** due to the **information disclosure vulnerability**. The attacker can then potentially **execute arbitrary code** by leveraging this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities.

## Summary of Analysis

The initial assessment correctly identified **CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read** as a primary weakness. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions an **Out-Of-Bounds Read** issue within the parsing of TIF files, resulting from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, leading to a read past the end of an allocated object.

The **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** directly corresponds to **CWE-20 Improper Input Validation**. Since the vulnerability leads to **information disclosure**, **CWE-497 Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere** is included as a secondary weakness to capture this aspect.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. **CWE-125** is a Base-level CWE that precisely describes the **Out-of-bounds Read** issue. **CWE-20** is a Class-level CWE that describes **Improper Input Validation**, which is the root cause. **CWE-497** is a Base-level CWE that captures the **information disclosure** impact.

**CWEs Considered But Not Used:**

*   **CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write**: While the vulnerability description mentions the possibility of arbitrary code execution if this vulnerability is chained with another, the primary issue is an **Out-of-bounds Read**, not a write.
*   **CWE-1284 Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input**: This is too specific. The vulnerability description doesn't focus on a specific quantity but rather on a general **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**.
*   **CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow**: There's no explicit mention of a heap overflow, so this is less appropriate than **CWE-125**.
