## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the segment routing feature for the Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to **insufficient input validation** of ingress IS-IS packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific IS-IS packets to an affected device after forming an adjacency. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the IS-IS process on all affected devices that are participating in the Flexible Algorithm to crash and restart, resulting in a DoS condition. Note The IS-IS protocol is a routing protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be Layer 2-adjacent to the affected device and must have formed an adjacency. This vulnerability affects segment routing for IS-IS over IPv4 and IPv6 control planes as well as devices that are configured as level 1, level 2, or multi-level routing IS-IS type.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient input validation**
- **impact:** crash and restart and denial of service (DoS)
- **vector:** specific IS-IS packets
- **attacker:** unauthenticated adjacent attacker
- **product:** Cisco IOS XR Software
- **component:** segment routing feature for the Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation of ingress IS-IS packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of IS-IS packets within the segment routing feature for the IS-IS protocol in Cisco IOS XR Software. This insufficient validation allows an attacker to send specially crafted IS-IS packets that can trigger a crash of the IS-IS process.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition, causing the IS-IS process on affected devices participating in the Flexible Algorithm to crash and restart.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves sending specific, crafted IS-IS packets to a vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be Layer 2-adjacent to the affected device and must have successfully formed an adjacency with it. The attacker does not need authentication to exploit the vulnerability, however, configuring IS-IS area authentication is recommended as a mitigation to slow down attackers.
