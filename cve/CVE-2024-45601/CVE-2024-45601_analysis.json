  "description": "Mesop is a Python-based UI framework designed for rapid web apps development. A vulnerability has been discovered and fixed in Mesop that could potentially allow unauthorized access to files on the server hosting the Mesop application. The vulnerability was related to **insufficient input validation** in a specific endpoint. This could have allowed an attacker to access files not intended to be served. Users are strongly advised to update to the latest version of Mesop immediately. The latest version includes a fix for this vulnerability. At time of publication 0.12.4 is the most recently available version of Mesop.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- Insufficient input validation in the static file serving endpoint of the Mesop application. This allowed an attacker to potentially bypass intended restrictions and access files outside of the intended scope.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation on the file paths provided to the static file server. This could allow an attacker to request files located outside of the designated web component directory, leading to local file inclusion.\n- **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The application did not properly sanitize or validate the input file path, which is a common cause for path traversal vulnerabilities.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unauthorized File Access:** An attacker could read any file on the server hosting the Mesop application that the server process has permission to access. This could include sensitive configuration files, source code, or other confidential data, depending on the server's environment and permissions.\n- **Confidentiality Breach:** Exploitation could lead to the disclosure of confidential information, which could have serious consequences for the security of the application and its users.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network, meaning a remote attacker can send malicious requests to the vulnerable endpoint.\n- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker would manipulate the file path in the URL to include traversal sequences (e.g. `../`) to navigate to unintended directories and files.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker only needs network connectivity to reach the Mesop server.\n- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without requiring any authentication, as indicated by \"Privileges required: None\" in the CVSS vector.\n- **No User Interaction Required:** The attack can be carried out without requiring any action from the server's users, as indicated by \"User interaction: None\" in the CVSS vector.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- The fix involved restricting the accepted file extensions to only `.js` and `.css` files in the `static_file_serving.py` file.\n- The vulnerability was reported by Letm3through.\n- The vulnerability is present in Mesop versions prior to 0.12.4 and from 0.9.0 onwards.\n- The vulnerability has a high severity rating of 7.5, due to the potential for a full confidentiality breach.\n- This is referenced by CVE-2024-45601\n\n**Summary:**\nThe vulnerability allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to read arbitrary files on the server by exploiting insufficient validation in the static file serving component. This is a severe issue that can have significant security implications.",
