## Vulnerability Description
In https//github.com/google/nftables IP addresses were encoded in the wrong byte order, resulting in an nftables configuration which does not work as intended (might block or not block the desired addresses). This issue affects https//pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/nftables@v0.1.0 The bug was fixed in the next released version https//pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/nftables@v0.2.0

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **IP addresses encoded in wrong byte order**
- **impact:** nftables configuration does not work as intended
- **product:** github.com/google/nftables
- **version:** v0.1.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6284:

**1. Verification of CVE relation:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2024-6284. The launchpad bug report mentions the CVE ID, and the linked GitHub issues confirm that the root cause is a byte order issue within the `google/nftables` library. This issue leads to incorrect IP addresses being blocked by `crowdsec-firewall-bouncer` on little-endian systems, which is a vulnerability.

**2. Root cause of the vulnerability:**

The root cause is an endianness bug in the `google/nftables` Go library. When adding IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to nftables sets, the library incorrectly reverses the byte order on little-endian systems. This is due to the library not properly handling the conversion between the host's byte order and the byte order expected by nftables.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Incorrect IP Address Blocking:** The `crowdsec-firewall-bouncer` uses the `google/nftables` library to add IP addresses to nftables for blocking. Due to the byte order reversal, the bouncer blocks the wrong IP addresses. This means that malicious IPs might not be blocked and legitimate IPs could be blocked instead.
- **False Sense of Security:** The incorrect blocking behavior can lead to a false sense of security, as the bouncer appears to be working but is actually not blocking the intended traffic.
- **Bypass:** By exploiting the reversed byte order, an attacker could potentially bypass the firewall by sending traffic from IP addresses that would be misinterpreted.
- **Confusion:** The mismatch between IPs in logs and nftables rules makes it difficult to troubleshoot and verify the system's security posture.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

- **Incorrect Blocking:** Legitimate traffic might be blocked, causing denial of service for valid users.
- **Security Bypass:** Malicious IPs may not be blocked, allowing attackers to continue their attacks.
- **Operational Issues:** Difficulty in troubleshooting due to the mismatch in IPs and potential for other operational disruptions.

**5. Attack vectors:**

-  The vulnerability is triggered by the firewall bouncer when it interacts with the `google/nftables` library while adding IP addresses to nftables sets.
-  An attacker does not directly trigger the vulnerability but benefits from the incorrect behavior of the firewall.
-  The vulnerability exists on little-endian systems when the `crowdsec-firewall-bouncer` is used.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker does not directly exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker only needs to engage in behavior that `crowdsec` flags as malicious.
-  The attacker benefits indirectly from the vulnerability, as the wrong IP addresses are being blocked, allowing them to continue their attacks.
-  The vulnerability affects all users of `crowdsec-firewall-bouncer` on little-endian systems using the vulnerable version of `google/nftables`

**Additional details from the content:**

- The issue was initially reported against the `crowdsec-firewall-bouncer` due to the incorrect blocking behavior.
- The fix was identified in the `google/nftables` library and was backported to Debian.
- The fix involves correctly handling byte order when adding IP addresses to nftables sets on little-endian systems.
- Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are affected.
- The vulnerability was resolved by rebuilding the `crowdsec-firewall-bouncer` against a fixed version of the `google/nftables` library.
- The `google/nftables` issue was fixed with commit `d746ecb0e494e7200180c3886fde9664d9100729`.
