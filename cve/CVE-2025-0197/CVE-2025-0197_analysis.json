This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file /user/search.php. The manipulation of the argument name leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-0197 (although the description is a placeholder, the content relates to a vulnerability)\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n* The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `search.php` file of a PHP-based POS (Point of Sale) inventory system. The `$search` parameter from the HTTP request is directly incorporated into an SQL query without sanitization or parameterization.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n* **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization. User-supplied input via the `name` parameter in the POST request is directly used to construct the SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n* **Data Breach:** A successful SQL injection could allow an attacker to bypass authentication, read sensitive data from the database (potentially including user credentials, sales data, product information, etc.), modify or delete data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n* **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/user/search.php` endpoint. The malicious SQL payload is injected into the `name` parameter of the request.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n* **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable application, specifically the `/user/search.php` endpoint.\n* **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft an HTTP POST request and understand how to inject malicious SQL code into the `name` parameter.\n* **Application Knowledge:** While not strictly necessary to exploit, knowledge of the underlying database structure could allow for more targeted attacks.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n\nThe vulnerable code is located within the `search.php` file. The code directly takes the user-supplied `name` parameter (`$search`) and uses it in a SQL query.  The provided PoC demonstrates how a simple POST request with a crafted `name` parameter can be used to trigger the vulnerability. The `name=1&ss=1` payload in the PoC indicates that the `name` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.\n\n```\nPOST /POS_inventory/user/search.php HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost\n...\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8\n...\n\nname=1&ss=1\n```\n\nThe provided images further show that the `search.php` file does not sanitize the user-provided `name` parameter, leading to the SQL injection vulnerability.",
