## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved netfilter flowtable initialise extack before use Fix **missing initialisation** of extack in flow offload.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **missing initialisation**
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** netfilter flowtable initialise extack before use

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, this commit addresses a bug in the Linux kernel's netfilter flowtable module related to hardware offloading.

**Root cause of vulnerability**:
The vulnerability stems from a missing initialization of the `extack` structure within the `nf_flow_offload_tuple` function in `net/netfilter/nf_flow_table_offload.c`. This structure is used for extended error reporting in netlink communications.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
- Uninitialized `extack` variable: The code declares `struct netlink_ext_ack extack;` without initializing it, which can lead to undefined behavior when `extack` is used.

**Impact of exploitation**:
- The primary impact is a potential for incorrect error reporting or other undefined behavior during the flow offload process.
- This issue could cause unexpected behavior or errors when using netfilter hardware offload.

**Attack vectors**:
- An attacker cannot directly exploit this vulnerability.
- The bug is triggered when hardware offloading is used by the netfilter flowtable module.

**Required attacker capabilities/position**:
- The attacker would need to have control over the network configuration or traffic to be able to trigger the code path that would use hardware offloading and encounter the missing initialization.
- This is not an issue exploitable from outside the system; the attacker would likely require root or administrative access to influence networking.

The fix involves initializing the `extack` structure with `{}` during its declaration:

```diff

        struct flow_cls_offload cls_flow = {};
+       struct netlink_ext_ack extack = {};
        struct flow_block_cb *block_cb;
-       struct netlink_ext_ack extack;
        __be16 proto = ETH_P_ALL;
        int err, i = 0;
```
This change ensures that the `extack` structure has a defined state before use, preventing the undefined behavior caused by the uninitialized variable.
