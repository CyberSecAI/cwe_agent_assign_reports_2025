  "query": "The WordPress Simple Shopping Cart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to product price manipulation in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.2. This is due to a logic flaw involving the inconsistent use of parameters during the cart addition process. The plugin uses the parameter product_tmp_two for computing a security hash against price tampering while using wspsc_product to display the product, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to substitute details from a cheaper product and bypass payment for a more expensive item. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-91 CWE-863 CWE-862 CWE-306 CWE-472 CWE-352 CWE-285 CWE-96 CWE-425",
