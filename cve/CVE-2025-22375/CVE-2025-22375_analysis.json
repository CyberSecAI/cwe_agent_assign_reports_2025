  "description": "An authentication bypass vulnerability was found in Videxs CyberAudit-Web. Through the exploitation of a **logic flaw**, an attacker could create a valid session without any credentials. This vulnerability has been patched in versions later than 9.5 and a patch has been made available to all instances of CyberAudit-Web, including the versions that are End of Maintenance (EOM). Anyone that requires support with the resolution of this issue can contact support@videx.com for assistance.",

CWE-288 is a more specific case of improper authentication, where an alternate path or channel bypasses the authentication process. The relationship between CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was considered since the vulnerability allows the creation of a valid session without credentials, however, the description points more directly to an authentication bypass.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe288 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe288 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe863 secondary\n    class cwe287,cwe285 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **logic flaw**, which leads to an authentication bypass, allowing an attacker to create a valid session without credentials.\n\nLogic Flaw -> Authentication Bypass (CWE-288) -> Unauthorized Session Creation\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that a **logic flaw** allows an attacker to create a valid session without any credentials. This points towards an authentication bypass. The retriever results suggest CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), and CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) as potential candidates.\n\nGiven the provided guidance, CWE-306 would be considered if there was completely missing authentication. However, the phrase \"**logic flaw**\" and \"create a valid session\" suggests that there is an attempt at authentication but it is being bypassed. This is better captured by CWE-288, Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel.\nCWE-863 is about incorrect authorization, which is relevant if the user could log in, but then access restricted resources. Since the vulnerability is about creating a session without credentials, it is an authentication issue.\n\nThe description specifies a \"**logic flaw**\" that permits bypassing authentication, making CWE-288 the most accurate representation of the **root cause**. The fact that the attacker can create a valid session supports this classification.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n**CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel**\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication. This is the primary CWE because it directly addresses the ability to bypass authentication through a **logic flaw**.\n\n**CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function**\nThe product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources. This is a secondary CWE. While the vulnerability allows creating a session without credentials, it is not due to a complete lack of authentication, but rather a bypass.\n\n**CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization**\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check. This is a secondary CWE. Since the vulnerability allows the creation of a valid session without credentials, it is primarily an authentication issue, not an authorization issue.",
