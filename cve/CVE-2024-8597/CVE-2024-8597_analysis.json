It is more specific than its parent CWE, CWE-119 **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer**, which is a Class level CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"Memory Corruption\" due to parsing a maliciously crafted file, which directly aligns with the concept of writing data outside the intended buffer.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a maliciously crafted STEP file. When this file is parsed by ASMDATAX230A.dll in Autodesk AutoCAD, it triggers an **Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)**, leading to **Memory Corruption**. This memory corruption can then result in a crash, the writing of sensitive data, or the execution of arbitrary code.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary selection of CWE-787 is strongly supported by the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The description explicitly mentions \"**Memory Corruption**\" caused by parsing a maliciously crafted STEP file, and the content summary states \"A memory corruption vulnerability exists when parsing a maliciously crafted STEP file within the ASMDATAX230A.dll.\" The retriever results also list CWE-787 as the top candidate with a high score.\n\nCWE-119 was considered because CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119. However, CWE-787 is more specific and accurately describes the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reads or writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: The CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries might be available.
