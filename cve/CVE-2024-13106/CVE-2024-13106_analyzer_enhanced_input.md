## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in D-Link DIR-816 A2 1.10CNB05_R1B011D88210 and classified as critical. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /goform/form2IPQoSTcAdd of the component IP QoS Handler. The manipulation leads to **improper access controls**. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper access controls**
- **product:** D-Link DIR-816 A2
- **version:** 1.10CNB05_R1B011D88210
- **component:** /goform/form2IPQoSTcAdd of IP QoS Handler

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an improper access control vulnerability in the web management interface of the D-Link DIR-816A2 router.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Access Control:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `goform` endpoint, specifically when used with the `form2IPQoSTcAdd` header, does not require authentication to modify QoS settings. This allows unauthorized users to access and change settings on the router.
- **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability is specifically triggered by sending an unauthenticated HTTP POST request, meaning an attacker does not need to log into the device to exploit it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Manipulation of QoS Settings:** An attacker can modify the Quality of Service (QoS) settings of the router. This could lead to a denial-of-service by prioritizing or deprioritizing network traffic for specific devices or applications, disrupting normal network operations.
- **Potential Network Disruption:** By manipulating QoS settings, an attacker could degrade network performance, potentially making it difficult or impossible for users to access the internet or specific network services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is sending an unauthenticated HTTP POST request to the `/goform` endpoint with the header set to `form2IPQoSTcAdd`.
- **Network Access:** An attacker would need network access to the D-Link router, either through the local network or if the web management interface is exposed to the internet, remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router's web interface.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication on the router.
- The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable device.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is confirmed to be present in D-Link DIR-816A2 with firmware version `v1.10`.
- The provided POC images demonstrate the network request and a successful QoS setting change using the described method.
