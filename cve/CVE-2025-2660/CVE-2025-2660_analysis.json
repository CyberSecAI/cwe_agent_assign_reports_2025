  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-2660 Content\n\nThis content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it does not directly reference CVE-2025-2660. It details a SQL injection vulnerability in \"projectworlds Online Time Table Generator Portal-Source code\".  It provides more detail than a typical CVE description.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the 'e' parameter in `/admin/index.php`.  The parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering\n*   Comprehensive system control\n*   Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The `/admin/index.php` file is vulnerable.\n*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.\n*   The 'e' parameter is the injection point.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP POST requests to `/admin/index.php` with a malicious payload in the 'e' parameter. No authentication is required.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Use prepared statements and parameter binding.\n*   Input validation and filtering.\n*   Minimize database user permissions.\n*   Regular security audits.\n\n**Payload Example:**\n\n```\n---\nParameter: e (POST)\n    Type: time-based blind\n    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)\n    Payload: e=123456' AND (SELECT 3912 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))qHBy) AND 'tbBp'='tbBp&p=123456&save=Login\n---\n```\n\n**Software Link:**\n\n*   <https://projectworlds.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/timetable.zip>\n\n**Affected Version:**\n\n*   Current release (as of 2025-03-14)\n\n**Fixed Version:**\n\n*   Not patched as of vulnerability disclosure.",

The other CWEs listed were considered but ultimately not selected because they did not directly address the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the lack of proper input sanitization leading to SQL injection. There are no relevant parent-child or chain relationships to consider in this case.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization** of user-supplied input, specifically the 'e' parameter, which is then used in an SQL query. This leads directly to the impact, which is SQL injection and the ability to manipulate the database.\n\nImproper Input Neutralization (CWE-89) -> SQL Injection\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe assessment is based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly states that the manipulation of the argument 'e' leads to **SQL injection**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this, stating that the vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the 'e' parameter. The description and the summary provide direct evidence to support the selection of CWE-89, **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')**, as the primary CWE.\n\nThe retriever results also support this selection, with CWE-89 having the highest score. The fact that the **'e' parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation** is a clear indicator of this weakness.\n\nThe selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly describes the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **improper neutralization** of special elements in an SQL command.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
