# Vulnerability Description

    **Integer overflow** in libaom internal function img_alloc_helper can lead to **heap buffer overflow**. This function can be reached via 3 callers * Calling aom_img_alloc() with a large value of the d_w, d_h, or align parameter may result in **integer overflow**s in the calculations of buffer sizes and offsets and some fields of the returned aom_image_t struct may be invalid. * Calling aom_img_wrap() with a large value of the d_w, d_h, or align parameter may result in **integer overflow**s in the calculations of buffer sizes and offsets and some fields of the returned aom_image_t struct may be invalid. * Calling aom_img_alloc_with_border() with a large value of the d_w, d_h, align, size_align, or border parameter may result in **integer overflow**s in the calculations of buffer sizes and offsets and some fields of the returned aom_image_t struct may be invalid.

    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. 
    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.

    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'integer overflow'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 972.91)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...

### 2. CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input (Score: 924.60)

The product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties....

The product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties....

### 4. CWE-195: Signed to Unsigned Conversion Error (Score: 887.75)

The product uses a signed primitive and performs a cast to an unsigned primitive, which can produce an unexpected value if the value of the signed primitive can not be represented using an unsigned primitive....

### 5. CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound) (Score: 884.52)

The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result....
