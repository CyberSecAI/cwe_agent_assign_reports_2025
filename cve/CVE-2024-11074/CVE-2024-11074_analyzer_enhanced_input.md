## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability classified as critical was found in itsourcecode Tailoring Management System 1.0. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file /incadd.php. The manipulation of the argument inccat/desc/date/amount leads to **sql injection**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The initial researcher advisory only mentions the parameter inccat to be affected. But it must be assumed desc, date, and amount are affected as well.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** itsourcecode Tailoring Management System
- **version:** 1
- **component:** /incadd.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content relates to CVE-2024-11074.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `incadd.php` file of the "Tailoring Management System Project In PHP With Source Code".
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user input, specifically the `inccat` parameter, before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly incorporates user-supplied data into SQL queries without proper sanitization.
- Lack of input validation: The application fails to validate and filter user-provided data, making it susceptible to injection attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access
- Sensitive data leakage
- Data tampering
- Comprehensive system control
- Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to the `incadd.php` file
- Maliciously crafted SQL injection payload in the `inccat` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the server.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter (`inccat`) and how to construct SQL injection payloads.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is classified as a time-based blind SQL injection.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection using a `SLEEP()` function.
- The attacker can use SQLMap to automate the exploitation process.
- The vulnerability is located in the 'inccat' parameter of the `incadd.php` file.
- The vulnerable software is "Tailoring Management System Project In PHP With Source Code" version 1.0.
- The vulnerable file is `incadd.php`.
- Suggested repair includes using prepared statements, input validation, minimizing database user permissions, and regular security audits.
