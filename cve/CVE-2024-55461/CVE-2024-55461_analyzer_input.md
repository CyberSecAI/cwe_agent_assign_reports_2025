# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-55461

## Vulnerability Description
SeaCMS <=13.0 is vulnerable to command execution in phome.php via the function Ebak_RepPathFiletext().

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** command execution
- **product:** SeaCMS
- **version:** <=13.0
- **component:** phome.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `Ebak_RepPathFiletext` function within the `phome.php` file of the Seacms backend. This function is designed to replace text within files located in a backup directory. However, it inadequately sanitizes user-provided input, specifically the `mypath`, `oldword` and `newword` parameters.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Path Traversal (Limited):** Although there's a check for `..` in `$mypath`, the `$bakpath` is hardcoded and allows an attacker to control the `$path` variable by controlling the `mypath` parameter. This limits the path traversal to the subdirectories of `$bakpath`.
    *   **Unrestricted File Modification:** The core issue is that the function reads and replaces content in files within the user-controlled path (under `$bakpath`). The function `WriteFiletext_n` is used to write the modified content to the file, and the `$newvalue` that is written to the file is mostly controlled by the attacker with limited filtering.
    *  **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `Ebak_ClearAddsData` function is applied to the `oldword` and `newword` parameters which appear to be insufficient to prevent the injection of malicious code.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can modify the contents of arbitrary files within the backup directory of the application. This can include configuration files such as `config.php`. By injecting malicious code into these files, an attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.  The provided example shows that the attacker was able to inject `phpinfo()` into the config.php file.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    1.  **Database Backup:** The attacker first needs to use the backup functionality in the application to create a backup folder and files within the `$bakpath` directory.
    2.  **Crafted HTTP Request:** The attacker crafts a POST request to `/z5fskt/ebak/phome.php?phome=RepPathFiletext` providing values for `mypath`, `oldword`, and `newword` parameters.
        *   `mypath`: Specifies a subdirectory within the backup directory
        *   `oldword`: Specifies a string that will be replaced in the targeted files. This is usually a string present in the database backup
        *   `newword`: Specifies the replacement string, typically malicious code such as `phpinfo()`.
        *   `dozz`: This parameter controls the type of text replacement operation used, by setting it to 1 the regex replacement function is used, otherwise `str_replace` is used.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have access to the administrative backend of the application to be able to make backups and modify files in the `/ebak/` directory.
    *   The attacker needs to know or be able to determine the backup path (`$bakpath`) which is hardcoded.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to successfully make database backups to create files to be modified.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft and send the malicious HTTP requests.

**Summary:**

The provided content describes a critical vulnerability in Seacms that allows authenticated attackers with backend access to achieve remote code execution via modifying backup files. This is achieved by manipulating the `mypath`, `oldword` and `newword` parameters when calling the `Ebak_RepPathFiletext` function. The vulnerability is similar in concept to CVE-2024-40522, but exists in different functions and files of the application.
