CWE-119 is a class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-120, representing a broader category. CWE-120 is a more specific case of CWE-119, involving buffer copies without checking size, leading to overflows. The relationship between CWE-120 and CWE-119 influenced the selection, prioritizing the more specific CWE-120.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe120 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **buffer overflow** due to copying data into a buffer without checking the input size. This **weakness** leads to a potential crash or arbitrary code execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified **buffer overflow** as the main **weakness**, pointing towards CWE-120. The retriever results also listed CWE-120 as a candidate. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**buffer overflow**\" as the **weakness**, confirming the relevance of CWE-120. The selection of CWE-120 is based on the evidence of a buffer copy operation without input size validation, leading to a buffer overflow. CWE-120 is at the optimal level of specificity (Base).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this

overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation.
