# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-6153

# Vulnerability Description

    Parallels Desktop Updater **Protection Mechanism Failure** Software Downgrade Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to downgrade Parallels software on affected installations of Parallels Desktop. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target host system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the Updater service. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of version information before performing an update**. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-19481.
