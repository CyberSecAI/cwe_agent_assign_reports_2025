There are child CWEs of CWE-89 like CWE-564 (because a malformed SQL command could expose sensitive data). The abstraction level is Base, which is appropriate for root cause analysis.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe564[\"CWE-564: SQL Injection: Hibernate\"]\n\n    cwe564 -->|CHILDOF| cwe89\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe564 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**, leading to **time-based SQL Injection**, which allows attackers to **extract sensitive information from the database and append additional SQL queries**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided vulnerability description and key phrases. The description clearly states that the vulnerability is due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**, which results in a **time-based SQL Injection** vulnerability. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-89, \"Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\". The retriever results also list CWE-89 as the top candidate.\n\nThe relationship graph shows that CWE-89 has child CWEs that could be more specific, but the provided evidence doesn't point to those specific cases. Therefore, CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity based on the current evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
