  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-4253', description='A **command injection** vulnerability exists in the gradio-app/gradio repository, specifically within the test-functional.yml workflow. The vulnerability arises due to **improper neutralization of special elements** used in a command, allowing for unauthorized modification of the base repository or secrets exfiltration. The issue affects versions up to and including @gradio/video@0.6.12. The flaw is present in the workflows handling of GitHub context information, where it echoes the full name of the head repository, the head branch, and the workflow reference without adequate sanitization. This could potentially lead to the exfiltration of sensitive secrets such as GITHUB_TOKEN, COMMENT_TOKEN, and CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN.', key_phrases={'rootcause': ['improper input sanitization', 'improper neutralization of special elements'], 'weakness': 'command injection', 'impact': 'unauthorized modification of the base repository or secrets exfiltration', 'vector': '', 'attacker': '', 'product': '@gradio/video', 'version': 'up to and including 0.6.12', 'component': 'test-functional.yml workflow'}, reference_content='The provided content includes a commit message and diff from a GitHub repository related to a fix for \"vulnerability code injection\" in the `test-functional.yml` file.  However, this content alone doesn\\'t provide enough information to definitively connect it to CVE-2024-4253.\\nBased on the provided content, here\\'s what can be extracted:\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\n\\n*  The commit message mentions \"Fix vulnerability code injection\" within the context of a GitHub Actions workflow file (`test-functional.yml`). It suggests that the previous version of this file was vulnerable to code injection, but the exact mechanism is not explicitly stated in the content.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n\\n* The vulnerability is a code injection flaw within the workflow file, which is likely an environment variable injection vulnerability within the echo command\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n\\n* The impact is not clearly defined in the provided text. However, code injection vulnerabilities can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands within the context of the GitHub Actions runner, leading to various malicious outcomes such as data exfiltration, supply chain attacks, or denial of service.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n\\n* The attack vector is related to the `github.event.workflow_run` context available in github actions. A crafted value in the associated properties would inject malicious code when echoed to the console.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n\\n* The attacker would need to have some control over the values of the properties accessed within the `github.event.workflow_run` context. This could potentially occur by manipulating the parameters used to trigger the workflow run.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n* The commit diff shows the removal of the line containing the echo command and associated properties and suggests that the vulnerability was fixed by removing the potentially vulnerable code.\\n* The provided text references pull request [#8145](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/8145). This pull request may contain more details, but the current content only provides the commit message and a diff of the modified file.\\n\\nBecause the provided information lacks specific details about the root cause of the vulnerability, and the CVE description itself is a placeholder, it\\'s difficult to definitively confirm that the issue addressed here is the same as CVE-2024-4253.',

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    A **command injection** vulnerability exists in the gradio-app/gradio repository, specifically within the test-functional.yml workflow. The vulnerability arises due to **improper neutralization of special elements** used in a command, allowing for unauthorized modification of the base repository or secrets exfiltration. The issue affects versions up to and including @gradio/video@0.6.12. The flaw is present in the workflows handling of GitHub context information, where it echoes the full name of the head repository, the head branch, and the workflow reference without adequate sanitization. This could potentially lead to the exfiltration of sensitive secrets such as GITHUB_TOKEN, COMMENT_TOKEN, and CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'improper input sanitization'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
