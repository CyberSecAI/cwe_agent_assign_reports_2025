The specific impact varies case by case.\\n*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious actor crafts a request that is then executed by a logged-in user, without their knowledge or consent.\\n*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into clicking a link or loading a webpage that contains the malicious request. This does not require any privilege on the target system, only that a user be logged in to the affected system.\\n\\n**Additional Information:**\\n\\n*   The vulnerability is classified as having a low priority.\\n*   A virtual patch has been issued by Patchstack to mitigate the issue until an official fix is available.\\n*   The vulnerability was reported by SOPROBRO on 10 Oct 2024.\\n*   The vulnerability is classified under OWASP Top 10 as A1: Broken Access Control.\\n* The CVSS score is 7.1, although noted that this may not be ideal for CMSs\\n* The required privilege to exploit this is 'Unauthenticated' meaning that it does not require any privilege on the target system, only that a user be logged in to the affected system.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:Lars Schenk Responsive Flickr Gallery', 'keyphrase': 'Lars Schenk Responsive Flickr Gallery', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 1.3.1', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 1.3.1', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(289.20393539574)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '434', 'name': 'Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 1.3.1', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 1.3.1', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(200.88116517071632)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
