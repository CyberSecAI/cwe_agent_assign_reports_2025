This is classified as an \"A9: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures\" according to OWASP Top 10.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- A malicious actor can view sensitive information that is not normally available to regular users.\n- This exposed information can be further leveraged to exploit other weaknesses in the system.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users, implying that no prior access to the system is required.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker requires no authentication to exploit this vulnerability. They can be external users without any prior access to the system.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The vulnerability is considered a low priority issue with a CVSS score of 5.3.\n- The vulnerability is present in versions of the MBE eShip plugin for WordPress <= 2.1.2\n- The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.2.1",

CWE-200, a class-level CWE, describes the resulting **exposure of sensitive information**. While CWE-200 is a potential consequence, CWE-269 better captures the root cause of the flaw where **functionality is not properly constrained by ACLs**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|RESULT| cwe269\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe269 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper privilege management** (CWE-269), leading to the **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200) as a result.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered CWE-200 due to the **exposure of sensitive information**, but further analysis revealed that the root cause is more accurately described by CWE-269 (**Improper Privilege Management**), which describes the **weakness** where **Functionality is Not Properly Constrained by ACLs**. The retriever results listed CWE-200 as the top result, but its usage is discouraged as it represents the impact rather than the root cause. CWE-269 is not present in the retriever results, but based on the vulnerability description, it is a better fit. The relationships between the CWEs highlight that CWE-200 is a consequence of CWE-269. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-269 at the Base level and CWE-200 at the Class level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
