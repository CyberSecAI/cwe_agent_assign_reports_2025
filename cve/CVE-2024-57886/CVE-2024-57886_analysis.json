  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mm/damon/core fix new damon_target objects leaks on damon_commit_targets() Patch series mm/damon/core fix **memory leaks** and ignored inputs from damon_commit_ctx(). Due to two **bugs in damon_commit_targets() and damon_commit_schemes()**, which are called from damon_commit_ctx(), some user inputs can be ignored, and some mmeory objects can be leaked. Fix those. Note that only DAMON sysfs interface users are affected. Other DAMON core API user modules that more focused more on simple and dedicated production usages, including DAMON_RECLAIM and DAMON_LRU_SORT are not using the buggy function in the way, so not affected. This patch (of 2) When new DAMON targets are added via damon_commit_targets(), the newly created targets are not deallocated when updating the internal data (damon_commit_target()) is failed. Worse yet, even if the setup is successfully done, the new target is not linked to the context. Hence, the new targets are always leaked regardless of the internal data setup failure. Fix the leaks.",

There are no child CWEs. CWE-401 relates to resource management issues.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe401[\"CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe401 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is:\n1.  **Bugs in `damon_commit_targets()` and `damon_commit_schemes()`** lead to...\n2.  **Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime** (CWE-401) which results in...\n3.  Memory objects being leaked.\n\nCWE-401 is the root cause, directly leading to the memory leak impact.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness described is a **memory leak** due to **bugs in `damon_commit_targets()` and `damon_commit_schemes()`**. The vulnerability description clearly states that the newly created targets are not deallocated, leading to the leak. This directly aligns with CWE-401, Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime. The retriever results also list CWE-401 as the top candidate.\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the phrases \"memory leaks\", \"bugs in damon_commit_targets() and damon_commit_schemes()\", and the description of how the targets are not deallocated. This indicates a failure to release memory, which is the core characteristic of CWE-401.\n\nThe relationship analysis shows CWE-401 as a variant, which is a desirable level of specificity.\n\nI considered other CWEs like CWE-909 (Missing Initialization of Resource) and CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource), but these do not accurately describe the vulnerability. The issue isn't about uninitialized resources, but about resources that are allocated but not released after their lifetime.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
