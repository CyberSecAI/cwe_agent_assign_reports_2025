# Retrieval Query for CVE-2025-37792

# Vulnerability Description

    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved Bluetooth btrtl Prevent potential **NULL dereference** The btrtl_initialize() function checks that rtl_load_file() either had an error or it loaded a zero length file. However, if it loaded a zero length file then the error code is not set correctly. It results in an **error pointer vs NULL bug**, followed by a **NULL pointer dereference**. This was detected by Smatch drivers/bluetooth/btrtl.c592 btrtl_initialize() warn passing zero to ERR_PTR

    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis
    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. 
    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.

    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'error pointer vs NULL bug'

Relevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:

### 1. CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference (Score: 531.00)

The product dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid but is NULL....

### 2. CWE-194: Unexpected Sign Extension (Score: 477.29)

The product performs an operation on a number that causes it to be sign extended when it is transformed into a larger data type. When the original number is negative, this can produce unexpected values that lead to resultant weaknesses....

### 3. CWE-833: Deadlock (Score: 467.32)

The product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock....

### 4. CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference (Score: 466.02)

The product obtains a value from an untrusted source, converts this value to a pointer, and dereferences the resulting pointer....

### 5. CWE-665: Improper Initialization (Score: 452.53)

The product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used....
