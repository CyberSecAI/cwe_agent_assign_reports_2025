  "query": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved md fix deadlock between mddev_suspend and flush bio Deadlock occurs when mddev is being suspended while some flush bio is in progress. It is a complex issue. T1. the first flush is at the ending stage, it clears mddev->flush_bio and tries to submit data, but is blocked because mddev is suspended by T4. T2. the second flush sets mddev->flush_bio, and attempts to queue md_submit_flush_data(), which is already running (T1) and wont execute again if on the same CPU as T1. T3. the third flush inc active_io and tries to flush, but is blocked because mddev->flush_bio is not NULL (set by T2). T4. mddev_suspend() is called and waits for active_io dec to 0 which is inc by T3.
