## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability has been identified in the Express response.links function, allowing for arbitrary resource injection in the Link header when unsanitized data is used. The issue arises from **improper sanitization** in `Link` header values, which can allow a combination of characters like `,`, ``, and `<>` to preload malicious resources. This vulnerability is especially relevant for dynamic parameters.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper sanitization**
- **impact:** arbitrary resource injection
- **vector:** combination of characters like ",", ``, and \"<>\"
- **product:** Express
- **component:** response.links function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization within the `response.links` function of the Express framework. This function is used to set the `Link` header in HTTP responses. When unsanitized user-provided data is used as part of the `Link` header values, it allows for resource injection. The lack of sanitization allows attackers to inject characters like `*`, `;`, and `<>` to preload malicious resources. This is particularly problematic when dealing with dynamic parameters.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Resource Injection:** The core vulnerability is a resource injection, as the application uses unsanitized input to construct resource identifiers, leading to unintended resource loading.
    *   **Improper Sanitization:** The failure to sanitize user-provided data before incorporating it into the `Link` header is the direct cause.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not adequately validate and restrict input before using it in the header.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
    *   **Preload Malicious Resources:** By injecting specially crafted URLs into the `Link` header, an attacker can cause a client's browser to preload malicious resources, such as JavaScript files, stylesheets, or other content from attacker-controlled servers.
    *   **Possible Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** While not explicitly stated as a direct XSS vulnerability, the ability to preload resources can potentially lead to XSS if the attacker injects malicious JavaScript.
    *   **Arbitrary Resource Loading:** The attacker gains control over resources loaded by the client, potentially impacting the user experience and compromising security.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP Query Parameters:** The example shows the vulnerability being exploited via manipulating HTTP query parameters, where the `resource` parameter is used to inject the malicious URLs.
    *   **Dynamic Parameters:** The vulnerability is highlighted to be especially relevant in cases where the data is dynamic and user-provided, making it easier to inject malicious payloads.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the capability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application with the malicious payload in the query parameters.
    *   **No Prior Authentication Required:** The provided example doesn't mention any authentication requirements, suggesting that the vulnerability can be exploited without needing to authenticate first.
    *   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Function:** The attacker needs to know the application uses the vulnerable `res.links` function and how to manipulate it.

*   **Affected Versions:** Express versions `3.0.0-alpha1` up to and including `3.21.2` are affected.

*  **Mitigation:**
   * Migrate away from Express 3
   * Use a commercial support partner like HeroDevs for post-EOL security support.

* **Additional Notes:**
    * The vulnerability is in Express version 3 which has reached End-of-Life.
    *  HeroDevs offers a patched version of Express 3 in their "Never-Ending Support" program, which fixes this issue.
    * A proof of concept is provided to demonstrate the vulnerability.
