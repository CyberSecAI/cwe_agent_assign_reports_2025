  "description": "The Backstage Scaffolder plugin Houses types and utilities for building scaffolder-related modules. A vulnerability is identified in Backstage Scaffolder template functionality where Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) can be exploited to perform Git config injection. The vulnerability allows an attacker to capture privileged git tokens used by the Backstage Scaffolder plugin. With these tokens, unauthorized access to sensitive resources in git can be achieved. The impact is considered medium severity as the Backstage Threat Model recommends restricting access to adding and editing templates in the Backstage Catalog plugin. The issue has been resolved in versions `v0.4.12`, `v0.5.1` and `v0.6.1` of the `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-node` package. Users are encouraged to upgrade to this version to mitigate the vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may ensure that templates do not change git config.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-53983:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in the Backstage Scaffolder plugin. This vulnerability allows for Git config injection.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n*   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):**  The core vulnerability lies in the insecure handling of templates, which allows an attacker to inject malicious code.\n*   **Git config injection:** Attackers can inject malicious git configurations via SSTI, potentially capturing privileged tokens.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n*   **Capture of privileged git tokens:** Attackers can gain access to Git tokens used by the Backstage Scaffolder plugin.\n*   **Unauthorized access to sensitive resources:** With compromised git tokens, attackers can access sensitive resources in the Git repository.\n*  **Medium Severity:** Although the potential for damage is high the threat model recommends restricting access to adding and editing templates in the Backstage Catalog plugin.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n*   **Network-based:** The attack is performed over the network.\n*   **Exploiting template functionality:** The attack vector involves exploiting the template functionality of the Backstage Scaffolder plugin.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n*   **High privileges required:** The attacker needs high privileges to add or edit templates within the Backstage Catalog plugin.\n*   **User interaction required:** Some form of user interaction may be needed for the attack to be fully successful, as indicated by the CVSS score.\n*  **Knowledge of Backstage Scaffolder:** The attacker needs an understanding of the Backstage Scaffolder plugin and its template processing mechanism.\n\n**Additional details:**\n*   **Affected versions:** Versions of `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-node` before 0.4.12, 0.5.0, and 0.6.0 are vulnerable.\n*   **Patched versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in versions 0.4.12, 0.5.1, and 0.6.1.\n*   **Workaround:** Ensure templates do not change git config.\n*   **CVSS Score:** 5.4 (Moderate)\n*   **CWE:** CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery) is listed but the core vulnerability is actually SSTI which is then used to create a type of SSRF using git config injection.",

        "extended_description": "\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:\n\n\n  1. Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n\n  1. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data.\n\n  1. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc.\n\n  1. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data.\n\n  1. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain.\n\n  1. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain.\n\nThere are three main kinds of XSS:\n\n  -  **Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent)**  - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.\n\n  -  **Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent)**  - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. \n\n  -  **Type 0: DOM-Based XSS**  - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. \n\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as \"drive-by hacking.\"\n\nIn many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\n",
