# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-4315

# Vulnerability Description

    parisneo/lollms version 9.5 is vulnerable to **Local File Inclusion** (LFI) attacks due to **insufficient path sanitization**. The `sanitize_path_from_endpoint` function fails to properly sanitize Windows-style paths (backward slash `\`), allowing attackers to perform **directory traversal** attacks on Windows systems. This vulnerability can be exploited through various routes, including `personalities` and `/del_preset`, to read or delete any file on the Windows filesystem, compromising the systems availability.
