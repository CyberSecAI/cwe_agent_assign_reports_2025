  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved signal restore the override_rlimit logic Prior to commit d64696905554 (Reimplement RLIMIT_SIGPENDING on top of ucounts) **UCOUNT_RLIMIT_SIGPENDING rlimit was not enforced for a class of signals**. However now its enforced unconditionally, even if override_rlimit is set. This behavior change caused production issues. For example, if the limit is reached and a process receives a SIGSEGV signal, sigqueue_alloc fails to allocate the necessary resources for the signal delivery, preventing the signal from being delivered with siginfo. This prevents the process from correctly identifying the fault address and handling the error. From the user-space perspective, applications are unaware that the limit has been reached and that the siginfo is effectively corrupted. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and crashes, as we observed with java applications. Fix this by passing override_rlimit into inc_rlimit_get_ucounts() and skip the comparison to max there if override_rlimit is set. This effectively restores the old behavior.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n- The root cause lies in a change introduced by commit `d64696905554` which reimplemented `RLIMIT_SIGPENDING` on top of ucounts. This change caused the `UCOUNT_RLIMIT_SIGPENDING` rlimit to be enforced unconditionally, even when `override_rlimit` was set.\n- Prior to this commit, the `UCOUNT_RLIMIT_SIGPENDING` rlimit was not enforced for certain signals when `override_rlimit` was set.\n- The change in behavior caused issues with signal delivery.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n- **Incorrect rlimit enforcement:** The vulnerability is an incorrect enforcement of the `RLIMIT_SIGPENDING` limit when `override_rlimit` is set. This resulted in the limit being checked even when it shouldn't have been.\n- **Signal delivery failure:** When the limit is reached, the kernel fails to allocate resources for signal delivery via `sigqueue_alloc`. This failure means that the signal is delivered without `siginfo` data.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n- **Loss of signal information:** If a process exceeds the `RLIMIT_SIGPENDING`, any subsequent signals (e.g., `SIGSEGV`) would not be able to deliver `siginfo`. This makes it difficult to debug or handle errors properly.\n- **Unpredictable behavior and crashes:** Lack of `siginfo` can lead to unpredictable application behavior and crashes, particularly in cases when the applications rely on `siginfo` data (e.g., to determine the fault address of a segmentation fault). This was observed with Java applications.\n- **User-space unawareness:** Applications are not aware that the limit has been reached and that the `siginfo` is corrupted. This lack of transparency exacerbates debugging difficulties.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n- **Triggering excessive signals:** An attacker could craft an application or an attack scenario that sends a large number of signals to a targeted process, exceeding `RLIMIT_SIGPENDING`. This would lead to the inability to deliver signals with `siginfo`\n- **Resource exhaustion:** Although not explicitly mentioned in this specific document, resource exhaustion via excessive signals could also be a goal for an attacker.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n- **Ability to send signals:** The attacker would need to be able to send signals to the target process. This could be achieved through a malicious application running in the same system, or by exploiting a vulnerability in another process that allows them to send signals.\n- **Trigger a fault signal:** The attacker might need to trigger a fault that results in a `SIGSEGV`, or other signal to cause problems.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The fix involves passing `override_rlimit` into `inc_rlimit_get_ucounts()` and skipping the comparison to `max` there if `override_rlimit` is set, effectively restoring the old behavior.\n- The provided patches (commits) address this by correctly handling the `override_rlimit` flag during signal handling and rlimit checks.\n- The code changes are present in `include/linux/user_namespace.h`, `kernel/signal.c`, and `kernel/ucount.c`.",

While several CWEs related to signal handling and resource allocation were considered, CWE-754, being a Class-level CWE, was chosen to represent the **improper check** for an exceptional condition (reaching the rlimit).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe754[\"CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe364[\"CWE-364: Signal Handler Race Condition\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe754 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe770\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe754 primary\n    class cwe770,cwe364 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **improper check** (CWE-754) for the `UCOUNT_RLIMIT_SIGPENDING` rlimit when `override_rlimit` is set. This leads to an incorrect enforcement of the limit, which in turn causes a failure to allocate resources for signal delivery. The lack of `siginfo` then results in unpredictable application behavior and crashes.\n  - The **root cause** is the **improper check** for the rlimit.\n  - The impact includes signal delivery failure and application crashes.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on signal handler specific CWEs but evolved towards a broader categorization based on the root cause. The key evidence lies in the description stating that the `UCOUNT_RLIMIT_SIGPENDING` rlimit was enforced unconditionally, even if `override_rlimit` was set. This signifies an **improper check** for an exceptional condition.\n\nThe selection of CWE-754 is at a higher level of abstraction (Class) because the description points to a generalized lack of proper checking rather than a highly specific error like a race condition. While resource allocation issues arise, the primary issue stems from the **improper check**, making CWE-754 the most fitting root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25
