# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-4332
## Query
An authentication bypass vulnerability has been identified in the REST and SOAP API components of Tripwire Enterprise (TE) 9.1.0 when TE is configured to use LDAP/Active Directory SAML authentication and its optional Auto-synchronize LDAP Users, Roles, and Groups feature is enabled. This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass authentication if a valid username is known. Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow remote attackers to gain privileged access to the APIs and lead to unauthorized information disclosure or modification.
