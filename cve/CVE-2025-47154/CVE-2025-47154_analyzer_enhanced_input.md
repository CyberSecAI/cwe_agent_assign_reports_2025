## Vulnerability Description
LibJS in Ladybird before f5a6704 **mishandles the freeing of the vector that arguments_list references**, leading to a **use-after-free**, and allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted .js file. NOTE the GitHub README says Ladybird is in a pre-alpha state, and only suitable for use by developers.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's an analysis of the provided content, focusing on the information relevant to the potential CVE and extracting relevant details:

**Analysis of Content**

The content from `jessie.cafe_bada3c9b_20250624_145818.html` appears to provide detailed information about a specific vulnerability found in the Ladybird browser's JavaScript engine, LibJS.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** A use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability on the interpreter’s argument buffer. It's triggered by using a proxied function object as a constructor, together with a malicious `[[Get]]` handler. The vulnerability occurs because the `arguments_list` vector can be freed and reallocated during the `ordinary_create_from_constructor` method, which is called before the arguments are used, leading to a dangling pointer.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free (UAF) in the interpreter’s argument buffer, Heap buffer overflow, freelist corruption in the garbage collector.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Allows for arbitrary code execution within the renderer. The exploit can lead to leaking an object, creating a fake object and arbitrary read/write.
*   **Attack vectors:** Triggered by JavaScript code that uses a proxied function object as a constructor.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to craft malicious JavaScript code that can be executed within the Ladybird browser's JavaScript engine. The attacker needs to be able to control the `[[Get]]` handler of a proxy object used as a constructor.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** The fix is to do the prototype `[[Get]]` strictly *after* the callee context has been constructed. The patch is located at [https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/commit/f5a670421954fc7130c3685b713c621b29516669](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/commit/f5a670421954fc7130c3685b713c621b29516669)
