  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved wifi rtw89 avoid to add interface to list twice when SER If SER L2 occurs during the WoWLAN resume flow, the add interface flow is triggered by ieee80211_reconfig(). However, due to **rtw89_wow_resume() return failure**, it will cause the add interface flow to be executed again, resulting in a double add list and causing a kernel panic. Therefore, we have added a check to prevent double adding of the list. list_add double add new=ffff99d6992e2010, prev=ffff99d6992e2010, next=ffff99d695302628. ------------[ cut here ]------------ kernel BUG at lib/list_debug.c37! invalid opcode 0000",

Specifically, when a SER L2 event occurs during a WoWLAN resume, the `ieee80211_reconfig()` function can be triggered multiple times. Because `rtw89_wow_resume()` may return failure, the interface add flow can execute repeatedly. This results in adding the same interface multiple times, leading to a kernel panic because the `list_add` operation detects an existing entry.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nThe impact of this vulnerability is a kernel panic, causing a denial of service. The double addition to a linked list corrupts the list structure, leading to a system crash.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe attack vector involves triggering a specific sequence of events during WoWLAN resume, specifically causing a SER L2 event.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nAn attacker would need to be in a position to influence the system behavior to trigger a SER L2 event during the WoWLAN resume flow. This likely requires some level of control over the wireless environment or the device's power management.",

CWE-834 Excessive Iteration (Base) was chosen to be more specific than the class level CWE-703 Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions. Also, there is a potential for the list_add operation to trigger an assertion, so CWE-617 could be a secondary issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe834[\"CWE-834: Excessive Iteration\"]\n    cwe617[\"CWE-617: Reachable Assertion\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe834 primary\n    class cwe617 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the `rtw89_wow_resume()` returning failure, leading to repeated execution of the add interface flow. This results in the double addition of the interface to the list, causing a kernel panic. Therefore:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **rtw89_wow_resume() return failure**\n2.  **Weakness:** Excessive Iteration (CWE-834) due to the lack of proper checks.\n3.  **Impact:** Kernel panic (Denial of Service).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered several CWEs, particularly those related to race conditions and improper locking. However, the core issue is not necessarily a race condition but rather the double addition of an interface due to repeated execution. The evidence supporting this is the \"double add list\" and \"causing a kernel panic\" description.\n\nThe selection of CWE-834 is based on the repeated execution of the add interface flow, leading to a potential excessive iteration scenario. While there is a potential for this to trigger an assertion (CWE-617), the primary weakness is the excessive iteration.\n\nThe evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly indicates the root cause: \"Because `rtw89_wow_resume()` may return failure, the interface add flow can execute repeatedly. This results in adding the same interface multiple times, leading to a kernel panic because the `list_add` operation detects an existing entry.\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity.
