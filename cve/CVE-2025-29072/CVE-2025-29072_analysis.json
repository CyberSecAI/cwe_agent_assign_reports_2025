Community Forum Post (community.starknet.io)**\n\nThis content *is* relevant. It details a potential full node vulnerability in Starknet discovered by Guanxing Wen of CertiK.\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow in the Sierra bytecode decompression logic of Cairo classes when handling v2 or v3 Declare transactions.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper overflow checks in full node implementations.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Full CPU saturation of affected nodes, potentially leading to shutdowns, service stalls, or halting interaction between nodes and Dapps.\n*   **Attack vectors:** Crafting a malicious Declare transaction with a carefully chosen overflow value.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to create and submit malicious Declare transactions to the network. No specific privileges are required.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** Implementing strict overflow settings and additional guardrails around integer handling in full node implementations. Updated build instructions were disseminated to node operators.\n*   **More detail than CVE description:** Yes, this provides a detailed technical explanation of the vulnerability, timeline of events, and mitigation steps.\n\n**2. GitHub Commit (github.com)**\n\nThis content *is* relevant. It shows a commit to the Juno project (a Starknet client) that addresses a compilation error related to overflow checks.\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The commit enables `overflow-checks` in the release profile of the `Cargo.toml` file. This addresses the integer overflow issue described in the community forum post.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of overflow checks during compilation.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:**  The commit aims to prevent the integer overflow vulnerability that could lead to CPU saturation.\n*   **Attack vectors:**  The same as described in the community forum post - malicious Declare transactions.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Same as above.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** Enabling `overflow-checks` during compilation.\n*   **More detail than CVE description:** Yes, this provides the specific code change made to address the vulnerability. The commit message explicitly links to the related issue (#2297) and mentions the fix for the Starknet compilation error.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nBoth sources describe the same vulnerability: an integer overflow in Starknet full nodes that could be exploited by malicious Declare transactions. The community forum post provides a high-level overview, while the GitHub commit shows the specific code change made to mitigate the issue.",

Addresses the resulting **infinite loop**. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) that directly leads to an **infinite loop** (CWE-835), causing a denial-of-service condition. CWE-190 can precede CWE-835, aligning with the vulnerability's progression.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe835[\"CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')\"]\n    \n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe835\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe835 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) in the Sierra bytecode decompression logic, which leads to an **infinite loop** (CWE-835). This infinite loop then causes high CPU usage, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description and the CVE reference links. The description explicitly states an **\"integer overflow\"** which aligns directly with CWE-190. The CVE reference links confirm the **integer overflow** as the root cause and mention the resulting high CPU usage and potential service stalls. The relationship between CWE-190 and CWE-835 further supports this analysis, as an **integer overflow** can often lead to unexpected program behavior, such as an **infinite loop**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-190 is a Base CWE, providing a precise description of the **integer overflow**. CWE-835 is also a Base CWE, accurately capturing the resulting **infinite loop** condition.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Reason for not selecting*: While recursion might be involved at some level, the core issue is the **integer overflow** leading to the infinite loop.\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for not selecting*: The issue is not related to excessive memory allocation.\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Reason for not selecting*: The description explicitly mentions an **integer overflow**, not an underflow.\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
