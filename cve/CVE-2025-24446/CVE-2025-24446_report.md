- **Version:** 2023.12, 2021.18, 2025.0 and earlier

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 1.0 | Class | Primary CWE | Discouraged |
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.5 | Class | Secondary Candidate | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis

The primary CWE is CWE-20, which is a class-level CWE. While it's generally discouraged to use class-level CWEs, the provided information does not allow for a more specific base or variant CWE to be selected. There are many child CWEs of CWE-20 but there is insufficient information to select one of them. CWE-863 is considered as a secondary candidate because the vulnerability requires admin panel privileges, implying an authorization context. The relationship between these two CWEs is less about direct hierarchy and more about potential co-occurrence. Improper Input Validation can often lead to authorization bypass scenarios, making CWE-863 a relevant but less directly supported consideration.

## Vulnerability Chain

The vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Input Validation** (CWE-20) which leads to potential arbitrary code execution.

## Summary of Analysis

The primary assessment is based on the provided evidence, which explicitly states that the root cause of the vulnerability is **Improper Input Validation**. The vulnerability description key phrases also highlight this **weakness**.

> *   **rootcause:** **improper input validation**
> *   **weakness:** **Improper Input Validation vulnerability**

The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" section also confirms this:

> *   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper Input Validation
> *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)

Given this explicit evidence, CWE-20 is the most appropriate primary CWE.

The graph relationships influenced the decision by highlighting potential follow-on weaknesses. While **Improper Input Validation** is the primary issue, the fact that admin panel privileges are required suggests that **Incorrect Authorization** (CWE-863) might also be a contributing factor or a consequence of the **improper input validation**. However, without more information, CWE-863 is a secondary consideration.

CWE-20 is at the class level, which is less specific than a base or variant. However, given the limited information available, it's the most accurate representation of the **weakness**.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.

## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges 
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions. This may cause it to follow unexpected code paths that may leave the product in an invalid state.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
During installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 1610.10
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 1551.90
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.
