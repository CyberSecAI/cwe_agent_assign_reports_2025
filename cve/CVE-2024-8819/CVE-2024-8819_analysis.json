  "description": "PDF-XChange Editor U3D File Parsing **Out-Of-Bounds Read** **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of U3D files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24214.",

The **lack of proper validation** is the root cause that permits the vulnerability to occur. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **out-of-bounds read** and the **lack of proper validation**.\n\nThe selection of CWE-125 is based on the explicit mention of **out-of-bounds read** in the vulnerability description, which states: \"The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer.\" This directly aligns with the description of CWE-125: \"The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\"\n\nThe secondary CWE, CWE-20, is added because the root cause is the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**. This aligns with the description of CWE-20: \"The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly.\"\n\nOther CWEs were considered but deemed less appropriate. CWE-787 (**Out-of-bounds Write**) was considered due to its high score, but the vulnerability is specifically about reading, not writing, past the buffer. CWE-1284 (**Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input**) was also considered but deemed less relevant than CWE-20, as the issue isn't solely related to quantity but general input validation.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n**CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read**\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n**CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**\nThe product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly.",
