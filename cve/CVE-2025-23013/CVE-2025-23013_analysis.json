  "description": "In Yubico pam-u2f before 1.3.1, local privilege escalation can sometimes occur. This product implements a Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) that can be deployed to support authentication using a YubiKey or other FIDO compliant authenticators on macOS or Linux. This software package has an issue that allows for an **authentication bypass in some configurations**. An attacker would require the ability to access the system as an unprivileged user. Depending on the configuration, the attacker may also need to know the users password.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-23013 based on provided content:\n\n**CVE Description:** The content confirms the CVE description relates to a partial authentication bypass in the `pam-u2f` software package.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   The `pam_sm_authenticate()` function in `pam-u2f` returns `PAM_IGNORE` in several error scenarios (memory allocation failure, privilege change failure, missing/corrupted authfile).\n*   `PAM_IGNORE` does not contribute to the final authentication decision, potentially bypassing the second factor or password-less login.\n*   The issue is exacerbated when the `nouserok` option is enabled, as `pam-u2f` returns `PAM_SUCCESS` if the authfile is missing or corrupted in that case.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Improper handling of error conditions in the `pam_sm_authenticate()` function.\n*   Use of `PAM_IGNORE` in situations where a failure should be indicated.\n*   Potential for authentication bypass due to incorrect return values.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   An attacker with local access can potentially bypass second-factor authentication or password-less login.\n*   Local privilege escalation is possible in certain configurations (e.g., user has sudo access).\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Memory exhaustion (triggering memory allocation errors).\n*   Removing or corrupting the authfile (when `nouserok` is enabled).\n*   Exploiting other error conditions that cause `PAM_IGNORE` to be returned.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Local access to the system.\n*   In some scenarios, knowledge of the user's password.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Upgrade to `pam-u2f` version 1.3.1 or later.\n*   As a temporary workaround, modify the PAM stack configuration to treat `PAM_IGNORE` as a failure (`success=ok default=bad`).\n*   Disable the `nouserok` option.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The advisory details specific scenarios and their associated CVSS scores, providing a more granular understanding of the risk.\n*   The advisory acknowledges the researcher who reported the vulnerability (Matthias Gerstner from SUSE).\n*   The advisory provides a timeline of the vulnerability disclosure and fix process.\n*   The advisory discusses the underlying issue of PAM's handling of return values and the lack of clear documentation.\n*   The advisory mentions potential issues with PAM's logic regarding utility modules and their return values.\n*   The advisory provides links to relevant resources, such as the GitHub repository and security advisories.",

CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) is also a child of CWE-287. The relationship between these CWEs indicates that CWE-306 and CWE-288 are more specific cases of the broader category of improper authentication. Given the evidence for missing authentication, CWE-306 is most appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe288 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe288 secondary\n    class cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** in the `pam_sm_authenticate()` function, leading to an **authentication bypass**, and ultimately resulting in local privilege escalation. The root cause is the **improper handling of error conditions** where `PAM_IGNORE` is returned, which doesn't contribute to the authentication decision.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis pointed towards an authentication bypass, but after reviewing the CVE reference links and the detailed explanation of the root cause, it became clear that the core issue is the **missing authentication** for critical functions due to the improper use of `PAM_IGNORE`. This leads to the **authentication bypass** which results in local privilege escalation. The selection of CWE-306 is based on the fact that the `pam_sm_authenticate()` function sometimes returns `PAM_IGNORE` which effectively bypasses authentication under certain conditions.\n\nThe decision is heavily based on the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which provides explicit details on the root cause and weakness. The evidence suggests that the system **fails to enforce authentication** under specific error conditions.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the final selection by highlighting the connection between CWE-306 and CWE-287. While CWE-287 is a broader category, CWE-306 more accurately reflects the specific weakness. The retriever scores also support this decision, as CWE-306 is among the top candidates.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause and the immediate consequence of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
