  "description": "sp-php-email-handler is a PHP package for handling contact form submissions. Messages sent using this script are vulnerable to abuse, as the script **allows anybody to specify arbitrary email recipients and include user-provided content in confirmation emails**. This could enable malicious actors to use your server to send spam, phishing emails, or other malicious content, potentially damaging your domains reputation and leading to blacklisting by email providers. Patched in version 1.0.0 by removing user-provided content from confirmation emails. All pre-release versions (alpha and beta) are vulnerable to this issue and should not be used. There are no workarounds for this issue. Users must upgrade to version 1.0.0 to mitigate the vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-53860:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the `SPEmailHandler-PHP` script's handling of user-provided data in confirmation emails. Specifically, the script includes the user-provided message content in the confirmation email sent to the user.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n- **Unvalidated User Input:** The script directly incorporates user-provided content into the email body without proper sanitization or validation.\n- **Email Injection/Abuse:** The script allows arbitrary email recipients and includes user-provided content, which can be exploited.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Spam/Phishing:** Malicious actors can use the server running the script to send spam and phishing emails.\n- **Reputation Damage:** Exploitation can damage the domain's reputation and lead to blacklisting by email providers.\n- **Malicious Content Delivery:** The vulnerability enables the attacker to include malicious content in the emails.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **No Privileges Required:** No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.\n- **No User Interaction:** The attack requires no user interaction.\n- The attacker needs to be able to submit the contact form or interact with the vulnerable script in a manner that allows them to provide arbitrary input.\n\n**Additional Information:**\nThe fix for this vulnerability, introduced in version 1.0.0, involves removing the user-provided content from the confirmation emails. The vulnerable code was in `src/EmailHandler.php`, where the user's message was included in the email body. The patched version constructs the email without the user message.\n\nThe CVE description mentions a CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) classification. The provided content also provides a CVSS v3 score which rates the severity as high (8.6) with CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N, where:\n- AV:N (Attack Vector: Network)\n- AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low)\n- PR:N (Privileges Required: None)\n- UI:N (User Interaction: None)\n- S:C (Scope: Changed)\n- C:N (Confidentiality: None)\n- I:H (Integrity: High)\n- A:N (Availability: None)",

  "analysis": "# Summary\n| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| CWE-918 | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) | 0.8 | Base | Primary | Allowed |\n| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |\n| CWE-472 | External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter | 0.5 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the decision was the understanding of the vulnerability as a form of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), due to the ability to specify arbitrary email recipients. Although email sending is the intended functionality, the ability to control the recipients turns it into a SSRF-like issue. Additionally, the insertion of user-provided content into emails represents an insertion of sensitive data. The external control of assumed immutable web parameters is considered because the email recipient could be regarded as such. The abstraction levels were considered to choose base-level CWEs for specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe472[\"CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\"]\n    \n    cwe201 -->|PEEROF| cwe918\n    cwe472 -->|PEEROF| cwe918\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe918 primary\n    class cwe201,cwe472 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of user-provided input**, specifically the lack of validation and sanitization. This leads to the ability to **specify arbitrary email recipients** (**Server-Side Request Forgery**) and **include user-provided content in confirmation emails** (**Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data**). The impact of this chain is the potential for **sending spam, phishing emails, and other malicious content**, which can **damage the domain's reputation**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered the retriever results and the vulnerability description. The primary concern was to identify the root cause and the immediate weaknesses. While CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) was suggested, it was deemed too broad. The choice of CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery) as the primary CWE stems from the fact that the vulnerability allows an attacker to use the email functionality to send emails to arbitrary recipients, effectively turning the email system into a form of SSRF. CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) was chosen because the user-provided content is directly inserted into the email.\n\nThe selection of base-level CWEs like CWE-918, CWE-201, and CWE-472 provides a more accurate and specific representation of the vulnerability than higher-level classifications. The evidence directly supports these classifications, as highlighted in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" section: \"**allows anybody to specify arbitrary email recipients and include user-provided content in confirmation emails**\".\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
