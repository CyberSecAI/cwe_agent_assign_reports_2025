While no direct parent-child relationship is explicitly listed for CWE-598 in the provided relationships, it inherently falls under the broader category of transmitting sensitive information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe598[\"CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    \n    cwe598 -->|PEEROF| cwe201\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe598 primary\n    class cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the application's design choice to use GET requests for sensitive information. This leads to the **insertion of sensitive information into sent data** (CWE-201) via the URL. An attacker can then craft a GET request to obtain this information.\n  - Root Cause: CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings\n  - Impact: CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data. Obtain sensitive user information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-598 (Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings) because the vulnerability description explicitly states that the sensitive information is being obtained via a crafted GET request. This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-598.\n\nCWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) is considered as a secondary candidate because it describes the general case of sensitive information being included in sent data, but CWE-598 is a more specific case of this happening via GET requests.\n\nThe evidence for this assessment comes directly from the Vulnerability Description: \"An issue in Zalo v23.09.01 allows attackers to obtain sensitive user information via a **crafted GET request**.\"\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-598 being a Variant and CWE-201 being a Base. This provides a good balance between specificity and broad applicability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This CWE is about missing authorization, but the description focuses on a crafted GET Request\n\n## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This CWE is about observable differences in behavior, which is not the focus of the provided description.\n\n## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* While sensitive information is transmitted, the core issue is the use of GET, not necessarily cleartext.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* Too general.
