## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6289:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the "WPS Hide Login" plugin's failure to properly prevent redirects to the login page through the WordPress `auth_redirect` function. This allows unauthorized users to access the hidden login page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** The plugin is intended to hide the login page, but due to the vulnerability, the location of the login page is exposed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can bypass the login page hiding mechanism and gain access to the login page. This allows them to attempt brute-force attacks or other login-based attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through crafted URLs that leverage the `auth_redirect` function, such as using GravityForms with a specific parameter. 
- Example: `https://example.com/?gf_page=randomstring`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs no prior authentication, can be unauthenticated, and can be a remote user.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable website.
- The attacker needs to know how to trigger the redirect (e.g., by using the specific GravityForms parameter as provided in the PoC).
