  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2024-29068', description='In snapd versions prior to 2.62, snapd failed to properly check the file type when extracting a snap. The snap format is a squashfs file-system image and so can contain files that are non-regular files (such as pipes or sockets etc). Various file entries within the snap squashfs image (such as icons etc) are directly read by snapd when it is extracted. An attacker who could convince a user to install a malicious snap which contained non-regular files at these paths could then cause snapd to block indefinitely trying to read from such files and cause a denial of service.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'improper file type check', 'weakness': '', 'impact': 'denial of service', 'vector': '', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'snapd', 'version': 'prior to 2.62', 'component': ''}, reference_content='Based on the provided content, here\\'s an analysis of the vulnerability:\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\n\\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of symbolic links (symlinks) within snap packages. Specifically, the code did not properly prevent symlinks from pointing outside the container, or to potentially problematic locations like the root directory (`.`) or the `meta` directory.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n\\n*   **External Symlink Vulnerability:** The code did not adequately check if a symlink target was external to the snap container. An attacker could potentially create a symlink that points to a location outside the snap\\'s intended scope.\\n*   **Bad Symlink Targets:** The code did not prevent symlinks pointing to `.` or `meta` directory.\\n*   **Inadequate Symlink Evaluation:** The initial implementation had a potential for infinite loops due to insufficient limits when evaluating nested symlinks, which was mitigated by introducing `maxDepth`.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n\\n*   **Arbitrary File Access (Potentially):** By creating malicious symlinks that point to sensitive locations outside the snap container, an attacker could potentially gain read or write access to arbitrary files on the system.\\n*   **Denial of Service (Potentially):**  If symlink loops were not handled correctly, they could have led to a denial of service. The introduction of `maxDepth` prevents infinite loop.\\n*   **Circumvention of Security Measures:**  Exploitation could bypass intended security restrictions by manipulating the file system access within the snap\\'s environment.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n\\n*   **Malicious Snap Package Creation:** An attacker could create a specially crafted snap package that includes malicious symlinks.\\n*   **Compromised Snap Store (Potentially):** If the attacker were able to compromise a snap store, they could distribute malicious snap packages.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n\\n*   **Ability to Create and Distribute Snap Packages:**  The attacker would need the ability to create their own snap packages and potentially distribute them through a channel where they will be installed.\\n*   **Understanding of Snap Package Structure:** The attacker would need knowledge about how snap packages are structured and how symlinks are handled.\\n\\n**Additional Details:**\\n\\n* The provided content shows a fix for this issue. The fix includes a new function `evalAndValidateSymlink` which evaluates symlinks and ensures that the target of a symlink is not external to the container. It also checks for symlinks that target \".\" or \"meta\" directories.\\n* The commit message \"many: container validation improvements\" indicates this is a broader change to improve validation and not just addressing one specific issue.\\n* Code review comments show concerns about the efficiency of string manipulation, which was addressed by using `strings.HasPrefix` instead of splitting and indexing the string.\\n\\nIn summary, the vulnerability allowed for malicious symlinks within snap packages to potentially escape the container, leading to arbitrary file access, denial of service, and circumvention of security measures. The provided code changes contain a fix which introduces proper symlink validation and prevents external symlinks, as well as symlinks pointing to \\'.\\' and \\'meta\\' directories.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '59', 'name': \"Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\", 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(545.2355551130357)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '23', 'name': 'Relative Path Traversal', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(516.5262008273623)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '22', 'name': \"Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\", 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(511.51523635471546)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '61', 'name': 'UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(505.93446685609297)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '923', 'name': 'Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints', 'source': 'sparse'}, 'similarity': np.float64(494.2072661451935)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '646', 'name': 'Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File', 'type': 'Variant', 'original_content': 'The product allows a file to be uploaded, but it relies on the file name or extension of the file to determine the appropriate behaviors.

NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-11736.\n\n- CVE-2021-21272: ORAS is open source software which enables a way to push OCI Artifacts to OCI Conformant registries. ORAS is both a CLI for initial testing and a Go Module. In ORAS from version 0.4.0 and before version 0.9.0, there is a \"zip-slip\" vulnerability. The directory support feature allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links and hard links. A well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who runs `oras pull`. Users of the affected versions are impacted if they are `oras` CLI users who runs `oras pull`, or if they are Go programs, which invoke `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`. The problem has been fixed in version 0.9.0. For `oras` CLI users, there is no workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider. For `oras` package users, the workaround is to not use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`, and use other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider.\n\n- CVE-2021-28650: autoar-extractor.c in GNOME gnome-autoar before 0.3.1, as used by GNOME Shell, Nautilus, and other software, allows Directory Traversal during extraction because it lacks a check of whether a file's parent is a symlink in certain complex situations. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-36241.\n\n- CVE-2021-32518: A vulnerability in share_link in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote attackers to create a symbolic link then access arbitrary files. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32803: The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.4.15, and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via insufficient symlink protection. `node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-32825: bblfshd is an open source self-hosted server for source code parsing. In bblfshd before commit 4265465b9b6fb5663c30ee43806126012066aad4 there is a \"zipslip\" vulnerability. The unsafe handling of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may enable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations outside the designated target folder. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive file. Additionally, if the attacker has read access to the unpacked files, he may be able to read arbitrary system files the parent process has permissions to read. For more details including a PoC see the referenced GHSL-2020-258.\n\n- CVE-2021-36286: Dell SupportAssist Client Consumer versions 3.9.13.0 and any versions prior to 3.9.13.0 contain an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability that can be exploited by using the Windows feature of NTFS called Symbolic links. Symbolic links can be created by any(non-privileged) user under some object directories, but by themselves are not sufficient to successfully escalate privileges. However, combining them with a different object, such as the NTFS junction point allows for the exploitation. Support assist clean files functionality do not distinguish junction points from the physical folder and proceeds to clean the target of the junction that allows nonprivileged users to create junction points and delete arbitrary files on the system which can be accessed only by the admin.\n\n- CVE-2021-38511: An issue was discovered in the tar crate before 0.4.36 for Rust. When symlinks are present in a TAR archive, extraction can create arbitrary directories via .. traversal.\n\n- CVE-2021-29136: Open Container Initiative umoci before 0.4.7 allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary host paths via a crafted image that causes symlink traversal when \"umoci unpack\" or \"umoci raw unpack\" is used.\n\n- CVE-2020-27833: A Zip Slip vulnerability was found in the oc binary in openshift-clients where an arbitrary file write is achieved by using a specially crafted raw container image (.tar file) which contains symbolic links. The vulnerability is limited to the command `oc image extract`. If a symbolic link is first created pointing within the tarball, this allows further symbolic links to bypass the existing path check. This flaw allows the tarball to create links outside the tarball's parent directory, allowing for executables or configuration files to be overwritten, resulting in arbitrary code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. Versions up to and including openshift-clients-4.7.0-202104250659.p0.git.95881af are affected.\n\n- CVE-2020-27697: Trend Micro Security 2020 (Consumer) contains a vulnerability in the installer package that could be exploited by placing a malicious DLL in a non-protected location with high privileges (symlink attack) which can lead to obtaining administrative privileges during the installation of the product.\n\n- CVE-2020-4717: A vulnerability exists in IBM SPSS Modeler Subscription Installer that allows a user with create symbolic link permission to write arbitrary file in another protected path during product installation. IBM X-Force ID: 187727.\n\n- CVE-2021-23239: The sudoedit personality of Sudo before 1.9.5 may allow a local unprivileged user to perform arbitrary directory-existence tests by winning a sudo_edit.c race condition in replacing a user-controlled directory by a symlink to an arbitrary path.\n\n- CVE-2021-32508: Absolute Path Traversal vulnerability in FileStreaming in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote authenticated attackers access arbitrary files by injecting the Symbolic Link following the Url path parameter. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32509: Absolute Path Traversal vulnerability in FileviewDoc in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote authenticated attackers access arbitrary files by injecting the Symbolic Link following the Url path parameter.

It affects multi-user setups in which \u2019guix-daemon\u2019 runs locally. The attack consists in having an unprivileged user spawn a build process, for instance with `guix build`, that makes its build directory world-writable. The user then creates a hardlink to a root-owned file such as /etc/shadow in that build directory. If the user passed the --keep-failed option and the build eventually fails, the daemon changes ownership of the whole build tree, including the hardlink, to the user. At that point, the user has write access to the target file. Versions after and including v0.11.0-3298-g2608e40988, and versions prior to v1.2.0-75109-g94f0312546 are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2020-28007: Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Execution with Unnecessary Privileges. Because Exim operates as root in the log directory (owned by a non-root user), a symlink or hard link attack allows overwriting critical root-owned files anywhere on the filesystem.\n\n- CVE-2021-22488: There is an Unauthorized file access vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability by modifying soft links may tamper with the files restored from backups.\n\n- CVE-2021-23872: Privilege Escalation vulnerability in the File Lock component of McAfee Total Protection (MTP) prior to 16.0.32 allows a local user to gain elevated privileges by manipulating a symbolic link in the IOCTL interface.\n\n- CVE-2021-23873: Privilege Escalation vulnerability in McAfee Total Protection (MTP) prior to 16.0.30 allows a local user to gain elevated privileges and perform arbitrary file deletion as the SYSTEM user potentially causing Denial of Service via manipulating Junction link, after enumerating certain files, at a specific time.\n\n- CVE-2021-34408: The Zoom Client for Meetings for Windows in all versions before version 5.3.2 writes log files to a user writable directory as a privileged user during the installation or update of the client. This could allow for potential privilege escalation if a link was created between the user writable directory used and a non-user writable directory.\n\n- CVE-2021-36744: Trend Micro Security (Consumer) 2021 and 2020 are vulnerable to a directory junction vulnerability which could allow an attacker to exploit the system to escalate privileges and create a denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2021-37969: Inappropriate implementation in Google Updater in Google Chrome on Windows prior to 94.0.4606.54 allowed a remote attacker to perform local privilege escalation via a crafted file.\n\n- CVE-2021-44038: An issue was discovered in Quagga through 1.2.4. Unsafe chown/chmod operations in the suggested spec file allow users (with control of the non-root-owned directory /etc/quagga) to escalate their privileges to root upon package installation or update.\n\n- CVE-2021-31843: Improper privileges management vulnerability in McAfee Endpoint Security (ENS) Windows prior to 10.7.0 September 2021 Update allows local users to access files which they would otherwise not have access to via manipulating junction links to redirect McAfee folder operations to an unintended location. \n\n- CVE-2020-7346: Privilege Escalation vulnerability in McAfee Data Loss Prevention (DLP) for Windows prior to 11.6.100 allows a local, low privileged, attacker through the use of junctions to cause the product to load DLLs of the attacker's choosing.

By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-37032: Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a.

A path traversal vulnerability exists in versions prior to 15.3.18, 15.5.3, and 16.0.0. Using a specially prepared ZIP file, it is possible to overwrite any file that is writable by the application server user (e.g. the tomcat user). Depending on the configuration this can be limited to files of the OpenOlat user data directory, however, if not properly set up, the attack could also be used to overwrite application server config files, java code or even operating system files. The attack could be used to corrupt or modify any OpenOlat file such as course structures, config files or temporary test data. Those attack would require in-depth knowledge of the installation and thus more theoretical. If the app server configuration allows the execution of jsp files and the path to the context is known, it is also possible to execute java code. If the app server runs with the same user that is used to deploy the OpenOlat code or has write permissions on the OpenOlat code files and the path to the context is know, code injection is possible. The attack requires an OpenOlat user account to upload a ZIP file and trigger the unzip method. It can not be exploited by unregistered users. The problem is fixed in versions 15.3.18, 15.5.3 and 16.0.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.\n\n- CVE-2020-19146: Improper Access Control in Jfinal CMS v4.7.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via the 'TemplatePath' parameter in the component 'jfinal_cms/admin/folder/list'.\n\n- CVE-2020-19147: Improper Access Control in Jfinal CMS v4.7.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive infromation via the 'getFolder()' function in the component '/modules/filemanager/FileManager.java'.\n\n- CVE-2020-26806: admin/file.do in ObjectPlanet Opinio before 7.15 allows Unrestricted File Upload of executable JSP files, resulting in remote code execution, because filePath can have directory traversal and fileContent can be valid JSP code.\n\n- CVE-2021-20034: An improper access control vulnerability in SMA100 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to bypass the path traversal checks and delete an arbitrary file potentially resulting in a reboot to factory default settings.\n\n- CVE-2021-23428: This affects all versions of package elFinder.NetCore.

The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation of URLs in HTTP requests processed by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request containing directory traversal character sequences to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view arbitrary files within the web services file system on the targeted device. The web services file system is enabled when the affected device is configured with either WebVPN or AnyConnect features. This vulnerability cannot be used to obtain access to ASA or FTD system files or underlying operating system (OS) files.\n\n- CVE-2020-11652: An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt before 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. The salt-master process ClearFuncs class allows access to some methods that improperly sanitize paths. These methods allow arbitrary directory access to authenticated users.\n\n- CVE-2020-1631: A vulnerability in the HTTP/HTTPS service used by J-Web, Web Authentication, Dynamic-VPN (DVPN), Firewall Authentication Pass-Through with Web-Redirect, and Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) allows an unauthenticated attacker to perform local file inclusion (LFI) or path traversal. Using this vulnerability, an attacker may be able to inject commands into the httpd.log, read files with 'world' readable permission file or obtain J-Web session tokens. In the case of command injection, as the HTTP service runs as user 'nobody', the impact of this command injection is limited. (CVSS score 5.3, vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) In the case of reading files with 'world' readable permission, in Junos OS 19.3R1 and above, the unauthenticated attacker would be able to read the configuration file. (CVSS score 5.9, vector CVSS:3.1/ AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) If J-Web is enabled, the attacker could gain the same level of access of anyone actively logged into J-Web. If an administrator is logged in, the attacker could gain administrator access to J-Web. (CVSS score 8.8, vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) This issue only affects Juniper Networks Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services enabled. Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services disabled are not affected. If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled, the following command will show the httpd processes: user@device> show system processes | match http 5260 - S 0:00.13 /usr/sbin/httpd-gk -N 5797 - I 0:00.10 /usr/sbin/httpd --config /jail/var/etc/httpd.conf To summarize: If HTTP/HTTPS services are disabled, there is no impact from this vulnerability. If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled and J-Web is not in use, this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.9 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N). If J-Web is enabled, this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Juniper SIRT has received a single report of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild. Out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying customers so they can take appropriate actions. Indicators of Compromise: The /var/log/httpd.log may have indicators that commands have injected or files being accessed. The device administrator can look for these indicators by searching for the string patterns \"=*;*&\" or \"*%3b*&\" in /var/log/httpd.log, using the following command: user@device> show log httpd.log | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" If this command returns any output, it might be an indication of malicious attempts or simply scanning activities. Rotated logs should also be reviewed, using the following command: user@device> show log httpd.log.0.gz | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" user@device> show log httpd.log.1.gz | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" Note that a skilled attacker would likely remove these entries from the local log file, thus effectively eliminating any reliable signature that the device had been attacked. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.3 versions prior to 12.3R12-S16; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D101, 12.3X48-D105; 14.1X53 versions prior to 14.1X53-D54; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S7; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D211, 15.1X49-D220; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R7-S8; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R3-S4; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S8; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S11, 17.4R3-S2; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S10; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2-S7, 18.2R3-S4; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3-S2; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S7, 18.4R3-S2 ; 18.4 version 18.4R2 and later versions; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R1-S5, 19.1R3-S1; 19.1 version 19.1R2 and later versions; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S3, 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S2, 19.4R2; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S1, 20.1R2.\n\n- CVE-2020-4430: IBM Data Risk Manager 2.0.1, 2.0.2, 2.0.3, and 2.0.4 could allow a remote authenticated attacker to traverse directories on the system.

Argo CD starting with version 1.3.0 but before versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0 is vulnerable to a path traversal bug, compounded by an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious user with read-only repository access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user who has been granted `get` access for a repository containing a Helm chart can craft an API request to the `/api/v1/repositories/{repo_url}/appdetails` endpoint to leak the contents of out-of-bounds files from the repo-server. The malicious payload would reference an out-of-bounds file, and the contents of that file would be returned as part of the response. Contents from a non-YAML file may be returned as part of an error message. The attacker would have to know or guess the location of the target file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include files from other Applications' source repositories or any secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. This vulnerability is patched in Argo CD versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0. The patches prevent path traversal and limit access to users who either A) have been granted Application `create` privileges or B) have been granted Application `get` privileges and are requesting details for a `repo_url` that has already been used for the given Application. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-27925: Zimbra Collaboration (aka ZCS) 8.8.15 and 9.0 has mboximport functionality that receives a ZIP archive and extracts files from it.

An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration \"require all denied\", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.\n\n- CVE-2022-41352: An issue was discovered in Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) 8.8.15 and 9.0. An attacker can upload arbitrary files through amavis via a cpio loophole (extraction to /opt/zimbra/jetty/webapps/zimbra/public) that can lead to incorrect access to any other user accounts. Zimbra recommends pax over cpio. Also, pax is in the prerequisites of Zimbra on Ubuntu; however, pax is no longer part of a default Red Hat installation after RHEL 6 (or CentOS 6). Once pax is installed, amavis automatically prefers it over cpio.\n\n- CVE-2022-3966: A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Ultimate Member Plugin up to 2.5.0. This issue affects the function load_template of the file includes/core/class-shortcodes.php of the component Template Handler. The manipulation of the argument tpl leads to pathname traversal.

This is accomplished by extracting package contents into a project's `node_modules` folder. If the `node_modules` folder of the root project or any of its dependencies is somehow replaced with a symbolic link, it could allow Arborist to write package dependencies to any arbitrary location on the file system. Note that symbolic links contained within package artifact contents are filtered out, so another means of creating a `node_modules` symbolic link would have to be employed. 1. A `preinstall` script could replace `node_modules` with a symlink. (This is prevented by using `--ignore-scripts`.) 2. An attacker could supply the target with a git repository, instructing them to run `npm install --ignore-scripts` in the root. This may be successful, because `npm install --ignore-scripts` is typically not capable of making changes outside of the project directory, so it may be deemed safe. This is patched in @npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above. For more information including workarounds please see the referenced GHSA-gmw6-94gg-2rc2.\n\n- CVE-2021-1612: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software CLI could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the local system. This vulnerability is due to improper access controls on files within the local file system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a symbolic link in a specific location on the local file system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on an affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-26089: An improper symlink following in FortiClient for Mac 6.4.3 and below may allow an non-privileged user to execute arbitrary privileged shell commands during installation phase.\n\n- CVE-2022-20720: Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOx application hosting environment on multiple Cisco platforms could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying host operating system, execute arbitrary code on the underlying host operating system, install applications without being authenticated, or conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the affected software. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2022-26612: In Apache Hadoop, The unTar function uses unTarUsingJava function on Windows and the built-in tar utility on Unix and other OSes. As a result, a TAR entry may create a symlink under the expected extraction directory which points to an external directory. A subsequent TAR entry may extract an arbitrary file into the external directory using the symlink name. This however would be caught by the same targetDirPath check on Unix because of the getCanonicalPath call. However on Windows, getCanonicalPath doesn't resolve symbolic links, which bypasses the check. unpackEntries during TAR extraction follows symbolic links which allows writing outside expected base directory on Windows. This was addressed in Apache Hadoop 3.2.3\n\n- CVE-2022-3592: A symlink following vulnerability was found in Samba, where a user can create a symbolic link that will make 'smbd' escape the configured share path. This flaw allows a remote user with access to the exported part of the file system under a share via SMB1 unix extensions or NFS to create symlinks to files outside the 'smbd' configured share path and gain access to another restricted server's filesystem.\n\n- CVE-2022-36113: Cargo is a package manager for the rust programming language. After a package is downloaded, Cargo extracts its source code in the ~/.cargo folder on disk, making it available to the Rust projects it builds. To record when an extraction is successful, Cargo writes \"ok\" to the .cargo-ok file at the root of the extracted source code once it extracted all the files. It was discovered that Cargo allowed packages to contain a .cargo-ok symbolic link, which Cargo would extract. Then, when Cargo attempted to write \"ok\" into .cargo-ok, it would actually replace the first two bytes of the file the symlink pointed to with ok. This would allow an attacker to corrupt one file on the machine using Cargo to extract the package. Note that by design Cargo allows code execution at build time, due to build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerabilities in this advisory allow performing a subset of the possible damage in a harder to track down way. Your dependencies must still be trusted if you want to be protected from attacks, as it's possible to perform the same attacks with build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerability is present in all versions of Cargo. Rust 1.64, to be released on September 22nd, will include a fix for it. Since the vulnerability is just a more limited way to accomplish what a malicious build scripts or procedural macros can do, we decided not to publish Rust point releases backporting the security fix. Patch files are available for Rust 1.63.0 are available in the wg-security-response repository for people building their own toolchain. Mitigations We recommend users of alternate registries to exercise care in which package they download, by only including trusted dependencies in their projects. Please note that even with these vulnerabilities fixed, by design Cargo allows arbitrary code execution at build time thanks to build scripts and procedural macros: a malicious dependency will be able to cause damage regardless of these vulnerabilities. crates.io implemented server-side checks to reject these kinds of packages years ago, and there are no packages on crates.io exploiting these vulnerabilities. crates.io users still need to exercise care in choosing their dependencies though, as remote code execution is allowed by design there as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24904: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with version 0.7.0 and prior to versions 2.1.15m 2.2.9, and 2.3.4 is vulnerable to a symlink following bug allowing a malicious user with repository write access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user with write access for a repository which is (or may be) used in a directory-type Application may commit a symlink which points to an out-of-bounds file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include manifest files from other Applications' source repositories (potentially decrypted files, if you are using a decryption plugin) or any JSON-formatted secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.4, 2.2.9, and 2.1.15. Users of versions 2.3.0 or above who do not have any Jsonnet/directory-type Applications may disable the Jsonnet/directory config management tool as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-35631: On MacOS and Linux, it may be possible to perform a symlink attack by replacing this predictable file name with a symlink to another file and have the Velociraptor client overwrite the other file. This issue was resolved in Velociraptor 0.6.5-2.\n\n- CVE-2022-45440: A vulnerability exists in the FTP server of the Zyxel AX7501-B0 firmware prior to V5.17(ABPC.3)C0, which processes symbolic links on external storage media. A local authenticated attacker with administrator privileges could abuse this vulnerability to access the root file system by creating a symbolic link on external storage media, such as a USB flash drive, and then logging into the FTP server on a vulnerable device.\n\n- CVE-2022-21944: A UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following vulnerability in the systemd service file for watchman of openSUSE Backports SLE-15-SP3, Factory allows local attackers to escalate to root. This issue affects: openSUSE Backports SLE-15-SP3 watchman versions prior to 4.9.0. openSUSE Factory watchman versions prior to 4.9.0-9.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-31250: A UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following vulnerability in keylime of openSUSE Tumbleweed allows local attackers to escalate from the keylime user to root.

CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).\n\n- CVE-2000-1218: DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query, leading to cache poisoning\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-29416: An issue was discovered in PortSwigger Burp Suite before 2021.2. During viewing of a malicious request, it can be manipulated into issuing a request that does not respect its upstream proxy configuration. This could leak NetNTLM hashes on Windows systems that fail to block outbound SMB.\n\n- CVE-2021-30127: TerraMaster F2-210 devices through 2021-04-03 use UPnP to make the admin web server accessible over the Internet on TCP port 8181, which is arguably inconsistent with the \"It is only available on the local network\" documentation. NOTE: manually editing /etc/upnp.json provides a partial but undocumented workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31810: An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.6.7, 2.7.x through 2.7.3, and 3.x through 3.0.1. A malicious FTP server can use the PASV response to trick Net::FTP into connecting back to a given IP address and port. This potentially makes curl extract information about services that are otherwise private and not disclosed (e.g., the attacker can conduct port scans and service banner extractions).\n\n- CVE-2021-20999: In Weidm\u00fcller u-controls and IoT-Gateways in versions up to 1.12.1 a network port intended only for device-internal usage is accidentally accessible via external network interfaces. By exploiting this vulnerability the device may be manipulated or the operation may be stopped.\n\n- CVE-2021-21210: Inappropriate implementation in Network in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.72 allowed a remote attacker to potentially access local UDP ports via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-42343: An issue was discovered in the Dask distributed package before 2021.10.0 for Python. Single machine Dask clusters started with dask.distributed.LocalCluster or dask.distributed.Client (which defaults to using LocalCluster) would mistakenly configure their respective Dask workers to listen on external interfaces (typically with a randomly selected high port) rather than only on localhost. A Dask cluster created using this method (when running on a machine that has an applicable port exposed) could be used by a sophisticated attacker to achieve remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2021-22916: In Brave Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.26.60, when adblocking is enabled and a proxy browser extension is installed, the CNAME adblocking feature issues DNS requests that used the system DNS settings instead of the extension's proxy settings, resulting in possible information disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2021-22917: Brave Browser Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.20 is vulnerable to information disclosure by way of DNS requests in Tor windows not flowing through Tor if adblocking was enabled.\n\n- CVE-2020-4062: In Conjur OSS Helm Chart before 2.0.0, a recently identified critical vulnerability resulted in the installation of the Conjur Postgres database with an open port. This allows an attacker to gain full read & write access to the Conjur Postgres database, including escalating the attacker's privileges to assume full control. A malicious actor who knows the IP address and port number of the Postgres database and has access into the Kubernetes cluster where Conjur runs can gain full read & write access to the Postgres database. This enables the attacker to write a policy that allows full access to retrieve any secret. This Helm chart is a method to install Conjur OSS into a Kubernetes environment. Hence, the systems impacted are only Conjur OSS systems that were deployed using this chart. Other deployments including Docker and the CyberArk Dynamic Access Provider (DAP) are not affected. To remediate this vulnerability, clone the latest Helm Chart and follow the upgrade instructions. If you are not able to fully remediate this vulnerability immediately, you can mitigate some of the risk by making sure Conjur OSS is deployed on an isolated Kubernetes cluster or namespace. The term \"isolated\" refers to: - No other workloads besides Conjur OSS and its backend database are running in that Kubernetes cluster/namespace. - Kubernetes and helm access to the cluster/namespace is limited to security administrators via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).\n\n- CVE-2020-10087: GitLab before 12.8.2 allows Information Disclosure. Badge images were not being proxied, causing mixed content warnings as well as leaking the IP address of the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-32690: Helm is a tool for managing Charts (packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources). In versions of helm prior to 3.6.1, a vulnerability exists where the username and password credentials associated with a Helm repository could be passed on to another domain referenced by that Helm repository. This issue has been resolved in 3.6.1. There is a workaround through which one may check for improperly passed credentials. One may use a username and password for a Helm repository and may audit the Helm repository in order to check for another domain being used that could have received the credentials. In the `index.yaml` file for that repository, one may look for another domain in the `urls` list for the chart versions. If there is another domain found and that chart version was pulled or installed, the credentials would be passed on.\n\n- CVE-2021-32707: Nextcloud Mail is a mail app for Nextcloud. In versions prior to 1.9.6, the Nextcloud Mail application does not, by default, render images in emails to not leak the read state. The privacy filter failed to filter images with a `background-image` CSS attribute. Note that the images were still passed through the Nextcloud image proxy, and thus there was no IP leakage. The issue was patched in version 1.9.6 and 1.10.0. No workarounds are known to exist.\n\n- CVE-2020-14312: A flaw was found in the default configuration of dnsmasq, as shipped with Fedora versions prior to 31 and in all versions Red Hat Enterprise Linux, where it listens on any interface and accepts queries from addresses outside of its local subnet. In particular, the option `local-service` is not enabled. Running dnsmasq in this manner may inadvertently make it an open resolver accessible from any address on the internet. This flaw allows an attacker to conduct a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against other systems.\n\n- CVE-2021-20149: Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 does not have sufficient access controls for the WAN interface. The default iptables ruleset for governing access to services on the device only apply to IPv4. All services running on the devices are accessible via the WAN interface via IPv6 by default.\n\n- CVE-2020-1938: When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations.\n\n- CVE-2022-22547: Simple Diagnostics Agent - versions 1.0 (up to version 1.57.), allows an attacker to access information which would otherwise be restricted via a random port 9000-65535. This allows information gathering which could be used exploit future open-source security exploits.\n\n- CVE-2022-44784: An issue was discovered in Appalti & Contratti 9.12.2. The target web applications LFS and DL229 expose a set of services provided by the Axis 1.4 instance, embedded directly into the applications, as hinted by the WEB-INF/web.xml file leaked through Local File Inclusion. Among the exposed services, there is the Axis AdminService, which, through the default configuration, should normally be accessible only by the localhost. Nevertheless, by trying to access the mentioned service, both in LFS and DL229, the service can actually be reached even by remote users, allowing creation of arbitrary services on the server side. When an attacker can reach the AdminService, they can use it to instantiate arbitrary services on the server. The exploit procedure is well known and described in Generic AXIS-SSRF exploitation. Basically, the attack consists of writing a JSP page inside the root directory of the web application, through the org.apache.axis.handlers.LogHandler class.\n\n- CVE-2022-26834: Improper access control vulnerability in Rakuten Casa version AP_F_V1_4_1 or AP_F_V2_0_0 allows a remote attacker to obtain the information stored in the product because the product is set to accept HTTP connections from the WAN side by default.\n\n- CVE-2022-4390: A network misconfiguration is present in versions prior to 1.0.9.90 of the NETGEAR RAX30 AX2400 series of routers. IPv6 is enabled for the WAN interface by default on these devices. While there are firewall restrictions in place that define access restrictions for IPv4 traffic, these restrictions do not appear to be applied to the WAN interface for IPv6. This allows arbitrary access to any services running on the device that may be inadvertently listening via IPv6, such as the SSH and Telnet servers spawned on ports 22 and 23 by default. This misconfiguration could allow an attacker to interact with services only intended to be accessible by clients on the local network.\n\n- CVE-2022-45414: If a Thunderbird user quoted from an HTML email, for example by replying to the email, and the email contained either a VIDEO tag with the POSTER attribute or an OBJECT tag with a DATA attribute, a network request to the referenced remote URL was performed, regardless of a configuration to block remote content. An image loaded from the POSTER attribute was shown in the composer window. These issues could have given an attacker additional capabilities when targetting releases that did not yet have a fix for CVE-2022-3033 which was reported around three months ago. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.5.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-47717: Last Yard 22.09.8-1 is vulnerable to Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).\n\n- CVE-2022-3057: Inappropriate implementation in iframe Sandbox in Google Chrome prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-31055: kCTF is a Kubernetes-based infrastructure for capture the flag (CTF) competitions. Prior to version 1.6.0, the kctf cluster set-src-ip-ranges was broken and allowed traffic from any IP. The problem has been patched in v1.6.0. As a workaround, those who want to test challenges privately can mark them as `public: false` and use `kctf chal debug port-forward` to connect.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",

The TCP header processing code doesn't sanitize the value of the IP total length field (header length + data length). With a crafted IP packet, an integer overflow occurs whenever the value of the IP data length is calculated by subtracting the length of the header from the total length of the IP packet.\n\n- CVE-2021-31802: NETGEAR R7000 1.0.11.116 devices have a heap-based Buffer Overflow that is exploitable from the local network without authentication. The vulnerability exists within the handling of an HTTP request. An attacker can leverage this to execute code as root. The problem is that a user-provided length value is trusted during a backup.cgi file upload. The attacker must add a \\\\n before the Content-Length header.\n\n- CVE-2021-37663: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions due to incomplete validation in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeV2`, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/84d053187cb80d975ef2b9684d4b61981bca0c41/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_op.cc#L59) has some validation but does not check that `min_range` and `max_range` both have the same non-zero number of elements. If `axis` is provided (i.e., not `-1`), then validation should check that it is a value in range for the rank of `input` tensor and then the lengths of `min_range` and `max_range` inputs match the `axis` dimension of the `input` tensor. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 6da6620efad397c85493b8f8667b821403516708. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-37665: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions due to incomplete validation in MKL implementation of requantization, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/mkl/mkl_requantization_range_per_channel_op.cc) does not validate the dimensions of the `input` tensor. A similar issue occurs in `MklRequantizePerChannelOp`. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/mkl/mkl_requantize_per_channel_op.cc) does not perform full validation for all the input arguments. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 9e62869465573cb2d9b5053f1fa02a81fce21d69 and in the Github commit 203214568f5bc237603dbab6e1fd389f1572f5c9. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-3655: A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in versions prior to v5.14-rc1. Missing size validations on inbound SCTP packets may allow the kernel to read uninitialized memory.\n\n- CVE-2021-21404: Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program. In Syncthing before version 1.15.0, the relay server `strelaysrv` can be caused to crash and exit by sending a relay message with a negative length field. Similarly, Syncthing itself can crash for the same reason if given a malformed message from a malicious relay server when attempting to join the relay. Relay joins are essentially random (from a subset of low latency relays) and Syncthing will by default restart when crashing, at which point it's likely to pick another non-malicious relay. This flaw is fixed in version 1.15.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-1903: Possible denial of service scenario can occur due to lack of length check on Channel Switch Announcement IE in beacon or probe response frame in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer Electronics Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wired Infrastructure and Networking\n\n- CVE-2021-23906: An issue was discovered in the Headunit NTG6 in the MBUX Infotainment System on Mercedes-Benz vehicles through 2021. A Message Length is not checked in the HiQnet Protocol, leading to remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2021-31555: An issue was discovered in the Oauth extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. It did not validate the oarc_version (aka oauth_registered_consumer.oarc_version) parameter's length.\n\n- CVE-2021-33196: In archive/zip in Go before 1.15.13 and 1.16.x before 1.16.5, a crafted file count (in an archive's header) can cause a NewReader or OpenReader panic.\n\n- CVE-2021-33609: Missing check in DataCommunicator class in com.vaadin:vaadin-server versions 8.0.0 through 8.14.0 (Vaadin 8.0.0 through 8.14.0) allows authenticated network attacker to cause heap exhaustion by requesting too many rows of data.\n\n- CVE-2021-35041: The blockchain node in FISCO-BCOS V2.7.2 may have a bug when dealing with unformatted packet and lead to a crash. A malicious node can send a packet continuously. The packet is in an incorrect format and cannot be decoded by the node correctly. As a result, the node may consume the memory sustainably and crash. More details are shown at: https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/issues/1951\n\n- CVE-2020-7459: In FreeBSD 12.1-STABLE before r362166, 12.1-RELEASE before p8, 11.4-STABLE before r362167, 11.4-RELEASE before p2, and 11.3-RELEASE before p12, missing length validation code common to mulitple USB network drivers allows a malicious USB device to write beyond the end of an allocated network packet buffer.\n\n- CVE-2021-1084: NVIDIA vGPU driver contains a vulnerability in the guest kernel mode driver and Virtual GPU Manager (vGPU plugin), in which an input length is not validated, which may lead to information disclosure, tampering of data or denial of service. This affects vGPU version 12.x (prior to 12.2) and version 11.x (prior to 11.4).\n\n- CVE-2021-1097: NVIDIA vGPU software contains a vulnerability in the Virtual GPU Manager (vGPU plugin), where it improperly validates the length field in a request from a guest. This flaw allows a malicious guest to send a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the input, which may lead to information disclosure, data tampering, or denial of service.

Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-25727: Memory Corruption in modem due to improper length check while copying into memory in Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Voice & Music\n\n- CVE-2022-25793: A Stack-based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in Autodesk 3ds Max 2022, 2021, and 2020 may lead to code execution through the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer when parsing ActionScript Byte Code files.

Azure RTOS USBX implementation of host support for USB CDC ECM includes an integer underflow and a buffer overflow in the `_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function which may be potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution or denial of service. Setting mac address string descriptor length to a `0` or `1` allows an attacker to introduce an integer underflow followed (string_length) by a buffer overflow of the `cdc_ecm -> ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id` array. This may allow one to redirect the code execution flow or introduce a denial of service. The fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel).

Prior to version 0.10.2, the heap initialization methods were missing a minimum size check for the given heap size argument. This could lead to out-of-bound writes when a heap was initialized with a size smaller than `3 * size_of::<usize>` because of metadata write operations. This vulnerability impacts all the initialization functions on the `Heap` and `LockedHeap` types, including `Heap::new`, `Heap::init`, `Heap::init_from_slice`, and `LockedHeap::new`. It also affects multiple uses of the `Heap::extend` method. Version 0.10.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, ensure that the heap is only initialized with a size larger than `3 * size_of::<usize>` and that the `Heap::extend` method is only called with sizes larger than `2 * size_of::<usize>()`. Also, ensure that the total heap size is (and stays) a multiple of `2 * size_of::<usize>()`.\n\n- CVE-2022-36938: DexLoader function get_stringidx_fromdex() in Redex prior to commit 3b44c64 can load an out of bound address when loading the string index table, potentially allowing remote code execution during processing of a 3rd party Android APK file.\n\n- CVE-2021-1058: NVIDIA vGPU software contains a vulnerability in the guest kernel mode driver and vGPU plugin, in which an input data size is not validated, which may lead to tampering of data or denial of service.

Prior to commit number 0b962f218f0cdd796dadfe26c3f09e68f7861b26, a bug in `pallet-ethereum` can cause invalid transactions to be included in the Ethereum block state in `pallet-ethereum` due to not validating the input data size. Any invalid transactions included this way have no possibility to alter the internal Ethereum or Substrate state. The transaction will appear to have be included, but is of no effect as it is rejected by the EVM engine. The impact is further limited by Substrate extrinsic size constraints.

This crash affects the availability of the software and dependent downstream components.\n\n- CVE-2022-23580: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. During shape inference, TensorFlow can allocate a large vector based on a value from a tensor controlled by the user. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-29202: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.ragged.constant` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a denial of service by consuming all available memory. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36078: Binary provides encoding/decoding in Borsh and other formats. The vulnerability is a memory allocation vulnerability that can be exploited to allocate slices in memory with (arbitrary) excessive size value, which can either exhaust available memory or crash the whole program. When using `github.com/gagliardetto/binary` to parse unchecked (or wrong type of) data from untrusted sources of input (e.g. the blockchain) into slices, it's possible to allocate memory with excessive size. When `dec.Decode(&val)` method is used to parse data into a structure that is or contains slices of values, the length of the slice was previously read directly from the data itself without any checks on the size of it, and then a slice was allocated. This could lead to an overflow and an allocation of memory with excessive size value. Users should upgrade to `v0.7.1` or higher. A workaround is not to rely on the `dec.Decode(&val)` function to parse the data, but to use a custom `UnmarshalWithDecoder()` method that reads and checks the length of any slice.\n\n- CVE-2022-37311: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large location request parameter to the redirect servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-37312: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large request body containing a redirect URL to the deferrer servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-39294: conduit-hyper integrates a conduit application with the hyper server. Prior to version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` did not check any limit on a request's length before calling [`hyper::body::to_bytes`](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/body/fn.to_bytes.html). An attacker could send a malicious request with an abnormally large `Content-Length`, which could lead to a panic if memory allocation failed for that request. In version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` sets an internal limit of 128 MiB per request, otherwise returning status 400 (\"Bad Request\"). This crate is part of the implementation of Rust's [crates.io](https://crates.io/), but that service is not affected due to its existing cloud infrastructure, which already drops such malicious requests. Even with the new limit in place, `conduit-hyper` is not recommended for production use, nor to directly serve the public Internet.\n\n- CVE-2022-4111: Unrestricted file size limit can lead to DoS in tooljet/tooljet <1.27 by allowing a logged in attacker to upload profile pictures over 2MB. \n\n- CVE-2022-41968: Nextcloud Server is an open source personal cloud server. Prior to versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.5, calendar name lengths are not validated before writing to a database. As a result, an attacker can send unnecessary amounts of data against the database. Version 23.0.10 and 24.0.5 contain patches for the issue. No known workarounds are available.\n\n- CVE-2022-20488: In NotificationChannel of NotificationChannel.java, there is a possible failure to persist permissions settings due to resource exhaustion. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-12 Android-12L Android-13Android ID: A-242703217\n\n- CVE-2022-20491: In NotificationChannel of NotificationChannel.java, there is a possible failure to persist permissions settings due to resource exhaustion.

This vulnerability is due to missing length validation of certain Cisco Discovery Protocol packet header fields. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to exhaust available memory and cause the service to restart. Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability. \n\n- CVE-2022-21208: The package node-opcua before 2.74.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to a missing limitation on the number of received chunks - per single session or in total for all concurrent sessions. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending an unlimited number of huge chunks (e.g. 2GB each) without sending the Final closing chunk.\n\n- CVE-2022-29212: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, certain TFLite models that were created using TFLite model converter would crash when loaded in the TFLite interpreter. The culprit is that during quantization the scale of values could be greater than 1 but code was always assuming sub-unit scaling. Thus, since code was calling `QuantizeMultiplierSmallerThanOneExp`, the `TFLITE_CHECK_LT` assertion would trigger and abort the process. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29196: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackpropFilterV2` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate that the `filter_sizes` argument is a vector. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29200: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.LSTMBlockCell` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate the ranks of any of the arguments to this API call. This results in `CHECK`-failures when the elements of the tensor are accessed. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-789 (CanPrecede)",

If the token cannot match, the engine \"backtracks\" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.\n Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:\n\n\n  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.\n\n  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.\n\n  - The input can be long enough.\n\n Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. \n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-5243: server allows ReDOS with crafted User-Agent strings, due to overlapping capture groups that cause excessive backtracking.\n\n- CVE-2021-21317: npm package for user-agent parser prone to ReDoS due to overlapping capture groups\n\n- CVE-2019-16215: Markdown parser uses inefficient regex when processing a message, allowing users to cause CPU consumption and delay preventing processing of other messages.\n\n- CVE-2019-6785: Long string in a version control product allows DoS due to an inefficient regex.\n\n- CVE-2019-12041: Javascript code allows ReDoS via a long string due to excessive backtracking.\n\n- CVE-2015-8315: ReDoS when parsing time.\n\n- CVE-2015-8854: ReDoS when parsing documents.\n\n- CVE-2017-16021: ReDoS when validating URL.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-32740: Addressable is an alternative implementation to the URI implementation that is part of Ruby's standard library. An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability exists after version 2.3.0 through version 2.7.0. Within the URI template implementation in Addressable, a maliciously crafted template may result in uncontrolled resource consumption, leading to denial of service when matched against a URI. In typical usage, templates would not normally be read from untrusted user input, but nonetheless, no previous security advisory for Addressable has cautioned against doing this. Users of the parsing capabilities in Addressable but not the URI template capabilities are unaffected. The vulnerability is patched in version 2.8.0. As a workaround, only create Template objects from trusted sources that have been validated not to produce catastrophic backtracking.\n\n- CVE-2021-32763: OpenProject is open-source, web-based project management software. In versions prior to 11.3.3, the `MessagesController` class of OpenProject has a `quote` method that implements the logic behind the Quote button in the discussion forums, and it uses a regex to strip `<pre>` tags from the message being quoted. The `(.|\\\\s)` part can match a space character in two ways, so an unterminated `<pre>` tag containing `n` spaces causes Ruby's regex engine to backtrack to try 2<sup>n</sup> states in the NFA. This will result in a Regular Expression Denial of Service. The issue is fixed in OpenProject 11.3.3. As a workaround, one may install the patch manually.\n\n- CVE-2021-32838: Flask-RESTX (pypi package flask-restx) is a community driven fork of Flask-RESTPlus.

It affects all users using CKEditor 5 Markdown plugin at version <= 24.0.0. The problem has been recognized and patched. The fix will be available in version 25.0.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21267: Schema-Inspector is an open-source tool to sanitize and validate JS objects (npm package schema-inspector). In before version 2.0.0, email address validation is vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack where some input (for example `a@0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.`) will freeze the program or web browser page executing the code. This affects any current schema-inspector users using any version to validate email addresses. Users who do not do email validation, and instead do other types of validation (like string min or max length, etc), are not affected. Users should upgrade to version 2.0.0, which uses a regex expression that isn't vulnerable to ReDoS.\n\n- CVE-2021-21306: Marked is an open-source markdown parser and compiler (npm package \"marked\"). In marked from version 1.1.1 and before version 2.0.0, there is a Regular expression Denial of Service vulnerability. This vulnerability can affect anyone who runs user generated code through marked.

The maintainers found the patch for CVE-2021-43838 in jsx-slack v4.5.1 is insufficient tfor protection from a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. If an attacker can put a lot of JSX elements into `<blockquote>` tag _with including multibyte characters_, an internal regular expression for escaping characters may consume an excessive amount of computing resources. v4.5.1 passes the test against ASCII characters but misses the case of multibyte characters. jsx-slack v4.5.2 has updated regular expressions for escaping blockquote characters to prevent catastrophic backtracking. It is also including an updated test case to confirm rendering multiple tags in `<blockquote>` with multibyte characters.\n\n- CVE-2021-3733: There's a flaw in urllib's AbstractBasicAuthHandler class. An attacker who controls a malicious HTTP server that an HTTP client (such as web browser) connects to, could trigger a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDOS) during an authentication request with a specially crafted payload that is sent by the server to the client. The greatest threat that this flaw poses is to application availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-38244: A regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability exits in cbioportal 3.6.21 and older via a POST request to /ProteinArraySignificanceTest.json.\n\n- CVE-2021-39917: An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 12.9 before 14.3.6, all versions starting from 14.4 before 14.4.4, all versions starting from 14.5 before 14.5.2. A regular expression related to quick actions features was susceptible to catastrophic backtracking that could cause a DOS attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-43854: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a suite of open source Python modules, data sets, and tutorials supporting research and development in Natural Language Processing. Versions prior to 3.6.5 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. The vulnerability is present in PunktSentenceTokenizer, sent_tokenize and word_tokenize. Any users of this class, or these two functions, are vulnerable to the ReDoS attack. In short, a specifically crafted long input to any of these vulnerable functions will cause them to take a significant amount of execution time. If your program relies on any of the vulnerable functions for tokenizing unpredictable user input, then we would strongly recommend upgrading to a version of NLTK without the vulnerability. For users unable to upgrade the execution time can be bounded by limiting the maximum length of an input to any of the vulnerable functions. Our recommendation is to implement such a limit.\n\n- CVE-2021-23354: The package printf before 0.6.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the regex string /\\\\%(?:\\\\(([\\\\w_.]+)\\\\)|([1-9]\\\\d*)\\\\$)?([0 +\\\\-\\\\]*)(\\\\*|\\\\d+)?(\\\\.)?(\\\\*|\\\\d+)?[hlL]?([\\\\%bscdeEfFgGioOuxX])/g in lib/printf.js.

In affected versions Zulip allows organization administrators on a server to configure \"linkifiers\" that automatically create links from messages that users send, detected via arbitrary regular expressions. Malicious organization administrators could subject the server to a denial-of-service via regular expression complexity attacks; most simply, by configuring a quadratic-time regular expression in a linkifier, and sending messages that exploited it. A regular expression attempted to parse the user-provided regexes to verify that they were safe from ReDoS -- this was both insufficient, as well as _itself_ subject to ReDoS if the organization administrator entered a sufficiently complex invalid regex. Affected users should [upgrade to the just-released Zulip 4.7](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release), or [`main`](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-from-a-git-repository).\n\n- CVE-2021-41817: Date.parse in the date gem through 3.2.0 for Ruby allows ReDoS (regular expression Denial of Service) via a long string.

The exploitation of this vulnerability could be triggered via the parse function.\n\n- CVE-2022-21681: Marked is a markdown parser and compiler. Prior to version 4.0.10, the regular expression `inline.reflinkSearch` may cause catastrophic backtracking against some strings and lead to a denial of service (DoS). Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version of marked and does not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is patched in version 4.0.10. As a workaround, avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run marked on a worker thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources.\n\n- CVE-2022-24373: The package react-native-reanimated before 3.0.0-rc.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to improper usage of regular expression in the parser of Colors.js.\n\n- CVE-2022-24713: regex is an implementation of regular expressions for the Rust language. The regex crate features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service attacks caused by untrusted regexes, or untrusted input matched by trusted regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered part of the crate's API. Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing, and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to services accepting user-controlled, untrusted regexes. All versions of the regex crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this issue. The fix is include starting from regex 1.5.5. All users accepting user-controlled regexes are recommended to upgrade immediately to the latest version of the regex crate. Unfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are practically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability. Because of this, it us not recommend to deny known problematic regexes.\n\n- CVE-2022-25598: Apache DolphinScheduler user registration is vulnerable to Regular express Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks, Apache DolphinScheduler users should upgrade to version 2.0.5 or higher.\n\n- CVE-2022-25758: All versions of package scss-tokenizer are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the loadAnnotation() function, due to the usage of insecure regex.\n\n- CVE-2022-25844: The package angular after 1.7.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) by providing a custom locale rule that makes it possible to assign the parameter in posPre: ' '.repeat() of NUMBER_FORMATS.PATTERNS[1].posPre with a very high value. **Note:** 1) This package has been deprecated and is no longer maintained. 2) The vulnerable versions are 1.7.0 and higher.\n\n- CVE-2022-25858: The package terser before 4.8.1, from 5.0.0 and before 5.14.2 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to insecure usage of regular expressions.\n\n- CVE-2022-25887: The package sanitize-html before 2.7.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to insecure global regular expression replacement logic of HTML comment removal.\n\n- CVE-2022-25918: The package shescape from 1.5.10 and before 1.6.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the escape function in index.js, due to the usage of insecure regex in the escapeArgBash function.\n\n- CVE-2022-29158: Apache OFBiz up to version 18.12.05 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the way it handles URLs provided by external, unauthenticated users. Upgrade to 18.12.06 or apply patches at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-12599\n\n- CVE-2022-29167: Hawk is an HTTP authentication scheme providing mechanisms for making authenticated HTTP requests with partial cryptographic verification of the request and response, covering the HTTP method, request URI, host, and optionally the request payload. Hawk used a regular expression to parse `Host` HTTP header (`Hawk.utils.parseHost()`), which was subject to regular expression DoS attack - meaning each added character in the attacker's input increases the computation time exponentially. `parseHost()` was patched in `9.0.1` to use built-in `URL` class to parse hostname instead. `Hawk.authenticate()` accepts `options` argument. If that contains `host` and `port`, those would be used instead of a call to `utils.parseHost()`.\n\n- CVE-2022-29169: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions starting with 2.2 and prior to 2.3.19, 2.4.7, and 2.5.0-beta.2 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. By using specific a RegularExpression, an attacker can cause denial of service for the bbb-html5 service. The useragent library performs checking of device by parsing the input of User-Agent header and lets it go through lookupUserAgent() (alias of useragent.lookup() ). This function handles input by regexing and attackers can abuse that by providing some ReDos payload using `SmartWatch`. The maintainers removed `htmlclient/useragent` from versions 2.3.19, 2.4.7, and 2.5.0-beta.2. As a workaround, disable NginX forwarding the requests to the handler according to the directions in the GitHub Security Advisory.\n\n- CVE-2022-31129: moment is a JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates.

Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login.\n\n- CVE-2021-40654: An information disclosure issue exist in D-LINK-DIR-615 B2 2.01mt.

Invenio-Drafts-Resources prior to versions 0.13.7 and 0.14.6 does not properly check permissions when a record is published. The vulnerability is exploitable in a default installation of InvenioRDM. An authenticated a user is able via REST API calls to publish draft records of other users if they know the record identifier and the draft validates (e.g. all require fields filled out). An attacker is not able to modify the data in the record, and thus e.g. *cannot* change a record from restricted to public. The problem is patched in Invenio-Drafts-Resources v0.13.7 and 0.14.6, which is part of InvenioRDM v6.0.1 and InvenioRDM v7.0 respectively.\n\n- CVE-2020-11628: An issue was discovered in EJBCA before 6.15.2.6 and 7.x before 7.3.1.2. It is intended to support restriction of available remote protocols (CMP, ACME, REST, etc.) through the system configuration. These restrictions can be bypassed by modifying the URI string from a client. (EJBCA's internal access control restrictions are still in place, and each respective protocol must be configured to allow for enrollment.)\n\n- CVE-2020-13263: An authorization issue relating to project maintainer impersonation was identified in GitLab EE 9.5 and later through 13.0.1 that could allow unauthorized users to impersonate as a maintainer to perform limited actions.\n\n- CVE-2020-15126: In parser-server from version 3.5.0 and before 4.3.0, an authenticated user using the viewer GraphQL query can by pass all read security on his User object and can also by pass all objects linked via relation or Pointer on his User object.\n\n- CVE-2020-1725: A flaw was found in keycloak before version 13.0.0.

Due to an incorrect authorization check in the affected component, an attacker could extract information about access protected PLC program variables over port 102/tcp from an affected device when reading multiple attributes at once.\n\n- CVE-2020-28872: An authorization bypass vulnerability in Monitorr v1.7.6m in Monitorr/assets/config/_installation/_register.php allows an unauthorized person to create valid credentials.\n\n- CVE-2020-29605: An issue was discovered in MantisBT before 2.24.4. Due to insufficient access-level checks, any logged-in user allowed to perform Group Actions can get access to the Summary fields of private Issues via bug_arr[]= in a crafted bug_actiongroup_page.php URL. (The target Issues can have Private view status, or belong to a private Project.)\n\n- CVE-2021-1144: A vulnerability in Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) could allow a remote, authenticated attacker without administrative privileges to alter the password of any user on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of authorization checks for changing a password. An authenticated attacker without administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability by sending a modified HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the passwords of any user on the system, including an administrative user, and then impersonate that user.\n\n- CVE-2021-1539: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-1540: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-20179: A flaw was found in pki-core. An attacker who has successfully compromised a key could use this flaw to renew the corresponding certificate over and over again, as long as it is not explicitly revoked. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-20188: A flaw was found in podman before 1.7.0. File permissions for non-root users running in a privileged container are not correctly checked. This flaw can be abused by a low-privileged user inside the container to access any other file in the container, even if owned by the root user inside the container. It does not allow to directly escape the container, though being a privileged container means that a lot of security features are disabled when running the container. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-20229: A flaw was found in PostgreSQL in versions before 13.2. This flaw allows a user with SELECT privilege on one column to craft a special query that returns all columns of the table. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20282: When creating a user account, it was possible to verify the account without having access to the verification email link/secret in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2021-21182: Insufficient policy enforcement in navigations in Google Chrome prior to 89.0.4389.72 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-21228: Insufficient policy enforcement in extensions in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.93 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted Chrome Extension.\n\n- CVE-2021-21318: Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of educational audio and video content. In Opencast before version 9.2 there is a vulnerability in which publishing an episode with strict access rules will overwrite the currently set series access. This allows for an easy denial of access for all users without superuser privileges, effectively hiding the series. Access to series and series metadata on the search service (shown in media module and player) depends on the events published which are part of the series. Publishing an event will automatically publish a series and update access to it. Removing an event or republishing the event should do the same. Affected versions of Opencast may not update the series access or remove a published series if an event is being removed. On removal of an episode, this may lead to an access control list for series metadata with broader access rules than the merged access rules of all remaining events, or the series metadata still being available although all episodes of that series have been removed. This problem is fixed in Opencast 9.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-21367: Switchboard Bluetooth Plug for elementary OS from version 2.3.0 and before version version 2.3.5 has an incorrect authorization vulnerability. When the Bluetooth plug is running (in discoverable mode), Bluetooth service requests and pairing requests are automatically accepted, allowing physically proximate attackers to pair with a device running an affected version of switchboard-plug-bluetooth without the active consent of the user. By default, elementary OS doesn't expose any services via Bluetooth that allow information to be extracted by paired Bluetooth devices. However, if such services (i.e. contact list sharing software) have been installed, it's possible that attackers have been able to extract data from such services without authorization. If no such services have been installed, attackers are only able to pair with a device running an affected version without authorization and then play audio out of the device or possibly present a HID device (keyboard, mouse, etc...) to control the device. As such, users should check the list of trusted/paired devices and remove any that are not 100% confirmed to be genuine. This is fixed in version 2.3.5. To reduce the likelihood of this vulnerability on an unpatched version, only open the Bluetooth plug for short intervals when absolutely necessary and preferably not in crowded public areas. To mitigate the risk entirely with unpatched versions, do not open the Bluetooth plug within switchboard at all, and use a different method for pairing devices if necessary (e.g. `bluetoothctl` CLI).\n\n- CVE-2021-21389: BuddyPress is an open source WordPress plugin to build a community site. In releases of BuddyPress from 5.0.0 before 7.2.1 it's possible for a non-privileged, regular user to obtain administrator rights by exploiting an issue in the REST API members endpoint. The vulnerability has been fixed in BuddyPress 7.2.1. Existing installations of the plugin should be updated to this version to mitigate the issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-21411: OAuth2-Proxy is an open source reverse proxy that provides authentication with Google, Github or other providers. The `--gitlab-group` flag for group-based authorization in the GitLab provider stopped working in the v7.0.0 release. Regardless of the flag settings, authorization wasn't restricted. Additionally, any authenticated users had whichever groups were set in `--gitlab-group` added to the new `X-Forwarded-Groups` header to the upstream application. While adding GitLab project based authorization support in #630, a bug was introduced where the user session's groups field was populated with the `--gitlab-group` config entries instead of pulling the individual user's group membership from the GitLab Userinfo endpoint. When the session groups where compared against the allowed groups for authorization, they matched improperly (since both lists were populated with the same data) so authorization was allowed. This impacts GitLab Provider users who relies on group membership for authorization restrictions. Any authenticated users in your GitLab environment can access your applications regardless of `--gitlab-group` membership restrictions. This is patched in v7.1.0. There is no workaround for the Group membership bug. But `--gitlab-project` can be set to use Project membership as the authorization checks instead of groups; it is not broken.\n\n- CVE-2021-21609: Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not correctly match requested URLs to the list of always accessible paths, allowing attackers without Overall/Read permission to access some URLs as if they did have Overall/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21643: Jenkins Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints, allowing attackers with global Job/Configure permission to enumerate system-scoped credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\n- CVE-2021-21670: Jenkins 2.299 and earlier, LTS 2.289.1 and earlier allows users to cancel queue items and abort builds of jobs for which they have Item/Cancel permission even when they do not have Item/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21692: FilePath#renameTo and FilePath#moveAllChildrenTo in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier only check 'read' agent-to-controller access permission on the source path, instead of 'delete'.\n\n- CVE-2021-22251: Improper validation of invited users' email address in GitLab EE affecting all versions since 12.2 allowed projects to add members with email address domain that should be blocked by group settings\n\n- CVE-2021-22389: There is a Permission Control Vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause certain codes to be executed.\n\n- CVE-2021-24244: An AJAX action registered by the WPBakery Page Builder (Visual Composer) Clipboard WordPress plugin before 4.5.8 did not have capability checks, allowing low privilege users, such as subscribers, to update the license options (key, email).\n\n- CVE-2021-24278: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, unauthenticated users can use the wpcf7r_get_nonce AJAX action to retrieve a valid nonce for any WordPress action/function.\n\n- CVE-2021-24279: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, low level users, such as subscribers, could use the import_from_debug AJAX action to install any plugin from the WordPress repository.\n\n- CVE-2021-24281: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the delete_action_post AJAX action to delete any post on a target site.\n\n- CVE-2021-24282: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the various AJAX actions in the plugin to do a variety of things. For example, an attacker could use wpcf7r_reset_settings to reset the plugin\u2019s settings, wpcf7r_add_action to add actions to a form, and more.\n\n- CVE-2021-24379: The Comments Like Dislike WordPress plugin before 1.1.4 allows users to like/dislike posted comments, however does not prevent them from replaying the AJAX request to add a like. This allows any user (even unauthenticated) to add unlimited like/dislike to any comment. The plugin appears to have some Restriction modes, such as Cookie Restriction, IP Restrictions, Logged In User Restriction, however, they do not prevent such attack as they only check client side\n\n- CVE-2021-24652: The PostX \u2013 Gutenberg Blocks for Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.4.10 performs incorrect checks before allowing any logged in user to perform some ajax based requests, allowing any user to modify, delete or add ultp_options values.\n\n- CVE-2021-24717: The AutomatorWP WordPress plugin before 1.7.6 does not perform capability checks which allows users with Subscriber roles to enumerate automations, disclose title of private posts or user emails, call functions, or perform privilege escalation via Ajax actions.\n\n- CVE-2021-24742: The Logo Slider and Showcase WordPress plugin before 1.3.37 allows Editor users to update the plugin's settings via the rtWLSSettings AJAX action because it uses a nonce for authorisation instead of a capability check.\n\n- CVE-2021-24757: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.0 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users), which could allow unauthenticated users to upload images.\n\n- CVE-2021-24770: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.1 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to authenticated users), which could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber, to upload arbitrary images.\n\n- CVE-2021-25777: In JetBrains TeamCity before 2020.2.1, permissions during token removal were checked improperly.\n\n- CVE-2021-25954: In \u201cDolibarr\u201d application, 2.8.1 to 13.0.4 don\u2019t restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor. A low privileged attacker can modify the Private Note which only an administrator has rights to do, the affected field is at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint.\n\n- CVE-2021-26040: An issue was discovered in Joomla! 4.0.0. The media manager does not correctly check the user's permissions before executing a file deletion command.\n\n- CVE-2021-26563: Incorrect authorization vulnerability in synoagentregisterd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.4-25553 allows local users to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2021-28661: Default SilverStripe GraphQL Server (aka silverstripe/graphql) 3.x through 3.4.1 permission checker not inherited by query subclass.\n\n- CVE-2021-28696: IOMMU page mapping issues on x86 T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Both AMD and Intel allow ACPI tables to specify regions of memory which should be left untranslated, which typically means these addresses should pass the translation phase unaltered. While these are typically device specific ACPI properties, they can also be specified to apply to a range of devices, or even all devices. On all systems with such regions Xen failed to prevent guests from undoing/replacing such mappings (CVE-2021-28694). On AMD systems, where a discontinuous range is specified by firmware, the supposedly-excluded middle range will also be identity-mapped (CVE-2021-28695). Further, on AMD systems, upon de-assigment of a physical device from a guest, the identity mappings would be left in place, allowing a guest continued access to ranges of memory which it shouldn't have access to anymore (CVE-2021-28696).\n\n- CVE-2021-29439: The Grav admin plugin prior to version 1.10.11 does not correctly verify caller's privileges. As a consequence, users with the permission `admin.login` can install third-party plugins and their dependencies. By installing the right plugin, an attacker can obtain an arbitrary code execution primitive and elevate their privileges on the instance. The vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.10.11. As a mitigation blocking access to the `/admin` path from untrusted sources will reduce the probability of exploitation. \n\n- CVE-2021-29943: When using ConfigurableInternodeAuthHadoopPlugin for authentication, Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2 would forward/proxy distributed requests using server credentials instead of original client credentials. This would result in incorrect authorization resolution on the receiving hosts.\n\n- CVE-2021-30533: Insufficient policy enforcement in PopupBlocker in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted iframe.\n\n- CVE-2021-30534: Insufficient policy enforcement in iFrameSandbox in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31158: In the Query Engine in Couchbase Server 6.5.x and 6.6.x through 6.6.1, Common Table Expression queries were not correctly checking the user's permissions, allowing read-access to resources beyond what those users were explicitly allowed to access.\n\n- CVE-2021-31926: AMP Application Deployment Service in CubeCoders AMP 2.1.x before 2.1.1.2 allows a remote, authenticated user to open ports in the local system firewall by crafting an HTTP(S) request directly to the applicable API endpoint (despite not having permission to make changes to the system's network configuration).\n\n- CVE-2021-33718: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 7 (All versions < V7.23.22), Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.7), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.3.0). Write access checks of attributes of an object could be bypassed, if user has a write permissions to the first attribute of this object.\n\n- CVE-2021-34434: In Eclipse Mosquitto versions 2.0 to 2.0.11, when using the dynamic security plugin, if the ability for a client to make subscriptions on a topic is revoked when a durable client is offline, then existing subscriptions for that client are not revoked.\n\n- CVE-2021-35949: The shareinfo controller in the ownCloud Server before 10.8.0 allows an attacker to bypass the permission checks for upload only shares and list metadata about the share.\n\n- CVE-2021-36132: An issue was discovered in the FileImporter extension in MediaWiki through 1.36. For certain relaxed configurations of the $wgFileImporterRequiredRight variable, it might not validate all appropriate user rights, thus allowing a user with insufficient rights to perform operations (specifically file uploads) that they should not be allowed to perform.\n\n- CVE-2021-36230: HashiCorp Terraform Enterprise releases up to v202106-1 did not properly perform authorization checks on a subset of API requests executed using the run token, allowing privilege escalation to organization owner. Fixed in v202107-1.\n\n- CVE-2021-38312: The Gutenberg Template Library & Redux Framework plugin <= 4.2.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check in the REST API endpoints registered under the \u201credux/v1/templates/\u201d REST Route in \u201credux-templates/classes/class-api.php\u201d. The `permissions_callback` used in this file only checked for the `edit_posts` capability which is granted to lower-privileged users such as contributors, allowing such users to install arbitrary plugins from the WordPress repository and edit arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-38345: The Brizy Page Builder plugin <= 2.3.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check that allowed any logged-in user accessing any endpoint in the wp-admin directory to modify the content of any existing post or page created with the Brizy editor. An identical issue was found by another researcher in Brizy <= 1.0.125 and fixed in version 1.0.126, but the vulnerability was reintroduced in version 1.0.127.\n\n- CVE-2021-39321: Version 3.3.23 of the Sassy Social Share WordPress plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection via the wp_ajax_heateor_sss_import_config AJAX action due to deserialization of unvalidated user supplied inputs via the import_config function found in the ~/admin/class-sassy-social-share-admin.php file. This can be exploited by underprivileged authenticated users due to a missing capability check on the import_config function.\n\n- CVE-2021-39902: Incorrect Authorization in GitLab CE/EE 13.4 or above allows a user with guest membership in a project to modify the severity of an incident.\n\n- CVE-2021-41082: Discourse is a platform for community discussion. In affected versions any private message that includes a group had its title and participating user exposed to users that do not have access to the private messages. However, access control for the private messages was not compromised as users were not able to view the posts in the leaked private message despite seeing it in their inbox. The problematic commit was reverted around 32 minutes after it was made. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest commit if they are running Discourse against the `tests-passed` branch.\n\n- CVE-2021-41189: DSpace is an open source turnkey repository application. In version 7.0, any community or collection administrator can escalate their permission up to become system administrator. This vulnerability only exists in 7.0 and does not impact 6.x or below. This issue is patched in version 7.1. As a workaround, users of 7.0 may temporarily disable the ability for community or collection administrators to manage permissions or workflows settings.\n\n- CVE-2021-41230: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. In affected versions changes to the OIDC claims of a user after initial login are not reflected in policy evaluation when using `allowed_idp_claims` as part of policy. If using `allowed_idp_claims` and a user's claims are changed, Pomerium can make incorrect authorization decisions. This issue has been resolved in v0.15.6. For users unable to upgrade clear data on `databroker` service by clearing redis or restarting the in-memory databroker to force claims to be updated.\n\n- CVE-2021-42025: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control write access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to manipulate the content of System.FileDocument objects in some cases, regardless whether they have write access to it.\n\n- CVE-2021-42026: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control read access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to retrieve the changedDate attribute of arbitrary objects, even when they don't have read access to them.\n\n- CVE-2021-43553: PI Vision could disclose information to a user with insufficient privileges for an AF attribute that is the child of another attribute and is configured as a Limits property.\n\n- CVE-2021-29959: When a user has already allowed a website to access microphone and camera, disabling camera sharing would not fully prevent the website from re-enabling it without an additional prompt. This was only possible if the website kept recording with the microphone until re-enabling the camera. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.\n\n- CVE-2021-32701: ORY Oathkeeper is an Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) and Access Control Decision API that authorizes HTTP requests based on sets of Access Rules. When you make a request to an endpoint that requires the scope `foo` using an access token granted with that `foo` scope, introspection will be valid and that token will be cached. The problem comes when a second requests to an endpoint that requires the scope `bar` is made before the cache has expired. Whether the token is granted or not to the `bar` scope, introspection will be valid. A patch will be released with `v0.38.12-beta.1`. Per default, caching is disabled for the `oauth2_introspection` authenticator. When caching is disabled, this vulnerability does not exist. The cache is checked in [`func (a *AuthenticatorOAuth2Introspection) Authenticate(...)`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L152). From [`tokenFromCache()`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L97) it seems that it only validates the token expiration date, but ignores whether the token has or not the proper scopes. The vulnerability was introduced in PR #424. During review, we failed to require appropriate test coverage by the submitter which is the primary reason that the vulnerability passed the review process.\n\n- CVE-2021-20538: IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S) 1.5.0.0 and 1.5.0.1 could allow a user to obtain sensitive information or perform actions they should not have access to due to incorrect authorization mechanisms. IBM X-Force ID: 198919.\n\n- CVE-2021-40504: A certain template role in SAP NetWeaver Application Server for ABAP and ABAP Platform - versions 700, 701, 702, 710, 711, 730, 731, 740, 750, 751, 752, 753, 754, 755, 756, contains transport authorizations, which exceed expected display only permissions.\n\n- CVE-2021-25356: An improper caller check vulnerability in Managed Provisioning prior to SMR APR-2021 Release 1 allows unprivileged application to install arbitrary application, grant device admin permission and then delete several installed application.\n\n- CVE-2021-24783: The Post Expirator WordPress plugin before 2.6.0 does not have proper capability checks in place, which could allow users with a role as low as Contributor to schedule deletion of arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-26753: NeDi 1.9C allows an authenticated user to inject PHP code in the System Files function on the endpoint /System-Files.php via the txt HTTP POST parameter. This allows an attacker to obtain access to the operating system where NeDi is installed and to all application data.\n\n- CVE-2021-32829: ZStack is open source IaaS(infrastructure as a service) software aiming to automate datacenters, managing resources of compute, storage, and networking all by APIs. Affected versions of ZStack REST API are vulnerable to post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) via bypass of the Groovy shell sandbox. The REST API exposes the GET zstack/v1/batch-queries?script endpoint which is backed up by the BatchQueryAction class. Messages are represented by the APIBatchQueryMsg, dispatched to the QueryFacadeImpl facade and handled by the BatchQuery class. The HTTP request parameter script is mapped to the APIBatchQueryMsg.script property and evaluated as a Groovy script in BatchQuery.query the evaluation of the user-controlled Groovy script is sandboxed by SandboxTransformer which will apply the restrictions defined in the registered (sandbox.register()) GroovyInterceptor. Even though the sandbox heavily restricts the receiver types to a small set of allowed types, the sandbox is non effective at controlling any code placed in Java annotations and therefore vulnerable to meta-programming escapes. This issue leads to post-authenticated remote code execution. For more details see the referenced GHSL-2021-065. This issue is patched in versions 3.8.21, 3.10.8, and 4.1.0.\n\n- CVE-2020-9381: controllers/admin.js in Total.js CMS 13 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a POST to the /admin/api/widgets/ URI. This can be exploited in conjunction with CVE-2019-15954.\n\n- CVE-2021-26027: An issue was discovered in Joomla! 3.0.0 through 3.9.24. Incorrect ACL checks could allow unauthorized change of the category for an article.\n\n- CVE-2021-36749: In the Druid ingestion system, the InputSource is used for reading data from a certain data source. However, the HTTP InputSource allows authenticated users to read data from other sources than intended, such as the local file system, with the privileges of the Druid server process. This is not an elevation of privilege when users access Druid directly, since Druid also provides the Local InputSource, which allows the same level of access. But it is problematic when users interact with Druid indirectly through an application that allows users to specify the HTTP InputSource, but not the Local InputSource. In this case, users could bypass the application-level restriction by passing a file URL to the HTTP InputSource. This issue was previously mentioned as being fixed in 0.21.0 as per CVE-2021-26920 but was not fixed in 0.21.0 or 0.21.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-43560: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.3, 3.10 to 3.10.7, 3.9 to 3.9.10 and earlier unsupported versions. Insufficient capability checks made it possible to fetch other users' calendar action events.\n\n- CVE-2021-31548: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. A MediaWiki user who is partially blocked or was unsuccessfully blocked could bypass AbuseFilter and have their edits completed.\n\n- CVE-2021-31552: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. It incorrectly executed certain rules related to blocking accounts after account creation. Such rules would allow for user accounts to be created while blocking only the IP address used to create an account (and not the user account itself). Such rules could also be used by a nefarious, unprivileged user to catalog and enumerate any number of IP addresses related to these account creations.\n\n- CVE-2021-31554: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. It improperly handled account blocks for certain automatically created MediaWiki user accounts, thus allowing nefarious users to remain unblocked.\n\n- CVE-2021-35197: In MediaWiki before 1.31.15, 1.32.x through 1.35.x before 1.35.3, and 1.36.x before 1.36.1, bots have certain unintended API access.

In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the name, avatar, topic and number of members of a room if they know the ID of the room. This vulnerability is limited to homeservers where the vulnerable homeserver is in the room and untrusted users are permitted to create groups (communities). By default, only homeserver administrators can create groups. However, homeserver administrators can already access this information in the database or using the admin API. As a result, only homeservers where the configuration setting `enable_group_creation` has been set to `true` are impacted. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or higher to patch the vulnerability. There are two potential workarounds. Server administrators can set `enable_group_creation` to `false` in their homeserver configuration (this is the default value) to prevent creation of groups by non-administrators. Administrators that are using a reverse proxy could, with partial loss of group functionality, block the endpoints `/_matrix/client/r0/groups/{group_id}/rooms` and `/_matrix/client/unstable/groups/{group_id}/rooms`.\n\n- CVE-2021-39164: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP.

The vulnerability is limited to rooms with `shared` history visibility. Furthermore, the unauthorised user must be using an account on a vulnerable homeserver that is in the room. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or later in order to receive the patch. One workaround is available. Administrators of servers that use a reverse proxy could, with potentially unacceptable loss of functionality, block the endpoints: `/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter, and `/_matrix/client/unstable/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-0472: In shouldLockKeyguard of LockTaskController.java, there is a possible way to exit App Pinning without a PIN due to a permissions bypass.

This allows an attacker to permanently disable all monitoring checks.\n\n- CVE-2022-34782: An incorrect permission check in Jenkins requests-plugin Plugin 2.2.16 and earlier allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to view the list of pending requests.\n\n- CVE-2022-3819: An improper authorization issue in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 15.0 prior to 15.3.5, 15.4 prior to 15.4.4, and 15.5 prior to 15.5.2 allows a malicious users to set emojis on internal notes they don't have access to.\n\n- CVE-2022-40816: Zammad 5.2.1 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control. Zammad's asset handling mechanism has logic to ensure that customer users are not able to see personal information of other users. This logic was not effective when used through a web socket connection, so that a logged-in attacker would be able to fetch personal data of other users by querying the Zammad API. This issue is fixed in , 5.2.2.\n\n- CVE-2022-45383: An incorrect permission check in Jenkins Support Core Plugin 1206.v14049fa_b_d860 and earlier allows attackers with Support/DownloadBundle permission to download a previously created support bundle containing information limited to users with Overall/Administer permission.\n\n- CVE-2022-46076: D-Link DIR-869 DIR869Ax_FW102B15 is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass via phpcgi.\n\n- CVE-2021-24917: The WPS Hide Login WordPress plugin before 1.9.1 has a bug which allows to get the secret login page by setting a random referer string and making a request to /wp-admin/options.php as an unauthenticated user.\n\n- CVE-2022-1746: The authentication mechanism used by poll workers to administer voting using the tested version of Dominion Voting Systems ImageCast X can expose cryptographic secrets used to protect election information. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to gain access to sensitive information and perform privileged actions, potentially affecting other election equipment.\n\n- CVE-2022-22967: An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt in versions before 3002.9, 3003.5, 3004.2. PAM auth fails to reject locked accounts, which allows a previously authorized user whose account is locked still run Salt commands when their account is locked. This affects both local shell accounts with an active session and salt-api users that authenticate via PAM eauth.\n\n- CVE-2022-23822: In this physical attack, an attacker may potentially exploit the Zynq-7000 SoC First Stage Boot Loader (FSBL) by bypassing authentication and loading a malicious image onto the device. This in turn may further allow the attacker to perform additional attacks such as such as using the device as a decryption oracle. An anticipated mitigation via a 2022.1 patch will resolve the issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-24778: The imgcrypt library provides API exensions for containerd to support encrypted container images and implements the ctd-decoder command line tool for use by containerd to decrypt encrypted container images. The imgcrypt function `CheckAuthorization` is supposed to check whether the current used is authorized to access an encrypted image and prevent the user from running an image that another user previously decrypted on the same system. In versions prior to 1.1.4, a failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. Only the first architecture in the list was tested, which may not have its layers available locally since it could not be run on the host architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However, this verdict to allow the image to run enabled other architectures in the ManifestList to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted. A patch has been applied to imgcrypt 1.1.4. Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.\n\n- CVE-2022-33174: Power Distribution Units running on Powertek firmware (multiple brands) before 3.30.30 allows remote authorization bypass in the web interface. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must send an HTTP packet to the data retrieval interface (/cgi/get_param.cgi) with the tmpToken cookie set to an empty string followed by a semicolon. This bypasses an active session authorization check. This can be then used to fetch the values of protected sys.passwd and sys.su.name fields that contain the username and password in cleartext.\n\n- CVE-2021-22240: Improper access control in GitLab EE versions 13.11.6, 13.12.6, and 14.0.2 allows users to be created via single sign on despite user cap being enabled\n\n- CVE-2021-35112: A user with user level permission can access graphics protected region due to improper access control in register configuration in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-37409: Improper access control for some Intel(R) PROSet/Wireless WiFi and Killer(TM) WiFi products may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\n\n- CVE-2022-0574: Improper Access Control in GitHub repository publify/publify prior to 9.2.8.\n\n- CVE-2022-1944: When the feature is configured, improper authorization in the Interactive Web Terminal in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 11.3 prior to 14.9.5, 14.10 prior to 14.10.4, and 15.0 prior to 15.0.1 allows users with the Developer role to open terminals on other Developers' running jobs\n\n- CVE-2022-2095: An improper access control check in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 13.7 before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1 allows a malicious authenticated user to view a public project's Deploy Key's public fingerprint and name when that key has write permission. Note that GitLab never asks for nor stores the private key.\n\n- CVE-2022-23488: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4-rc-6 are vulnerable to Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data. The moderators-only webcams lock setting is not enforced on the backend, which allows an attacker to subscribe to viewers' webcams, even when the lock setting is applied. (The required streamId was being sent to all users even with lock setting applied). This issue is fixed in version 2.4-rc-6. There are no workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-0406: Improper Authorization in GitHub repository janeczku/calibre-web prior to 0.6.16.\n\n- CVE-2022-35921: fof/byobu is a private discussions extension for Flarum forum. Affected versions were found to not respect private discussion disablement by users. Users of Byobu should update the extension to version 1.1.7, where this has been patched. Users of Byobu with Flarum 1.0 or 1.1 should upgrade to Flarum 1.2 or later, or evaluate the impact this issue has on your forum's users and choose to disable the extension if needed. There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-41923: Grails Spring Security Core plugin is vulnerable to privilege escalation. The vulnerability allows an attacker access to one endpoint (i.e. the targeted endpoint) using the authorization requirements of a different endpoint (i.e. the donor endpoint). In some Grails framework applications, access to the targeted endpoint will be granted based on meeting the authorization requirements of the donor endpoint, which can result in a privilege escalation attack. This vulnerability has been patched in grails-spring-security-core versions 3.3.2, 4.0.5 and 5.1.1. Impacted Applications: Grails Spring Security Core plugin versions: 1.x 2.x >=3.0.0 <3.3.2 >=4.0.0 <4.0.5 >=5.0.0 <5.1.1 We strongly suggest that all Grails framework applications using the Grails Spring Security Core plugin be updated to a patched release of the plugin. Workarounds: Users should create a subclass extending one of the following classes from the `grails.plugin.springsecurity.web.access.intercept` package, depending on their security configuration: * `AnnotationFilterInvocationDefinition` * `InterceptUrlMapFilterInvocationDefinition` * `RequestmapFilterInvocationDefinition` In each case, the subclass should override the `calculateUri` method like so: ``` @Override protected String calculateUri(HttpServletRequest request) { UrlPathHelper.defaultInstance.getRequestUri(request) } ``` This should be considered a temporary measure, as the patched versions of grails-spring-security-core deprecates the `calculateUri` method. Once upgraded to a patched version of the plugin, this workaround is no longer needed. The workaround is especially important for version 2.x, as no patch is available version 2.x of the GSSC plugin.\n\n- CVE-2022-0580: Incorrect Authorization in Packagist librenms/librenms prior to 22.2.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-1223: Incorrect Authorization in GitHub repository phpipam/phpipam prior to 1.4.6. \n\n- CVE-2022-0117: Policy bypass in Blink in Google Chrome prior to 97.0.4692.71 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-0334: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions.

There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-24783: Deno is a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. The versions of Deno between release 1.18.0 and 1.20.2 (inclusive) are vulnerable to an attack where a malicious actor controlling the code executed in a Deno runtime could bypass all permission checks and execute arbitrary shell code. This vulnerability does not affect users of Deno Deploy. The vulnerability has been patched in Deno 1.20.3. There is no workaround. All users are recommended to upgrade to 1.20.3 immediately.\n\n- CVE-2022-25318: An issue was discovered in Cerebrate through 1.4. An incorrect sharing group ACL allowed an unprivileged user to edit and modify sharing groups.\n\n- CVE-2022-27575: Information exposure vulnerability in One UI Home prior to SMR April-2022 Release 1 allows to access currently launched foreground app information without permission.\n\n- CVE-2022-35716: IBM UrbanCode Deploy (UCD) 6.2.0.0 through 6.2.7.16, 7.0.0.0 through 7.0.5.11, 7.1.0.0 through 7.1.2.7, and 7.2.0.0 through 7.2.3.0 could allow an authenticated user to obtain sensitive information in some instances due to improper security checking. IBM X-Force ID: 231360.\n\n- CVE-2022-2408: The Guest account feature in Mattermost version 6.7.0 and earlier fails to properly restrict the permissions, which allows a guest user to fetch a list of all public channels in the team, in spite of not being part of those channels.\n\n- CVE-2022-0985: Insufficient capability checks could allow users with the moodle/site:uploadusers capability to delete users, without having the necessary moodle/user:delete capability.\n\n- CVE-2022-1460: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 9.2 before 14.8.6, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.4, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.1. GitLab was not performing correct authorizations on scheduled pipelines allowing a malicious user to run a pipeline in the context of another user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24748: Shopware is an open commerce platform based on the Symfony php Framework and the Vue javascript framework. In versions prior to 6.4.8.2 it is possible to modify customers and to create orders without App Permission. This issue is a result of improper api route checking. Users are advised to upgrade to version 6.4.8.2. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-25335: RigoBlock Dragos through 2022-02-17 lacks the onlyOwner modifier for setMultipleAllowances. This enables token manipulation, as exploited in the wild in February 2022. NOTE: although 2022-02-17 is the vendor's vulnerability announcement date, the vulnerability will not be remediated until a major protocol upgrade occurs.\n\n- CVE-2022-36103: Talos Linux is a Linux distribution built for Kubernetes deployments. Talos worker nodes use a join token to get accepted into the Talos cluster. Due to improper validation of the request while signing a worker node CSR (certificate signing request) Talos control plane node might issue Talos API certificate which allows full access to Talos API on a control plane node. Accessing Talos API with full level access on a control plane node might reveal sensitive information which allows full level access to the cluster (Kubernetes and Talos PKI, etc.). Talos API join token is stored in the machine configuration on the worker node. When configured correctly, Kubernetes workloads don't have access to the machine configuration, but due to a misconfiguration workload might access the machine configuration and reveal the join token. This problem has been fixed in Talos 1.2.2. Enabling the Pod Security Standards mitigates the vulnerability by denying hostPath mounts and host networking by default in the baseline policy. Clusters that don't run untrusted workloads are not affected. Clusters with correct Pod Security configurations which don't allow hostPath mounts, and secure access to cloud metadata server (or machine configuration is not supplied via cloud metadata server) are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-46792: Hasura GraphQL Engine before 2.15.2 mishandles row-level authorization in the Update Many API for Postgres backends. The fixed versions are 2.10.2, 2.11.3, 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.1, and 2.15.2. (Versions before 2.10.0 are unaffected.)\n\n- CVE-2022-3048: Inappropriate implementation in Chrome OS lockscreen in Google Chrome on Chrome OS prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a local attacker to bypass lockscreen navigation restrictions via physical access to the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-30538: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-30539: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31876: Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 through 0.21.1 does not properly implement the replacement policy specified in BIP125, which makes it easier for attackers to trigger a loss of funds, or a denial of service attack against downstream projects such as Lightning network nodes. An unconfirmed child transaction with nSequence = 0xff_ff_ff_ff, spending an unconfirmed parent with nSequence <= 0xff_ff_ff_fd, should be replaceable because there is inherited signaling by the child transaction. However, the actual PreChecks implementation does not enforce this. Instead, mempool rejects the replacement attempt of the unconfirmed child transaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-3763: A flaw was found in the Red Hat AMQ Broker management console in version 7.8 where an existing user is able to access some limited information even when the role the user is assigned to should not be allow access to the management console. The main impact is to confidentiality as this flaw means some role bindings are incorrectly checked, some privileged meta information such as queue names and configuration details are disclosed but the impact is limited as not all information is accessible and there is no affect to integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-39206: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, contains two authorization related vulnerabilities CVE-2021-32777 and CVE-2021-32779. This may lead to incorrect routing or authorization policy decisions. With specially crafted requests, incorrect authorization or routing decisions may be made by Pomerium. Pomerium v0.14.8 and v0.15.1 contain an upgraded envoy binary with these vulnerabilities patched. This issue can only be triggered when using path prefix based policy. Removing any such policies should provide mitigation.\n\n- CVE-2022-0333: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions. The calendar:manageentries capability allowed managers to access or modify any calendar event, but should have been restricted from accessing user level events.\n\n- CVE-2022-0633: The UpdraftPlus WordPress plugin Free before 1.22.3 and Premium before 2.22.3 do not properly validate a user has the required privileges to access a backup's nonce identifier, which may allow any users with an account on the site (such as subscriber) to download the most recent site & database backup.\n\n- CVE-2022-0740: Incorrect authorization in the Asana integration's branch restriction feature in all versions of GitLab CE/EE starting from version 7.8.0 before 14.7.7, all versions starting from 14.8 before 14.8.5, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.2 makes it possible to close Asana tasks from unrestricted branches.\n\n- CVE-2022-0825: The Amelia WordPress plugin before 1.0.49 does not have proper authorisation when managing appointments, allowing any customer to update other's booking status, as well as retrieve sensitive information about the bookings, such as the full name and phone number of the person who booked it.\n\n- CVE-2022-1935: Incorrect authorization in GitLab EE affecting all versions from 12.0 before 14.9.5, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.4, all versions starting from 15.0 before 15.0.1 allowed an attacker already in possession of a valid Project Trigger Token to misuse it from any location even when IP address restrictions were configured\n\n- CVE-2022-1936: Incorrect authorization in GitLab EE affecting all versions from 12.0 before 14.9.5, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.4, all versions starting from 15.0 before 15.0.1 allowed an attacker already in possession of a valid Project Deploy Token to misuse it from any location even when IP address restrictions were configured\n\n- CVE-2022-1981: An issue has been discovered in GitLab EE affecting all versions starting from 12.2 prior to 14.10.5, 15.0 prior to 15.0.4, and 15.1 prior to 15.1.1. In GitLab, if a group enables the setting to restrict access to users belonging to specific domains, that allow-list may be bypassed if a Maintainer uses the 'Invite a group' feature to invite a group that has members that don't comply with domain allow-list.\n\n- CVE-2022-21701: Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. In versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 Istio is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. Users who have `CREATE` permission for `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` objects can escalate this privilege to create other resources that they may not have access to, such as `Pod`. This vulnerability impacts only an Alpha level feature, the Kubernetes Gateway API. This is not the same as the Istio Gateway type (gateways.networking.istio.io), which is not vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade should implement any of the following which will prevent this vulnerability: Remove the gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io CustomResourceDefinition, set PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER=true environment variable in Istiod, or remove CREATE permissions for gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io objects from untrusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-22326: IBM Datapower Gateway 10.0.2.0 through 10.0.4.0, 10.0.1.0 through 10.0.1.5, and 2018.4.1.0 through 2018.4.1.18 could allow unauthorized viewing of logs and files due to insufficient authorization checks. IBM X-Force ID: 218856.\n\n- CVE-2022-23490: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4.0 expose sensitive information to Unauthorized Actors. This issue affects meetings with polls, where the attacker is a meeting participant. Subscribing to the current-poll collection does not update the client UI, but does give the attacker access to the contents of the collection, which include the individual poll responses. This issue is patched in version 2.4.0. There are no workarounds. \n\n- CVE-2022-23615: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions any user with SCRIPT right can save a document with the right of the current user which allow accessing API requiring programming right if the current user has programming right. This has been patched in XWiki 13.0. Users are advised to update to resolve this issue. The only known workaround is to limit SCRIPT access.\n\n- CVE-2022-23627: ArchiSteamFarm (ASF) is a C# application with primary purpose of idling Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug in ASF code, introduced in version V5.2.2.2, the program didn't adequately verify effective access of the user sending proxy (i.e. `[Bots]`) commands. In particular, a proxy-like command sent to bot `A` targeting bot `B` has incorrectly verified user's access against bot `A` - instead of bot `B`, to which the command was originally designated. This in result allowed access to resources beyond those configured, being a security threat affecting confidentiality of other bot instances. A successful attack exploiting this bug requires a significant access granted explicitly by original owner of the ASF process prior to that, as attacker has to control at least a single bot in the process to make use of this inadequate access verification loophole. The issue is patched in ASF V5.2.2.5, V5.2.3.2 and future versions. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2022-23739: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server, allowing for escalation of privileges in GraphQL API requests from GitHub Apps. This vulnerability allowed an app installed on an organization to gain access to and modify most organization-level resources that are not tied to a repository regardless of granted permissions, such as users and organization-wide projects. Resources associated with repositories were not impacted, such as repository file content, repository-specific projects, issues, or pull requests. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.7.1 and was fixed in versions 3.3.16, 3.4.11, 3.5.8, 3.6.4, 3.7.1. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.\n\n- CVE-2022-23741: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a scoped user-to-server token to escalate to full admin/owner privileges. An attacker would require an account with admin access to install a malicious GitHub App. This vulnerability was fixed in versions 3.3.17, 3.4.12, 3.5.9, and 3.6.5. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.\n\n- CVE-2022-24307: Mastodon before 3.3.2 and 3.4.x before 3.4.6 has incorrect access control because it does not compact incoming signed JSON-LD activities. (JSON-LD signing has been supported since version 1.6.0.)\n\n- CVE-2022-24714: Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework and command-line interface. Installations of Icinga 2 with the IDO writer enabled are affected. If you use service custom variables in role restrictions, and you regularly decommission service objects, users with said roles may still have access to a collection of content. Note that this only applies if a role has implicitly permitted access to hosts, due to permitted access to at least one of their services. If access to a host is permitted by other means, no sensible information has been disclosed to unauthorized users. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2.\n\n- CVE-2022-24721: CometD is a scalable comet implementation for web messaging. In any version prior to 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6, internal usage of Oort and Seti channels is improperly authorized, so any remote user could subscribe and publish to those channels. By subscribing to those channels, a remote user may be able to watch cluster-internal traffic that contains other users' (possibly sensitive) data. By publishing to those channels, a remote user may be able to create/modify/delete other user's data and modify the cluster structure. A fix is available in versions 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6. As a workaround, install a custom `SecurityPolicy` that forbids subscription and publishing to remote, non-Oort, sessions on Oort and Seti channels.\n\n- CVE-2022-2597: The Visual Portfolio, Photo Gallery & Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.19.0 does not have proper authorisation checks in some of its REST endpoints, allowing users with a role as low as contributor to call them and inject arbitrary CSS in arbitrary saved layouts\n\n- CVE-2022-26767: The issue was addressed with additional permissions checks.

This could result in a user disabling anti-tampering mechanisms which would then allow the user to disable Forcepoint One Endpoint and the protection offered by it.\n\n- CVE-2022-27609: Forcepoint One Endpoint prior to version 22.01 installed on Microsoft Windows does not provide sufficient anti-tampering protection of services by users with Administrator privileges. This could result in a user disabling Forcepoint One Endpoint and the protection offered by it.\n\n- CVE-2022-27668: Depending on the configuration of the route permission table in file 'saprouttab', it is possible for an unauthenticated attacker to execute SAProuter administration commands in SAP NetWeaver and ABAP Platform - versions KERNEL 7.49, 7.77, 7.81, 7.85, 7.86, 7.87, 7.88, KRNL64NUC 7.49, KRNL64UC 7.49, SAP_ROUTER 7.53, 7.22, from a remote client, for example stopping the SAProuter, that could highly impact systems availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-31039: Greenlight is a simple front-end interface for your BigBlueButton server. In affected versions an attacker can view any room's settings even though they are not authorized to do so. Only the room owner and administrator should be able to view a room's settings. This issue has been patched in release version 2.12.6.\n\n- CVE-2022-31107: Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In versions 5.3 until 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10, it is possible for a malicious user who has authorization to log into a Grafana instance via a configured OAuth IdP which provides a login name to take over the account of another user in that Grafana instance. This can occur when the malicious user is authorized to log in to Grafana via OAuth, the malicious user's external user id is not already associated with an account in Grafana, the malicious user's email address is not already associated with an account in Grafana, and the malicious user knows the Grafana username of the target user. If these conditions are met, the malicious user can set their username in the OAuth provider to that of the target user, then go through the OAuth flow to log in to Grafana. Due to the way that external and internal user accounts are linked together during login, if the conditions above are all met then the malicious user will be able to log in to the target user's Grafana account. Versions 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, concerned users can disable OAuth login to their Grafana instance, or ensure that all users authorized to log in via OAuth have a corresponding user account in Grafana linked to their email address.\n\n- CVE-2022-31155: Sourcegraph is an opensource code search and navigation engine. In Sourcegraph versions before 3.41.0, it is possible for an attacker to delete other users\u2019 saved searches due to a bug in the authorization check.

In affected versions of Redis an integer overflow bug in 32-bit Redis version 4.0 or newer could be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. Redis 4.0 or newer uses a configurable limit for the maximum supported bulk input size. By default, it is 512MB which is a safe value for all platforms. If the limit is significantly increased, receiving a large request from a client may trigger several integer overflow scenarios, which would result with buffer overflow and heap corruption. We believe this could in certain conditions be exploited for remote code execution. By default, authenticated Redis users have access to all configuration parameters and can therefore use the \u201cCONFIG SET proto-max-bulk-len\u201d to change the safe default, making the system vulnerable. **This problem only affects 32-bit Redis (on a 32-bit system, or as a 32-bit executable running on a 64-bit system).** The problem is fixed in version 6.2, and the fix is back ported to 6.0.11 and 5.0.11. Make sure you use one of these versions if you are running 32-bit Redis. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent clients from directly executing `CONFIG SET`: Using Redis 6.0 or newer, ACL configuration can be used to block the command. Using older versions, the `rename-command` configuration directive can be used to rename the command to a random string unknown to users, rendering it inaccessible. Please note that this workaround may have an additional impact on users or operational systems that expect `CONFIG SET` to behave in certain ways.\n\n- CVE-2021-21807: An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the DICOM parse_dicom_meta_info functionality of Accusoft ImageGear 19.9.

An integer overflow bug in Redis version 6.0 or newer, could be exploited using the STRALGO LCS command to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. This is a result of an incomplete fix by CVE-2021-29477. The problem is fixed in version 6.2.4 and 6.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to use ACL configuration to prevent clients from using the STRALGO LCS command. On 64 bit systems which have the fixes of CVE-2021-29477 (6.2.3 or 6.0.13), it is sufficient to make sure that the proto-max-bulk-len config parameter is smaller than 2GB (default is 512MB).\n\n- CVE-2021-32628: Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. An integer overflow bug in the ziplist data structure used by all versions of Redis can be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution.

The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16, 5.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from modifying the above configuration parameters. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.\n\n- CVE-2021-34385: Trusty TLK contains a vulnerability in the NVIDIA TLK kernel where an integer overflow in the calculation of a length could lead to a heap overflow.\n\n- CVE-2021-34386: Trusty TLK contains a vulnerability in the NVIDIA TLK kernel where an integer overflow in the calloc size calculation can cause the multiplication of count and size can overflow, which might lead to heap overflows.\n\n- CVE-2021-39254: A crafted NTFS image can cause an integer overflow in memmove, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow in the function ntfs_attr_record_resize, in NTFS-3G < 2021.8.22.\n\n- CVE-2021-40346: An integer overflow exists in HAProxy 2.0 through 2.5 in htx_add_header that can be exploited to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack, allowing an attacker to bypass all configured http-request HAProxy ACLs and possibly other ACLs.\n\n- CVE-2021-41864: prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds write.\n\n- CVE-2021-41991: The in-memory certificate cache in strongSwan before 5.9.4 has a remote integer overflow upon receiving many requests with different certificates to fill the cache and later trigger the replacement of cache entries. The code attempts to select a less-often-used cache entry by means of a random number generator, but this is not done correctly. Remote code execution might be a slight possibility.\n\n- CVE-2021-43784: runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. In runc, netlink is used internally as a serialization system for specifying the relevant container configuration to the `C` portion of the code (responsible for the based namespace setup of containers). In all versions of runc prior to 1.0.3, the encoder did not handle the possibility of an integer overflow in the 16-bit length field for the byte array attribute type, meaning that a large enough malicious byte array attribute could result in the length overflowing and the attribute contents being parsed as netlink messages for container configuration. This vulnerability requires the attacker to have some control over the configuration of the container and would allow the attacker to bypass the namespace restrictions of the container by simply adding their own netlink payload which disables all namespaces. The main users impacted are those who allow untrusted images with untrusted configurations to run on their machines (such as with shared cloud infrastructure). runc version 1.0.3 contains a fix for this bug. As a workaround, one may try disallowing untrusted namespace paths from your container. It should be noted that untrusted namespace paths would allow the attacker to disable namespace protections entirely even in the absence of this bug.\n\n- CVE-2021-36155: LengthPrefixedMessageReader in gRPC Swift 1.1.0 and earlier allocates buffers of arbitrary length, which allows remote attackers to cause uncontrolled resource consumption and deny service.\n\n- CVE-2020-28009: Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow because get_stdinput allows unbounded reads that are accompanied by unbounded increases in a certain size variable.

Depending on the libc used, and the underlying OS capabilities, it could be just a segfault or a heap overwrite. If the libc uses mmap for large chunks, and the OS supports mmap, then it is just a segfault (because the realloc before the integer overflow will use mremap to reduce the size of the chunk, and it will start to write to unmapped memory). However, if using a libc implementation that does not use mmap, or if the OS does not support mmap while using libc, then this could result in a heap overwrite.\n\n- CVE-2022-1923: DOS / potential heap overwrite in mkv demuxing using bzip decompression. Integer overflow in matroskademux element in bzip decompression function which causes a segfault, or could cause a heap overwrite, depending on libc and OS. Depending on the libc used, and the underlying OS capabilities, it could be just a segfault or a heap overwrite. If the libc uses mmap for large chunks, and the OS supports mmap, then it is just a segfault (because the realloc before the integer overflow will use mremap to reduce the size of the chunk, and it will start to write to unmapped memory). However, if using a libc implementation that does not use mmap, or if the OS does not support mmap while using libc, then this could result in a heap overwrite.\n\n- CVE-2022-1924: DOS / potential heap overwrite in mkv demuxing using lzo decompression.

Users are advised to upgrade to a patched version.\n\n- CVE-2022-24310: A CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound vulnerability exists that could cause heap-based buffer overflow, leading to denial of service and potentially remote code execution when an attacker sends multiple specially crafted messages. Affected Product: Interactive Graphical SCADA System Data Server (V15.0.0.22020 and prior)\n\n- CVE-2022-24724: cmark-gfm is GitHub's extended version of the C reference implementation of CommonMark. Prior to versions 0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21, an integer overflow in cmark-gfm's table row parsing `table.c:row_from_string` may lead to heap memory corruption when parsing tables who's marker rows contain more than UINT16_MAX columns. The impact of this heap corruption ranges from Information Leak to Arbitrary Code Execution depending on how and where `cmark-gfm` is used. If `cmark-gfm` is used for rendering remote user controlled markdown, this vulnerability may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in applications employing affected versions of the `cmark-gfm` library. This vulnerability has been patched in the following cmark-gfm versions 0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21. A workaround is available. The vulnerability exists in the table markdown extensions of cmark-gfm. Disabling the table extension will prevent this vulnerability from being triggered.\n\n- CVE-2022-24795: yajl-ruby is a C binding to the YAJL JSON parsing and generation library. The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an integer overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing with large (~2GB) inputs. The reallocation logic at `yajl_buf.c#L64` may result in the `need` 32bit integer wrapping to 0 when `need` approaches a value of 0x80000000 (i.e. ~2GB of data), which results in a reallocation of buf->alloc into a small heap chunk. These integers are declared as `size_t` in the 2.x branch of `yajl`, which practically prevents the issue from triggering on 64bit platforms, however this does not preclude this issue triggering on 32bit builds on which `size_t` is a 32bit integer. Subsequent population of this under-allocated heap chunk is based on the original buffer size, leading to heap memory corruption. This vulnerability mostly impacts process availability. Maintainers believe exploitation for arbitrary code execution is unlikely. A patch is available and anticipated to be part of yajl-ruby version 1.4.2. As a workaround, avoid passing large inputs to YAJL.\n\n- CVE-2022-25291: An integer overflow in WatchGuard Firebox and XTM appliances allows an authenticated remote attacker to trigger a heap-based buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code by initiating a firmware update with a malicious upgrade image.

Versions 7.0.0 and above, prior to 7.0.5 are vulnerable to an Integer Overflow. Executing an `XAUTOCLAIM` command on a stream key in a specific state, with a specially crafted `COUNT` argument may cause an integer overflow, a subsequent heap overflow, and potentially lead to remote code execution. This has been patched in Redis version 7.0.5. No known workarounds exist.\n\n- CVE-2022-39343: Azure RTOS FileX is a FAT-compatible file system that\u2019s fully integrated with Azure RTOS ThreadX. In versions before 6.2.0, the Fault Tolerant feature of Azure RTOS FileX includes integer under and overflows which may be exploited to achieve buffer overflow and modify memory contents. When a valid log file with correct ID and checksum is detected by the `_fx_fault_tolerant_enable` function an attempt to recover the previous failed write operation is taken by call of `_fx_fault_tolerant_apply_logs`. This function iterates through the log entries and performs required recovery operations. When properly crafted a log including entries of type `FX_FAULT_TOLERANT_DIR_LOG_TYPE` may be utilized to introduce unexpected behavior. This issue has been patched in version 6.2.0. A workaround to fix line 218 in fx_fault_tolerant_apply_logs.c is documented in the GHSA.\n\n- CVE-2022-41318: A buffer over-read was discovered in libntlmauth in Squid 2.5 through 5.6.

Due to a bug in ASF code `POST /Api/ASF` ASF API endpoint responsible for updating global ASF config incorrectly removed `IPCPassword` from the resulting config when the caller did not specify it explicitly. Due to the above, it was possible for the user to accidentally remove `IPCPassword` security measure from his IPC interface when updating global ASF config, which exists as part of global config update functionality in ASF-ui. Removal of `IPCPassword` possesses a security risk, as unauthorized users may in result access the IPC interface after such modification. The issue is patched in ASF V5.1.2.4 and future versions. We recommend to manually verify that `IPCPassword` is specified after update, and if not, set it accordingly. In default settings, ASF is configured to allow IPC access from `localhost` only and should not affect majority of users.\n\n- CVE-2021-3282: HashiCorp Vault Enterprise 1.6.0 & 1.6.1 allowed the `remove-peer` raft operator command to be executed against DR secondaries without authentication.

Prior to version 1.10.7, FreeSWITCH does not authenticate SIP MESSAGE requests, leading to spam and message spoofing. By default, SIP requests of the type MESSAGE (RFC 3428) are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. MESSAGE requests are relayed to SIP user agents registered with the FreeSWITCH server without requiring any authentication. Although this behaviour can be changed by setting the `auth-messages` parameter to `true`, it is not the default setting. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to send SIP MESSAGE messages to any SIP user agent that is registered with the server without requiring authentication. Additionally, since no authentication is required, chat messages can be spoofed to appear to come from trusted entities. Therefore, abuse can lead to spam and enable social engineering, phishing and similar attacks. This issue is patched in version 1.10.7. Maintainers recommend that this SIP message type is authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to be explicitly set the `auth-messages` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-38412: Properly formatted POST requests to multiple resources on the HTTP and HTTPS web servers of the Digi PortServer TS 16 Rack device do not require authentication or authentication tokens. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to enable the SNMP service and manipulate the community strings to achieve further control in.\n\n- CVE-2021-41157: FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. By default, SIP requests of the type SUBSCRIBE are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to subscribe to user agent event notifications without the need to authenticate. This abuse poses privacy concerns and might lead to social engineering or similar attacks. For example, attackers may be able to monitor the status of target SIP extensions. Although this issue was fixed in version v1.10.6, installations upgraded to the fixed version of FreeSWITCH from an older version, may still be vulnerable if the configuration is not updated accordingly. Software upgrades do not update the configuration by default. SIP SUBSCRIBE messages should be authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to explicitly set the `auth-subscriptions` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2020-25566: In SapphireIMS 5.0, it is possible to take over an account by sending a request to the Save_Password form as shown in POC. Notice that we do not require a JSESSIONID in this request and can reset any user\u2019s password by changing the username to that user and password to base64(desired password).\n\n- CVE-2021-30167: The manage users profile services of the network camera device allows an authenticated.

Remote attackers can use the vulnerability to view and modify arbitrary content of books without permission.\n\n- CVE-2020-17517: The S3 buckets and keys in a secure Apache Ozone Cluster must be inaccessible to anonymous access by default. The current security vulnerability allows access to keys and buckets through a curl command or an unauthenticated HTTP request. This enables unauthorized access to buckets and keys thereby exposing data to anonymous clients or users. This affected Apache Ozone prior to the 1.1.0 release.\n\n- CVE-2020-4669: IBM Planning Analytics Local 2.0 connects to a MongoDB server. MongoDB, a document-oriented database system, is listening on the remote port, and it is configured to allow connections without password authentication. A remote attacker can gain unauthorized access to the database. IBM X-Force ID: 184600.\n\n- CVE-2021-33924: Confluent Ansible (cp-ansible) version 5.5.0, 5.5.1, 5.5.2 and 6.0.0 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control via its auxiliary component that allows remote attackers to access sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-35936: If remote logging is not used, the worker (in the case of CeleryExecutor) or the scheduler (in the case of LocalExecutor) runs a Flask logging server and is listening on a specific port and also binds on 0.0.0.0 by default.

This often exists in Linux-based code assuming the controlled nature of the root directory (/) or its subdirectories (/etc, etc), or a code that recursively accesses the parent directory. In Windows, the drive root and some of its subdirectories have weak permissions by default, which makes them uncontrolled.\n\n\nIn some Unix-based systems, a PATH might be created that contains an empty element, e.g. by splicing an empty variable into the PATH. This empty element can be interpreted as equivalent to the current working directory, which might be an untrusted search element.\n\n\nIn software package management frameworks (e.g., npm, RubyGems, or PyPi), the framework may identify dependencies on third-party libraries or other packages, then consult a repository that contains the desired package. The framework may search a public repository before a private repository. This could be exploited by attackers by placing a malicious package in the public repository that has the same name as a package from the private repository. The search path might not be directly under control of the developer relying on the framework, but this search order effectively contains an untrusted element.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2023-25815: chain: a change in an underlying package causes the gettext function to use implicit initialization with a hard-coded path (CWE-1419) under the user-writable C:\\ drive, introducing an untrusted search path element (CWE-427) that enables spoofing of messages.\n\n- CVE-2022-4826: Go-based git extension on Windows can search for and execute a malicious \"..exe\" in a repository because Go searches the current working directory if git.exe is not found in the PATH\n\n- CVE-2020-26284: A Static Site Generator built in Go, when running on Windows, searches the current working directory for a command, possibly allowing code execution using a malicious .exe or .bat file with the name being searched\n\n- CVE-2022-24765: Windows-based fork of git creates a \".git\" folder in the C: drive, allowing local attackers to create a .git folder with a malicious config file\n\n- CVE-2019-1552: SSL package searches under \"C:/usr/local\" for configuration files and other critical data, but C:/usr/local might be world-writable.\n\n- CVE-2010-3402: \"DLL hijacking\" issue in document editor.\n\n- CVE-2010-3397: \"DLL hijacking\" issue in encryption software.\n\n- CVE-2010-3138: \"DLL hijacking\" issue in library used by multiple media players.\n\n- CVE-2010-3152: \"DLL hijacking\" issue in illustration program.\n\n- CVE-2010-3147: \"DLL hijacking\" issue in address book.\n\n- CVE-2010-3135: \"DLL hijacking\" issue in network monitoring software.\n\n- CVE-2010-3131: \"DLL hijacking\" issue in web browser.\n\n- CVE-2010-1795: \"DLL hijacking\" issue in music player/organizer.\n\n- CVE-2002-1576: Product uses the current working directory to find and execute a program, which allows local users to gain privileges by creating a symlink that points to a malicious version of the program.\n\n- CVE-1999-1461: Product trusts the PATH environmental variable to find and execute a program, which allows local users to obtain root access by modifying the PATH to point to a malicous version of that program.\n\n- CVE-1999-1318: Software uses a search path that includes the current working directory (.), which allows local users to gain privileges via malicious programs.\n\n- CVE-2003-0579: Admin software trusts the user-supplied -uv.install command line option to find and execute the uv.install program, which allows local users to gain privileges by providing a pathname that is under control of the user.\n\n- CVE-2000-0854: When a document is opened, the directory of that document is first used to locate DLLs , which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands by inserting malicious DLLs into the same directory as the document.\n\n- CVE-2001-0943: Database trusts the PATH environment variable to find and execute programs, which allows local users to modify the PATH to point to malicious programs.\n\n- CVE-2001-0942: Database uses an environment variable to find and execute a program, which allows local users to execute arbitrary programs by changing the environment variable.\n\n- CVE-2001-0507: Server uses relative paths to find system files that will run in-process, which allows local users to gain privileges via a malicious file.\n\n- CVE-2002-2017: Product allows local users to execute arbitrary code by setting an environment variable to reference a malicious program.\n\n- CVE-1999-0690: Product includes the current directory in root's PATH variable.\n\n- CVE-2001-0912: Error during packaging causes product to include a hard-coded, non-standard directory in search path.\n\n- CVE-2001-0289: Product searches current working directory for configuration file.\n\n- CVE-2005-1705: Product searches current working directory for configuration file.\n\n- CVE-2005-1307: Product executable other program from current working directory.\n\n- CVE-2002-2040: Untrusted path.\n\n- CVE-2005-2072: Modification of trusted environment variable leads to untrusted path vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2005-1632: Product searches /tmp for modules before other paths.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-3115: Go before 1.14.14 and 1.15.x before 1.15.7 on Windows is vulnerable to Command Injection and remote code execution when using the \"go get\" command to fetch modules that make use of cgo (for example, cgo can execute a gcc program from an untrusted download).\n\n- CVE-2021-37617: The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud Server with a computer.

When using the default configuration of fish, changing to a directory automatically runs `git` commands in order to display information about the current repository in the prompt. If an attacker can convince a user to change their current directory into one controlled by the attacker, such as on a shared file system or extracted archive, fish will run arbitrary commands under the attacker's control. This problem has been fixed in fish 3.4.0. Note that running git in these directories, including using the git tab completion, remains a potential trigger for this issue. As a workaround, remove the `fish_git_prompt` function from the prompt.\n\n- CVE-2021-28953: The unofficial C/C++ Advanced Lint extension before 1.9.0 for Visual Studio Code allows attackers to execute arbitrary binaries if the user opens a crafted repository.\n\n- CVE-2022-23853: The LSP (Language Server Protocol) plugin in KDE Kate before 21.12.2 and KTextEditor before 5.91.0 tries to execute the associated LSP server binary when opening a file of a given type. If this binary is absent from the PATH, it will try running the LSP server binary in the directory of the file that was just opened (due to a misunderstanding of the QProcess API, that was never intended). This can be an untrusted directory.\n\n- CVE-2022-22528: SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) - version 16.0, installation makes an entry in the system PATH environment variable in Windows platform which, under certain conditions, allows a Standard User to execute malicious Windows binaries which may lead to privilege escalation on the local system. The issue is with the ASE installer and does not impact other ASE binaries. \n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-668 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-668 (ChildOf)",

One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location.

This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n",

This often exists in Linux-based code assuming the controlled nature of the root directory (/) or its subdirectories (/etc, etc), or a code that recursively accesses the parent directory. In Windows, the drive root and some of its subdirectories have weak permissions by default, which makes them uncontrolled.\n\n\nIn some Unix-based systems, a PATH might be created that contains an empty element, e.g. by splicing an empty variable into the PATH. This empty element can be interpreted as equivalent to the current working directory, which might be an untrusted search element.\n\n\nIn software package management frameworks (e.g., npm, RubyGems, or PyPi), the framework may identify dependencies on third-party libraries or other packages, then consult a repository that contains the desired package. The framework may search a public repository before a private repository. This could be exploited by attackers by placing a malicious package in the public repository that has the same name as a package from the private repository. The search path might not be directly under control of the developer relying on the framework, but this search order effectively contains an untrusted element.\n",

This often exists in Linux-based code assuming the controlled nature of the root directory (/) or its subdirectories (/etc, etc), or a code that recursively accesses the parent directory. In Windows, the drive root and some of its subdirectories have weak permissions by default, which makes them uncontrolled.\n\n\nIn some Unix-based systems, a PATH might be created that contains an empty element, e.g. by splicing an empty variable into the PATH. This empty element can be interpreted as equivalent to the current working directory, which might be an untrusted search element.\n\n\nIn software package management frameworks (e.g., npm, RubyGems, or PyPi), the framework may identify dependencies on third-party libraries or other packages, then consult a repository that contains the desired package. The framework may search a public repository before a private repository. This could be exploited by attackers by placing a malicious package in the public repository that has the same name as a package from the private repository. The search path might not be directly under control of the developer relying on the framework, but this search order effectively contains an untrusted element.\n",

NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-11736.\n\n- CVE-2021-21272: ORAS is open source software which enables a way to push OCI Artifacts to OCI Conformant registries. ORAS is both a CLI for initial testing and a Go Module. In ORAS from version 0.4.0 and before version 0.9.0, there is a \"zip-slip\" vulnerability. The directory support feature allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links and hard links. A well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who runs `oras pull`. Users of the affected versions are impacted if they are `oras` CLI users who runs `oras pull`, or if they are Go programs, which invoke `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`. The problem has been fixed in version 0.9.0. For `oras` CLI users, there is no workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider. For `oras` package users, the workaround is to not use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`, and use other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider.\n\n- CVE-2021-28650: autoar-extractor.c in GNOME gnome-autoar before 0.3.1, as used by GNOME Shell, Nautilus, and other software, allows Directory Traversal during extraction because it lacks a check of whether a file's parent is a symlink in certain complex situations. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-36241.\n\n- CVE-2021-32518: A vulnerability in share_link in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote attackers to create a symbolic link then access arbitrary files. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32803: The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.4.15, and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via insufficient symlink protection. `node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-32825: bblfshd is an open source self-hosted server for source code parsing. In bblfshd before commit 4265465b9b6fb5663c30ee43806126012066aad4 there is a \"zipslip\" vulnerability. The unsafe handling of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may enable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations outside the designated target folder. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive file. Additionally, if the attacker has read access to the unpacked files, he may be able to read arbitrary system files the parent process has permissions to read. For more details including a PoC see the referenced GHSL-2020-258.\n\n- CVE-2021-36286: Dell SupportAssist Client Consumer versions 3.9.13.0 and any versions prior to 3.9.13.0 contain an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability that can be exploited by using the Windows feature of NTFS called Symbolic links. Symbolic links can be created by any(non-privileged) user under some object directories, but by themselves are not sufficient to successfully escalate privileges. However, combining them with a different object, such as the NTFS junction point allows for the exploitation. Support assist clean files functionality do not distinguish junction points from the physical folder and proceeds to clean the target of the junction that allows nonprivileged users to create junction points and delete arbitrary files on the system which can be accessed only by the admin.\n\n- CVE-2021-38511: An issue was discovered in the tar crate before 0.4.36 for Rust. When symlinks are present in a TAR archive, extraction can create arbitrary directories via .. traversal.\n\n- CVE-2021-29136: Open Container Initiative umoci before 0.4.7 allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary host paths via a crafted image that causes symlink traversal when \"umoci unpack\" or \"umoci raw unpack\" is used.\n\n- CVE-2020-27833: A Zip Slip vulnerability was found in the oc binary in openshift-clients where an arbitrary file write is achieved by using a specially crafted raw container image (.tar file) which contains symbolic links. The vulnerability is limited to the command `oc image extract`. If a symbolic link is first created pointing within the tarball, this allows further symbolic links to bypass the existing path check. This flaw allows the tarball to create links outside the tarball's parent directory, allowing for executables or configuration files to be overwritten, resulting in arbitrary code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. Versions up to and including openshift-clients-4.7.0-202104250659.p0.git.95881af are affected.\n\n- CVE-2020-27697: Trend Micro Security 2020 (Consumer) contains a vulnerability in the installer package that could be exploited by placing a malicious DLL in a non-protected location with high privileges (symlink attack) which can lead to obtaining administrative privileges during the installation of the product.\n\n- CVE-2020-4717: A vulnerability exists in IBM SPSS Modeler Subscription Installer that allows a user with create symbolic link permission to write arbitrary file in another protected path during product installation. IBM X-Force ID: 187727.\n\n- CVE-2021-23239: The sudoedit personality of Sudo before 1.9.5 may allow a local unprivileged user to perform arbitrary directory-existence tests by winning a sudo_edit.c race condition in replacing a user-controlled directory by a symlink to an arbitrary path.\n\n- CVE-2021-32508: Absolute Path Traversal vulnerability in FileStreaming in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote authenticated attackers access arbitrary files by injecting the Symbolic Link following the Url path parameter. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32509: Absolute Path Traversal vulnerability in FileviewDoc in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote authenticated attackers access arbitrary files by injecting the Symbolic Link following the Url path parameter. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-24084: Windows Mobile Device Management Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-1642: Windows AppX Deployment Extensions Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-1685: Windows AppX Deployment Extensions Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-1695: Windows Print Spooler Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-1697: Windows InstallService Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-1729: Windows Update Stack Setup Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26425: Windows Event Tracing Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26426: Windows User Account Profile Picture Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26862: Windows Installer Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26866: Windows Update Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26873: Windows User Profile Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26887: <p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows when Folder redirection has been enabled via Group Policy. When folder redirection file server is co-located with Terminal server, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability would be able to begin redirecting another user's personal data to a created folder.</p> <p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker can create a new folder under the Folder Redirection root path and create a junction on a newly created User folder. When the new user logs in, Folder Redirection would start redirecting to the folder and copying personal data.</p> <p>This elevation of privilege vulnerability can only be addressed by reconfiguring Folder Redirection with Offline files and restricting permissions, and NOT via a security update for affected Windows Servers.

It affects multi-user setups in which \u2019guix-daemon\u2019 runs locally. The attack consists in having an unprivileged user spawn a build process, for instance with `guix build`, that makes its build directory world-writable. The user then creates a hardlink to a root-owned file such as /etc/shadow in that build directory. If the user passed the --keep-failed option and the build eventually fails, the daemon changes ownership of the whole build tree, including the hardlink, to the user. At that point, the user has write access to the target file. Versions after and including v0.11.0-3298-g2608e40988, and versions prior to v1.2.0-75109-g94f0312546 are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2020-28007: Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Execution with Unnecessary Privileges. Because Exim operates as root in the log directory (owned by a non-root user), a symlink or hard link attack allows overwriting critical root-owned files anywhere on the filesystem.\n\n- CVE-2021-22488: There is an Unauthorized file access vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability by modifying soft links may tamper with the files restored from backups.\n\n- CVE-2021-23872: Privilege Escalation vulnerability in the File Lock component of McAfee Total Protection (MTP) prior to 16.0.32 allows a local user to gain elevated privileges by manipulating a symbolic link in the IOCTL interface.\n\n- CVE-2021-23873: Privilege Escalation vulnerability in McAfee Total Protection (MTP) prior to 16.0.30 allows a local user to gain elevated privileges and perform arbitrary file deletion as the SYSTEM user potentially causing Denial of Service via manipulating Junction link, after enumerating certain files, at a specific time.\n\n- CVE-2021-34408: The Zoom Client for Meetings for Windows in all versions before version 5.3.2 writes log files to a user writable directory as a privileged user during the installation or update of the client. This could allow for potential privilege escalation if a link was created between the user writable directory used and a non-user writable directory.\n\n- CVE-2021-36744: Trend Micro Security (Consumer) 2021 and 2020 are vulnerable to a directory junction vulnerability which could allow an attacker to exploit the system to escalate privileges and create a denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2021-37969: Inappropriate implementation in Google Updater in Google Chrome on Windows prior to 94.0.4606.54 allowed a remote attacker to perform local privilege escalation via a crafted file.\n\n- CVE-2021-44038: An issue was discovered in Quagga through 1.2.4.

By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-37032: Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a.

A path traversal vulnerability exists in versions prior to 15.3.18, 15.5.3, and 16.0.0. Using a specially prepared ZIP file, it is possible to overwrite any file that is writable by the application server user (e.g. the tomcat user). Depending on the configuration this can be limited to files of the OpenOlat user data directory, however, if not properly set up, the attack could also be used to overwrite application server config files, java code or even operating system files. The attack could be used to corrupt or modify any OpenOlat file such as course structures, config files or temporary test data. Those attack would require in-depth knowledge of the installation and thus more theoretical. If the app server configuration allows the execution of jsp files and the path to the context is known, it is also possible to execute java code. If the app server runs with the same user that is used to deploy the OpenOlat code or has write permissions on the OpenOlat code files and the path to the context is know, code injection is possible. The attack requires an OpenOlat user account to upload a ZIP file and trigger the unzip method. It can not be exploited by unregistered users. The problem is fixed in versions 15.3.18, 15.5.3 and 16.0.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.\n\n- CVE-2020-19146: Improper Access Control in Jfinal CMS v4.7.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via the 'TemplatePath' parameter in the component 'jfinal_cms/admin/folder/list'.\n\n- CVE-2020-19147: Improper Access Control in Jfinal CMS v4.7.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive infromation via the 'getFolder()' function in the component '/modules/filemanager/FileManager.java'.\n\n- CVE-2020-26806: admin/file.do in ObjectPlanet Opinio before 7.15 allows Unrestricted File Upload of executable JSP files, resulting in remote code execution, because filePath can have directory traversal and fileContent can be valid JSP code.\n\n- CVE-2021-20034: An improper access control vulnerability in SMA100 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to bypass the path traversal checks and delete an arbitrary file potentially resulting in a reboot to factory default settings.\n\n- CVE-2021-23428: This affects all versions of package elFinder.NetCore.

The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation of URLs in HTTP requests processed by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request containing directory traversal character sequences to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view arbitrary files within the web services file system on the targeted device. The web services file system is enabled when the affected device is configured with either WebVPN or AnyConnect features. This vulnerability cannot be used to obtain access to ASA or FTD system files or underlying operating system (OS) files.\n\n- CVE-2020-11652: An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt before 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. The salt-master process ClearFuncs class allows access to some methods that improperly sanitize paths. These methods allow arbitrary directory access to authenticated users.\n\n- CVE-2020-1631: A vulnerability in the HTTP/HTTPS service used by J-Web, Web Authentication, Dynamic-VPN (DVPN), Firewall Authentication Pass-Through with Web-Redirect, and Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) allows an unauthenticated attacker to perform local file inclusion (LFI) or path traversal. Using this vulnerability, an attacker may be able to inject commands into the httpd.log, read files with 'world' readable permission file or obtain J-Web session tokens. In the case of command injection, as the HTTP service runs as user 'nobody', the impact of this command injection is limited. (CVSS score 5.3, vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) In the case of reading files with 'world' readable permission, in Junos OS 19.3R1 and above, the unauthenticated attacker would be able to read the configuration file. (CVSS score 5.9, vector CVSS:3.1/ AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) If J-Web is enabled, the attacker could gain the same level of access of anyone actively logged into J-Web. If an administrator is logged in, the attacker could gain administrator access to J-Web. (CVSS score 8.8, vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) This issue only affects Juniper Networks Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services enabled. Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services disabled are not affected. If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled, the following command will show the httpd processes: user@device> show system processes | match http 5260 - S 0:00.13 /usr/sbin/httpd-gk -N 5797 - I 0:00.10 /usr/sbin/httpd --config /jail/var/etc/httpd.conf To summarize: If HTTP/HTTPS services are disabled, there is no impact from this vulnerability. If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled and J-Web is not in use, this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.9 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N). If J-Web is enabled, this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Juniper SIRT has received a single report of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild. Out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying customers so they can take appropriate actions. Indicators of Compromise: The /var/log/httpd.log may have indicators that commands have injected or files being accessed. The device administrator can look for these indicators by searching for the string patterns \"=*;*&\" or \"*%3b*&\" in /var/log/httpd.log, using the following command: user@device> show log httpd.log | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" If this command returns any output, it might be an indication of malicious attempts or simply scanning activities. Rotated logs should also be reviewed, using the following command: user@device> show log httpd.log.0.gz | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" user@device> show log httpd.log.1.gz | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" Note that a skilled attacker would likely remove these entries from the local log file, thus effectively eliminating any reliable signature that the device had been attacked.

Argo CD starting with version 1.3.0 but before versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0 is vulnerable to a path traversal bug, compounded by an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious user with read-only repository access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user who has been granted `get` access for a repository containing a Helm chart can craft an API request to the `/api/v1/repositories/{repo_url}/appdetails` endpoint to leak the contents of out-of-bounds files from the repo-server. The malicious payload would reference an out-of-bounds file, and the contents of that file would be returned as part of the response. Contents from a non-YAML file may be returned as part of an error message. The attacker would have to know or guess the location of the target file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include files from other Applications' source repositories or any secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. This vulnerability is patched in Argo CD versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0. The patches prevent path traversal and limit access to users who either A) have been granted Application `create` privileges or B) have been granted Application `get` privileges and are requesting details for a `repo_url` that has already been used for the given Application. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-27925: Zimbra Collaboration (aka ZCS) 8.8.15 and 9.0 has mboximport functionality that receives a ZIP archive and extracts files from it.

This is accomplished by extracting package contents into a project's `node_modules` folder. If the `node_modules` folder of the root project or any of its dependencies is somehow replaced with a symbolic link, it could allow Arborist to write package dependencies to any arbitrary location on the file system. Note that symbolic links contained within package artifact contents are filtered out, so another means of creating a `node_modules` symbolic link would have to be employed. 1. A `preinstall` script could replace `node_modules` with a symlink. (This is prevented by using `--ignore-scripts`.) 2. An attacker could supply the target with a git repository, instructing them to run `npm install --ignore-scripts` in the root. This may be successful, because `npm install --ignore-scripts` is typically not capable of making changes outside of the project directory, so it may be deemed safe. This is patched in @npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above.

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2022-26612: In Apache Hadoop, The unTar function uses unTarUsingJava function on Windows and the built-in tar utility on Unix and other OSes. As a result, a TAR entry may create a symlink under the expected extraction directory which points to an external directory. A subsequent TAR entry may extract an arbitrary file into the external directory using the symlink name. This however would be caught by the same targetDirPath check on Unix because of the getCanonicalPath call. However on Windows, getCanonicalPath doesn't resolve symbolic links, which bypasses the check. unpackEntries during TAR extraction follows symbolic links which allows writing outside expected base directory on Windows. This was addressed in Apache Hadoop 3.2.3\n\n- CVE-2022-3592: A symlink following vulnerability was found in Samba, where a user can create a symbolic link that will make 'smbd' escape the configured share path. This flaw allows a remote user with access to the exported part of the file system under a share via SMB1 unix extensions or NFS to create symlinks to files outside the 'smbd' configured share path and gain access to another restricted server's filesystem.\n\n- CVE-2022-36113: Cargo is a package manager for the rust programming language. After a package is downloaded, Cargo extracts its source code in the ~/.cargo folder on disk, making it available to the Rust projects it builds. To record when an extraction is successful, Cargo writes \"ok\" to the .cargo-ok file at the root of the extracted source code once it extracted all the files. It was discovered that Cargo allowed packages to contain a .cargo-ok symbolic link, which Cargo would extract. Then, when Cargo attempted to write \"ok\" into .cargo-ok, it would actually replace the first two bytes of the file the symlink pointed to with ok. This would allow an attacker to corrupt one file on the machine using Cargo to extract the package. Note that by design Cargo allows code execution at build time, due to build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerabilities in this advisory allow performing a subset of the possible damage in a harder to track down way. Your dependencies must still be trusted if you want to be protected from attacks, as it's possible to perform the same attacks with build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerability is present in all versions of Cargo. Rust 1.64, to be released on September 22nd, will include a fix for it. Since the vulnerability is just a more limited way to accomplish what a malicious build scripts or procedural macros can do, we decided not to publish Rust point releases backporting the security fix. Patch files are available for Rust 1.63.0 are available in the wg-security-response repository for people building their own toolchain. Mitigations We recommend users of alternate registries to exercise care in which package they download, by only including trusted dependencies in their projects. Please note that even with these vulnerabilities fixed, by design Cargo allows arbitrary code execution at build time thanks to build scripts and procedural macros: a malicious dependency will be able to cause damage regardless of these vulnerabilities. crates.io implemented server-side checks to reject these kinds of packages years ago, and there are no packages on crates.io exploiting these vulnerabilities. crates.io users still need to exercise care in choosing their dependencies though, as remote code execution is allowed by design there as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24904: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with version 0.7.0 and prior to versions 2.1.15m 2.2.9, and 2.3.4 is vulnerable to a symlink following bug allowing a malicious user with repository write access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user with write access for a repository which is (or may be) used in a directory-type Application may commit a symlink which points to an out-of-bounds file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include manifest files from other Applications' source repositories (potentially decrypted files, if you are using a decryption plugin) or any JSON-formatted secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.4, 2.2.9, and 2.1.15. Users of versions 2.3.0 or above who do not have any Jsonnet/directory-type Applications may disable the Jsonnet/directory config management tool as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-35631: On MacOS and Linux, it may be possible to perform a symlink attack by replacing this predictable file name with a symlink to another file and have the Velociraptor client overwrite the other file. This issue was resolved in Velociraptor 0.6.5-2.\n\n- CVE-2022-45440: A vulnerability exists in the FTP server of the Zyxel AX7501-B0 firmware prior to V5.17(ABPC.3)C0, which processes symbolic links on external storage media. A local authenticated attacker with administrator privileges could abuse this vulnerability to access the root file system by creating a symbolic link on external storage media, such as a USB flash drive, and then logging into the FTP server on a vulnerable device.\n\n- CVE-2022-21944: A UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following vulnerability in the systemd service file for watchman of openSUSE Backports SLE-15-SP3, Factory allows local attackers to escalate to root. This issue affects: openSUSE Backports SLE-15-SP3 watchman versions prior to 4.9.0. openSUSE Factory watchman versions prior to 4.9.0-9.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-31250: A UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following vulnerability in keylime of openSUSE Tumbleweed allows local attackers to escalate from the keylime user to root. This issue affects: openSUSE Tumbleweed keylime versions prior to 6.4.2-1.1.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-59 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-362 (Requires)\n\n- CWE-340 (Requires)\n\n- CWE-386 (Requires)\n\n- CWE-732 (Requires)",

During viewing of a malicious request, it can be manipulated into issuing a request that does not respect its upstream proxy configuration. This could leak NetNTLM hashes on Windows systems that fail to block outbound SMB.\n\n- CVE-2021-30127: TerraMaster F2-210 devices through 2021-04-03 use UPnP to make the admin web server accessible over the Internet on TCP port 8181, which is arguably inconsistent with the \"It is only available on the local network\" documentation. NOTE: manually editing /etc/upnp.json provides a partial but undocumented workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31810: An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.6.7, 2.7.x through 2.7.3, and 3.x through 3.0.1. A malicious FTP server can use the PASV response to trick Net::FTP into connecting back to a given IP address and port. This potentially makes curl extract information about services that are otherwise private and not disclosed (e.g., the attacker can conduct port scans and service banner extractions).\n\n- CVE-2021-20999: In Weidm\u00fcller u-controls and IoT-Gateways in versions up to 1.12.1 a network port intended only for device-internal usage is accidentally accessible via external network interfaces. By exploiting this vulnerability the device may be manipulated or the operation may be stopped.\n\n- CVE-2021-21210: Inappropriate implementation in Network in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.72 allowed a remote attacker to potentially access local UDP ports via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-42343: An issue was discovered in the Dask distributed package before 2021.10.0 for Python. Single machine Dask clusters started with dask.distributed.LocalCluster or dask.distributed.Client (which defaults to using LocalCluster) would mistakenly configure their respective Dask workers to listen on external interfaces (typically with a randomly selected high port) rather than only on localhost. A Dask cluster created using this method (when running on a machine that has an applicable port exposed) could be used by a sophisticated attacker to achieve remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2021-22916: In Brave Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.26.60, when adblocking is enabled and a proxy browser extension is installed, the CNAME adblocking feature issues DNS requests that used the system DNS settings instead of the extension's proxy settings, resulting in possible information disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2021-22917: Brave Browser Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.20 is vulnerable to information disclosure by way of DNS requests in Tor windows not flowing through Tor if adblocking was enabled.\n\n- CVE-2020-4062: In Conjur OSS Helm Chart before 2.0.0, a recently identified critical vulnerability resulted in the installation of the Conjur Postgres database with an open port. This allows an attacker to gain full read & write access to the Conjur Postgres database, including escalating the attacker's privileges to assume full control. A malicious actor who knows the IP address and port number of the Postgres database and has access into the Kubernetes cluster where Conjur runs can gain full read & write access to the Postgres database. This enables the attacker to write a policy that allows full access to retrieve any secret. This Helm chart is a method to install Conjur OSS into a Kubernetes environment. Hence, the systems impacted are only Conjur OSS systems that were deployed using this chart. Other deployments including Docker and the CyberArk Dynamic Access Provider (DAP) are not affected. To remediate this vulnerability, clone the latest Helm Chart and follow the upgrade instructions. If you are not able to fully remediate this vulnerability immediately, you can mitigate some of the risk by making sure Conjur OSS is deployed on an isolated Kubernetes cluster or namespace. The term \"isolated\" refers to: - No other workloads besides Conjur OSS and its backend database are running in that Kubernetes cluster/namespace. - Kubernetes and helm access to the cluster/namespace is limited to security administrators via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).\n\n- CVE-2020-10087: GitLab before 12.8.2 allows Information Disclosure. Badge images were not being proxied, causing mixed content warnings as well as leaking the IP address of the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-32690: Helm is a tool for managing Charts (packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources). In versions of helm prior to 3.6.1, a vulnerability exists where the username and password credentials associated with a Helm repository could be passed on to another domain referenced by that Helm repository. This issue has been resolved in 3.6.1. There is a workaround through which one may check for improperly passed credentials. One may use a username and password for a Helm repository and may audit the Helm repository in order to check for another domain being used that could have received the credentials. In the `index.yaml` file for that repository, one may look for another domain in the `urls` list for the chart versions. If there is another domain found and that chart version was pulled or installed, the credentials would be passed on.\n\n- CVE-2021-32707: Nextcloud Mail is a mail app for Nextcloud. In versions prior to 1.9.6, the Nextcloud Mail application does not, by default, render images in emails to not leak the read state. The privacy filter failed to filter images with a `background-image` CSS attribute. Note that the images were still passed through the Nextcloud image proxy, and thus there was no IP leakage. The issue was patched in version 1.9.6 and 1.10.0. No workarounds are known to exist.\n\n- CVE-2020-14312: A flaw was found in the default configuration of dnsmasq, as shipped with Fedora versions prior to 31 and in all versions Red Hat Enterprise Linux, where it listens on any interface and accepts queries from addresses outside of its local subnet. In particular, the option `local-service` is not enabled. Running dnsmasq in this manner may inadvertently make it an open resolver accessible from any address on the internet. This flaw allows an attacker to conduct a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against other systems.\n\n- CVE-2021-20149: Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 does not have sufficient access controls for the WAN interface. The default iptables ruleset for governing access to services on the device only apply to IPv4. All services running on the devices are accessible via the WAN interface via IPv6 by default.\n\n- CVE-2020-1938: When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations.\n\n- CVE-2022-22547: Simple Diagnostics Agent - versions 1.0 (up to version 1.57.), allows an attacker to access information which would otherwise be restricted via a random port 9000-65535. This allows information gathering which could be used exploit future open-source security exploits.\n\n- CVE-2022-44784: An issue was discovered in Appalti & Contratti 9.12.2. The target web applications LFS and DL229 expose a set of services provided by the Axis 1.4 instance, embedded directly into the applications, as hinted by the WEB-INF/web.xml file leaked through Local File Inclusion. Among the exposed services, there is the Axis AdminService, which, through the default configuration, should normally be accessible only by the localhost. Nevertheless, by trying to access the mentioned service, both in LFS and DL229, the service can actually be reached even by remote users, allowing creation of arbitrary services on the server side. When an attacker can reach the AdminService, they can use it to instantiate arbitrary services on the server. The exploit procedure is well known and described in Generic AXIS-SSRF exploitation. Basically, the attack consists of writing a JSP page inside the root directory of the web application, through the org.apache.axis.handlers.LogHandler class.\n\n- CVE-2022-26834: Improper access control vulnerability in Rakuten Casa version AP_F_V1_4_1 or AP_F_V2_0_0 allows a remote attacker to obtain the information stored in the product because the product is set to accept HTTP connections from the WAN side by default.\n\n- CVE-2022-4390: A network misconfiguration is present in versions prior to 1.0.9.90 of the NETGEAR RAX30 AX2400 series of routers. IPv6 is enabled for the WAN interface by default on these devices. While there are firewall restrictions in place that define access restrictions for IPv4 traffic, these restrictions do not appear to be applied to the WAN interface for IPv6. This allows arbitrary access to any services running on the device that may be inadvertently listening via IPv6, such as the SSH and Telnet servers spawned on ports 22 and 23 by default. This misconfiguration could allow an attacker to interact with services only intended to be accessible by clients on the local network.\n\n- CVE-2022-45414: If a Thunderbird user quoted from an HTML email, for example by replying to the email, and the email contained either a VIDEO tag with the POSTER attribute or an OBJECT tag with a DATA attribute, a network request to the referenced remote URL was performed, regardless of a configuration to block remote content. An image loaded from the POSTER attribute was shown in the composer window. These issues could have given an attacker additional capabilities when targetting releases that did not yet have a fix for CVE-2022-3033 which was reported around three months ago. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.5.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-47717: Last Yard 22.09.8-1 is vulnerable to Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).\n\n- CVE-2022-3057: Inappropriate implementation in iframe Sandbox in Google Chrome prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-31055: kCTF is a Kubernetes-based infrastructure for capture the flag (CTF) competitions. Prior to version 1.6.0, the kctf cluster set-src-ip-ranges was broken and allowed traffic from any IP. The problem has been patched in v1.6.0. As a workaround, those who want to test challenges privately can mark them as `public: false` and use `kctf chal debug port-forward` to connect.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",

The TCP header processing code doesn't sanitize the value of the IP total length field (header length + data length). With a crafted IP packet, an integer overflow occurs whenever the value of the IP data length is calculated by subtracting the length of the header from the total length of the IP packet.\n\n- CVE-2021-31802: NETGEAR R7000 1.0.11.116 devices have a heap-based Buffer Overflow that is exploitable from the local network without authentication. The vulnerability exists within the handling of an HTTP request. An attacker can leverage this to execute code as root. The problem is that a user-provided length value is trusted during a backup.cgi file upload. The attacker must add a \\\\n before the Content-Length header.\n\n- CVE-2021-37663: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions due to incomplete validation in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeV2`, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/84d053187cb80d975ef2b9684d4b61981bca0c41/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_op.cc#L59) has some validation but does not check that `min_range` and `max_range` both have the same non-zero number of elements. If `axis` is provided (i.e., not `-1`), then validation should check that it is a value in range for the rank of `input` tensor and then the lengths of `min_range` and `max_range` inputs match the `axis` dimension of the `input` tensor. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 6da6620efad397c85493b8f8667b821403516708. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-37665: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions due to incomplete validation in MKL implementation of requantization, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays.

Missing size validations on inbound SCTP packets may allow the kernel to read uninitialized memory.\n\n- CVE-2021-21404: Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program. In Syncthing before version 1.15.0, the relay server `strelaysrv` can be caused to crash and exit by sending a relay message with a negative length field. Similarly, Syncthing itself can crash for the same reason if given a malformed message from a malicious relay server when attempting to join the relay.

Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-25727: Memory Corruption in modem due to improper length check while copying into memory in Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Voice & Music\n\n- CVE-2022-25793: A Stack-based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in Autodesk 3ds Max 2022, 2021, and 2020 may lead to code execution through the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer when parsing ActionScript Byte Code files.

Azure RTOS USBX implementation of host support for USB CDC ECM includes an integer underflow and a buffer overflow in the `_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function which may be potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution or denial of service. Setting mac address string descriptor length to a `0` or `1` allows an attacker to introduce an integer underflow followed (string_length) by a buffer overflow of the `cdc_ecm -> ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id` array. This may allow one to redirect the code execution flow or introduce a denial of service. The fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel). Improved mac address string descriptor length validation to check for unexpectedly small values may be used as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-36620: D-link DIR-816 A2_v1.10CNB04, DIR-878 DIR_878_FW1.30B08.img is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via /goform/addRouting.\n\n- CVE-2022-37134: D-link DIR-816 A2_v1.10CNB04.img is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via /goform/form2Wan.cgi.

Prior to version 0.10.2, the heap initialization methods were missing a minimum size check for the given heap size argument. This could lead to out-of-bound writes when a heap was initialized with a size smaller than `3 * size_of::<usize>` because of metadata write operations. This vulnerability impacts all the initialization functions on the `Heap` and `LockedHeap` types, including `Heap::new`, `Heap::init`, `Heap::init_from_slice`, and `LockedHeap::new`. It also affects multiple uses of the `Heap::extend` method. Version 0.10.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, ensure that the heap is only initialized with a size larger than `3 * size_of::<usize>` and that the `Heap::extend` method is only called with sizes larger than `2 * size_of::<usize>()`. Also, ensure that the total heap size is (and stays) a multiple of `2 * size_of::<usize>()`.\n\n- CVE-2022-36938: DexLoader function get_stringidx_fromdex() in Redex prior to commit 3b44c64 can load an out of bound address when loading the string index table, potentially allowing remote code execution during processing of a 3rd party Android APK file.\n\n- CVE-2021-1058: NVIDIA vGPU software contains a vulnerability in the guest kernel mode driver and vGPU plugin, in which an input data size is not validated, which may lead to tampering of data or denial of service.

Prior to commit number 0b962f218f0cdd796dadfe26c3f09e68f7861b26, a bug in `pallet-ethereum` can cause invalid transactions to be included in the Ethereum block state in `pallet-ethereum` due to not validating the input data size. Any invalid transactions included this way have no possibility to alter the internal Ethereum or Substrate state. The transaction will appear to have be included, but is of no effect as it is rejected by the EVM engine. The impact is further limited by Substrate extrinsic size constraints. A patch is available in commit number 0b962f218f0cdd796dadfe26c3f09e68f7861b26. There are no workarounds aside from applying the patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-39690: In setDisplayPadding of WallpaperManagerService.java, there is a possible way to cause a persistent DoS due to improper input validation.

This crash affects the availability of the software and dependent downstream components.\n\n- CVE-2022-23580: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. During shape inference, TensorFlow can allocate a large vector based on a value from a tensor controlled by the user. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-29202: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.ragged.constant` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a denial of service by consuming all available memory. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36078: Binary provides encoding/decoding in Borsh and other formats. The vulnerability is a memory allocation vulnerability that can be exploited to allocate slices in memory with (arbitrary) excessive size value, which can either exhaust available memory or crash the whole program. When using `github.com/gagliardetto/binary` to parse unchecked (or wrong type of) data from untrusted sources of input (e.g. the blockchain) into slices, it's possible to allocate memory with excessive size. When `dec.Decode(&val)` method is used to parse data into a structure that is or contains slices of values, the length of the slice was previously read directly from the data itself without any checks on the size of it, and then a slice was allocated. This could lead to an overflow and an allocation of memory with excessive size value. Users should upgrade to `v0.7.1` or higher. A workaround is not to rely on the `dec.Decode(&val)` function to parse the data, but to use a custom `UnmarshalWithDecoder()` method that reads and checks the length of any slice.\n\n- CVE-2022-37311: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large location request parameter to the redirect servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-37312: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large request body containing a redirect URL to the deferrer servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-39294: conduit-hyper integrates a conduit application with the hyper server. Prior to version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` did not check any limit on a request's length before calling [`hyper::body::to_bytes`](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/body/fn.to_bytes.html). An attacker could send a malicious request with an abnormally large `Content-Length`, which could lead to a panic if memory allocation failed for that request. In version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` sets an internal limit of 128 MiB per request, otherwise returning status 400 (\"Bad Request\"). This crate is part of the implementation of Rust's [crates.io](https://crates.io/), but that service is not affected due to its existing cloud infrastructure, which already drops such malicious requests. Even with the new limit in place, `conduit-hyper` is not recommended for production use, nor to directly serve the public Internet.\n\n- CVE-2022-4111: Unrestricted file size limit can lead to DoS in tooljet/tooljet <1.27 by allowing a logged in attacker to upload profile pictures over 2MB. \n\n- CVE-2022-41968: Nextcloud Server is an open source personal cloud server. Prior to versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.5, calendar name lengths are not validated before writing to a database. As a result, an attacker can send unnecessary amounts of data against the database. Version 23.0.10 and 24.0.5 contain patches for the issue. No known workarounds are available.\n\n- CVE-2022-20488: In NotificationChannel of NotificationChannel.java, there is a possible failure to persist permissions settings due to resource exhaustion. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-12 Android-12L Android-13Android ID: A-242703217\n\n- CVE-2022-20491: In NotificationChannel of NotificationChannel.java, there is a possible failure to persist permissions settings due to resource exhaustion. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-12 Android-12L Android-13Android ID: A-242703556\n\n- CVE-2022-20691: A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol functionality of Cisco ATA 190 Series Adaptive Telephone Adapter firmware could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a DoS condition of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to missing length validation of certain Cisco Discovery Protocol packet header fields. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to exhaust available memory and cause the service to restart. Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability. \n\n- CVE-2022-21208: The package node-opcua before 2.74.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to a missing limitation on the number of received chunks - per single session or in total for all concurrent sessions. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending an unlimited number of huge chunks (e.g. 2GB each) without sending the Final closing chunk.\n\n- CVE-2022-29212: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, certain TFLite models that were created using TFLite model converter would crash when loaded in the TFLite interpreter. The culprit is that during quantization the scale of values could be greater than 1 but code was always assuming sub-unit scaling. Thus, since code was calling `QuantizeMultiplierSmallerThanOneExp`, the `TFLITE_CHECK_LT` assertion would trigger and abort the process. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29196: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackpropFilterV2` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate that the `filter_sizes` argument is a vector. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29200: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.LSTMBlockCell` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate the ranks of any of the arguments to this API call. This results in `CHECK`-failures when the elements of the tensor are accessed. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-789 (CanPrecede)",

If the token cannot match, the engine \"backtracks\" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.\n Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:\n\n\n  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.\n\n  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.\n\n  - The input can be long enough.\n\n Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. \n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-5243: server allows ReDOS with crafted User-Agent strings, due to overlapping capture groups that cause excessive backtracking.\n\n- CVE-2021-21317: npm package for user-agent parser prone to ReDoS due to overlapping capture groups\n\n- CVE-2019-16215: Markdown parser uses inefficient regex when processing a message, allowing users to cause CPU consumption and delay preventing processing of other messages.\n\n- CVE-2019-6785: Long string in a version control product allows DoS due to an inefficient regex.\n\n- CVE-2019-12041: Javascript code allows ReDoS via a long string due to excessive backtracking.\n\n- CVE-2015-8315: ReDoS when parsing time.\n\n- CVE-2015-8854: ReDoS when parsing documents.\n\n- CVE-2017-16021: ReDoS when validating URL.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-32740: Addressable is an alternative implementation to the URI implementation that is part of Ruby's standard library. An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability exists after version 2.3.0 through version 2.7.0. Within the URI template implementation in Addressable, a maliciously crafted template may result in uncontrolled resource consumption, leading to denial of service when matched against a URI. In typical usage, templates would not normally be read from untrusted user input, but nonetheless, no previous security advisory for Addressable has cautioned against doing this. Users of the parsing capabilities in Addressable but not the URI template capabilities are unaffected. The vulnerability is patched in version 2.8.0. As a workaround, only create Template objects from trusted sources that have been validated not to produce catastrophic backtracking.\n\n- CVE-2021-32763: OpenProject is open-source, web-based project management software. In versions prior to 11.3.3, the `MessagesController` class of OpenProject has a `quote` method that implements the logic behind the Quote button in the discussion forums, and it uses a regex to strip `<pre>` tags from the message being quoted. The `(.|\\\\s)` part can match a space character in two ways, so an unterminated `<pre>` tag containing `n` spaces causes Ruby's regex engine to backtrack to try 2<sup>n</sup> states in the NFA. This will result in a Regular Expression Denial of Service. The issue is fixed in OpenProject 11.3.3. As a workaround, one may install the patch manually.\n\n- CVE-2021-32838: Flask-RESTX (pypi package flask-restx) is a community driven fork of Flask-RESTPlus.

In affected versions unsanitised input of regular expression date within the parameters of the DPL parser function, allowed for the possibility of ReDoS (Regex Denial of Service). This has been resolved in version 3.3.6. If you are unable to update you may also set `$wgDplSettings['functionalRichness'] = 0;` or disable DynamicPageList3 to mitigate.\n\n- CVE-2021-41186: Fluentd collects events from various data sources and writes them to files to help unify logging infrastructure. The parser_apache2 plugin in Fluentd v0.14.14 to v1.14.1 suffers from a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability. A broken apache log with a certain pattern of string can spend too much time in a regular expression, resulting in the potential for a DoS attack. This issue is patched in version 1.14.2 There are two workarounds available. Either don't use parser_apache2 for parsing logs (which cannot guarantee generated by Apache), or put patched version of parser_apache2.rb into /etc/fluent/plugin directory (or any other directories specified by the environment variable `FLUENT_PLUGIN` or `--plugin` option of fluentd).\n\n- CVE-2021-42836: GJSON before 1.9.3 allows a ReDoS (regular expression denial of service) attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-44686: calibre before 5.32.0 contains a regular expression that is vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) in html_preprocess_rules in ebooks/conversion/preprocess.py.\n\n- CVE-2020-1920: A regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the validateBaseUrl function can cause the application to use excessive resources, become unresponsive, or crash.

Versions prior to 3.6.5 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. The vulnerability is present in PunktSentenceTokenizer, sent_tokenize and word_tokenize. Any users of this class, or these two functions, are vulnerable to the ReDoS attack. In short, a specifically crafted long input to any of these vulnerable functions will cause them to take a significant amount of execution time. If your program relies on any of the vulnerable functions for tokenizing unpredictable user input, then we would strongly recommend upgrading to a version of NLTK without the vulnerability. For users unable to upgrade the execution time can be bounded by limiting the maximum length of an input to any of the vulnerable functions. Our recommendation is to implement such a limit.\n\n- CVE-2021-23354: The package printf before 0.6.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the regex string /\\\\%(?:\\\\(([\\\\w_.]+)\\\\)|([1-9]\\\\d*)\\\\$)?([0 +\\\\-\\\\]*)(\\\\*|\\\\d+)?(\\\\.)?(\\\\*|\\\\d+)?[hlL]?([\\\\%bscdeEfFgGioOuxX])/g in lib/printf.js.

In affected versions Zulip allows organization administrators on a server to configure \"linkifiers\" that automatically create links from messages that users send, detected via arbitrary regular expressions. Malicious organization administrators could subject the server to a denial-of-service via regular expression complexity attacks; most simply, by configuring a quadratic-time regular expression in a linkifier, and sending messages that exploited it. A regular expression attempted to parse the user-provided regexes to verify that they were safe from ReDoS -- this was both insufficient, as well as _itself_ subject to ReDoS if the organization administrator entered a sufficiently complex invalid regex. Affected users should [upgrade to the just-released Zulip 4.7](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release), or [`main`](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-from-a-git-repository).\n\n- CVE-2021-41817: Date.parse in the date gem through 3.2.0 for Ruby allows ReDoS (regular expression Denial of Service) via a long string.

The exploitation of this vulnerability could be triggered via the parse function.\n\n- CVE-2022-21681: Marked is a markdown parser and compiler. Prior to version 4.0.10, the regular expression `inline.reflinkSearch` may cause catastrophic backtracking against some strings and lead to a denial of service (DoS). Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version of marked and does not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is patched in version 4.0.10. As a workaround, avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run marked on a worker thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources.\n\n- CVE-2022-24373: The package react-native-reanimated before 3.0.0-rc.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to improper usage of regular expression in the parser of Colors.js.\n\n- CVE-2022-24713: regex is an implementation of regular expressions for the Rust language. The regex crate features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service attacks caused by untrusted regexes, or untrusted input matched by trusted regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered part of the crate's API. Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing, and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to services accepting user-controlled, untrusted regexes. All versions of the regex crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this issue. The fix is include starting from regex 1.5.5. All users accepting user-controlled regexes are recommended to upgrade immediately to the latest version of the regex crate. Unfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are practically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability. Because of this, it us not recommend to deny known problematic regexes.\n\n- CVE-2022-25598: Apache DolphinScheduler user registration is vulnerable to Regular express Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks, Apache DolphinScheduler users should upgrade to version 2.0.5 or higher.\n\n- CVE-2022-25758: All versions of package scss-tokenizer are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the loadAnnotation() function, due to the usage of insecure regex.\n\n- CVE-2022-25844: The package angular after 1.7.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) by providing a custom locale rule that makes it possible to assign the parameter in posPre: ' '.repeat() of NUMBER_FORMATS.PATTERNS[1].posPre with a very high value. **Note:** 1) This package has been deprecated and is no longer maintained. 2) The vulnerable versions are 1.7.0 and higher.\n\n- CVE-2022-25858: The package terser before 4.8.1, from 5.0.0 and before 5.14.2 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to insecure usage of regular expressions.\n\n- CVE-2022-25887: The package sanitize-html before 2.7.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to insecure global regular expression replacement logic of HTML comment removal.\n\n- CVE-2022-25918: The package shescape from 1.5.10 and before 1.6.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the escape function in index.js, due to the usage of insecure regex in the escapeArgBash function.\n\n- CVE-2022-29158: Apache OFBiz up to version 18.12.05 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the way it handles URLs provided by external, unauthenticated users.

Hawk used a regular expression to parse `Host` HTTP header (`Hawk.utils.parseHost()`), which was subject to regular expression DoS attack - meaning each added character in the attacker's input increases the computation time exponentially. `parseHost()` was patched in `9.0.1` to use built-in `URL` class to parse hostname instead. `Hawk.authenticate()` accepts `options` argument. If that contains `host` and `port`, those would be used instead of a call to `utils.parseHost()`.\n\n- CVE-2022-29169: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions starting with 2.2 and prior to 2.3.19, 2.4.7, and 2.5.0-beta.2 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. By using specific a RegularExpression, an attacker can cause denial of service for the bbb-html5 service. The useragent library performs checking of device by parsing the input of User-Agent header and lets it go through lookupUserAgent() (alias of useragent.lookup() ). This function handles input by regexing and attackers can abuse that by providing some ReDos payload using `SmartWatch`. The maintainers removed `htmlclient/useragent` from versions 2.3.19, 2.4.7, and 2.5.0-beta.2. As a workaround, disable NginX forwarding the requests to the handler according to the directions in the GitHub Security Advisory.\n\n- CVE-2022-31129: moment is a JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates.

Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login.\n\n- CVE-2021-40654: An information disclosure issue exist in D-LINK-DIR-615 B2 2.01mt.

Invenio-Drafts-Resources prior to versions 0.13.7 and 0.14.6 does not properly check permissions when a record is published. The vulnerability is exploitable in a default installation of InvenioRDM. An authenticated a user is able via REST API calls to publish draft records of other users if they know the record identifier and the draft validates (e.g. all require fields filled out). An attacker is not able to modify the data in the record, and thus e.g. *cannot* change a record from restricted to public. The problem is patched in Invenio-Drafts-Resources v0.13.7 and 0.14.6, which is part of InvenioRDM v6.0.1 and InvenioRDM v7.0 respectively.\n\n- CVE-2020-11628: An issue was discovered in EJBCA before 6.15.2.6 and 7.x before 7.3.1.2. It is intended to support restriction of available remote protocols (CMP, ACME, REST, etc.) through the system configuration. These restrictions can be bypassed by modifying the URI string from a client. (EJBCA's internal access control restrictions are still in place, and each respective protocol must be configured to allow for enrollment.)\n\n- CVE-2020-13263: An authorization issue relating to project maintainer impersonation was identified in GitLab EE 9.5 and later through 13.0.1 that could allow unauthorized users to impersonate as a maintainer to perform limited actions.\n\n- CVE-2020-15126: In parser-server from version 3.5.0 and before 4.3.0, an authenticated user using the viewer GraphQL query can by pass all read security on his User object and can also by pass all objects linked via relation or Pointer on his User object.\n\n- CVE-2020-1725: A flaw was found in keycloak before version 13.0.0. In some scenarios a user still has access to a resource after changing the role mappings in Keycloak and after expiration of the previous access token.\n\n- CVE-2020-1729: A flaw was found in SmallRye's API through version 1.6.1. The API can allow other code running within the application server to potentially obtain the ClassLoader, bypassing any permissions checks that should have been applied. The largest threat from this vulnerability is a threat to data confidentiality. This is fixed in SmallRye 1.6.2\n\n- CVE-2020-25701: If the upload course tool in Moodle was used to delete an enrollment method which did not exist or was not already enabled, the tool would erroneously enable that enrollment method. This could lead to unintended users gaining access to the course. Versions affected: 3.9 to 3.9.2, 3.8 to 3.8.5, 3.7 to 3.7.8, 3.5 to 3.5.14 and earlier unsupported versions. This is fixed in moodle 3.9.3, 3.8.6, 3.7.9, 3.5.15, and 3.10.\n\n- CVE-2020-28397: A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC Drive Controller family (All versions < V2.9.2), SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller CPU 1515SP PC2 (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V21.9), SIMATIC S7 PLCSIM Advanced (All versions > V2 < V4), SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants) (Version V4.4), SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family (incl. related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants) (All versions > V2.5 < V2.9.2), SIMATIC S7-1500 Software Controller (All versions > V2.5 < V21.9), TIM 1531 IRC (incl. SIPLUS NET variants) (Version V2.1). Due to an incorrect authorization check in the affected component, an attacker could extract information about access protected PLC program variables over port 102/tcp from an affected device when reading multiple attributes at once.\n\n- CVE-2020-28872: An authorization bypass vulnerability in Monitorr v1.7.6m in Monitorr/assets/config/_installation/_register.php allows an unauthorized person to create valid credentials.\n\n- CVE-2020-29605: An issue was discovered in MantisBT before 2.24.4. Due to insufficient access-level checks, any logged-in user allowed to perform Group Actions can get access to the Summary fields of private Issues via bug_arr[]= in a crafted bug_actiongroup_page.php URL. (The target Issues can have Private view status, or belong to a private Project.)\n\n- CVE-2021-1144: A vulnerability in Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) could allow a remote, authenticated attacker without administrative privileges to alter the password of any user on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of authorization checks for changing a password. An authenticated attacker without administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability by sending a modified HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the passwords of any user on the system, including an administrative user, and then impersonate that user.\n\n- CVE-2021-1539: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-1540: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-20179: A flaw was found in pki-core. An attacker who has successfully compromised a key could use this flaw to renew the corresponding certificate over and over again, as long as it is not explicitly revoked. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-20188: A flaw was found in podman before 1.7.0. File permissions for non-root users running in a privileged container are not correctly checked. This flaw can be abused by a low-privileged user inside the container to access any other file in the container, even if owned by the root user inside the container. It does not allow to directly escape the container, though being a privileged container means that a lot of security features are disabled when running the container. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-20229: A flaw was found in PostgreSQL in versions before 13.2. This flaw allows a user with SELECT privilege on one column to craft a special query that returns all columns of the table. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20282: When creating a user account, it was possible to verify the account without having access to the verification email link/secret in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2021-21182: Insufficient policy enforcement in navigations in Google Chrome prior to 89.0.4389.72 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-21228: Insufficient policy enforcement in extensions in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.93 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted Chrome Extension.\n\n- CVE-2021-21318: Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of educational audio and video content. In Opencast before version 9.2 there is a vulnerability in which publishing an episode with strict access rules will overwrite the currently set series access. This allows for an easy denial of access for all users without superuser privileges, effectively hiding the series. Access to series and series metadata on the search service (shown in media module and player) depends on the events published which are part of the series. Publishing an event will automatically publish a series and update access to it. Removing an event or republishing the event should do the same. Affected versions of Opencast may not update the series access or remove a published series if an event is being removed. On removal of an episode, this may lead to an access control list for series metadata with broader access rules than the merged access rules of all remaining events, or the series metadata still being available although all episodes of that series have been removed. This problem is fixed in Opencast 9.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-21367: Switchboard Bluetooth Plug for elementary OS from version 2.3.0 and before version version 2.3.5 has an incorrect authorization vulnerability. When the Bluetooth plug is running (in discoverable mode), Bluetooth service requests and pairing requests are automatically accepted, allowing physically proximate attackers to pair with a device running an affected version of switchboard-plug-bluetooth without the active consent of the user. By default, elementary OS doesn't expose any services via Bluetooth that allow information to be extracted by paired Bluetooth devices. However, if such services (i.e. contact list sharing software) have been installed, it's possible that attackers have been able to extract data from such services without authorization. If no such services have been installed, attackers are only able to pair with a device running an affected version without authorization and then play audio out of the device or possibly present a HID device (keyboard, mouse, etc...) to control the device. As such, users should check the list of trusted/paired devices and remove any that are not 100% confirmed to be genuine. This is fixed in version 2.3.5. To reduce the likelihood of this vulnerability on an unpatched version, only open the Bluetooth plug for short intervals when absolutely necessary and preferably not in crowded public areas. To mitigate the risk entirely with unpatched versions, do not open the Bluetooth plug within switchboard at all, and use a different method for pairing devices if necessary (e.g. `bluetoothctl` CLI).\n\n- CVE-2021-21389: BuddyPress is an open source WordPress plugin to build a community site. In releases of BuddyPress from 5.0.0 before 7.2.1 it's possible for a non-privileged, regular user to obtain administrator rights by exploiting an issue in the REST API members endpoint. The vulnerability has been fixed in BuddyPress 7.2.1. Existing installations of the plugin should be updated to this version to mitigate the issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-21411: OAuth2-Proxy is an open source reverse proxy that provides authentication with Google, Github or other providers. The `--gitlab-group` flag for group-based authorization in the GitLab provider stopped working in the v7.0.0 release. Regardless of the flag settings, authorization wasn't restricted. Additionally, any authenticated users had whichever groups were set in `--gitlab-group` added to the new `X-Forwarded-Groups` header to the upstream application. While adding GitLab project based authorization support in #630, a bug was introduced where the user session's groups field was populated with the `--gitlab-group` config entries instead of pulling the individual user's group membership from the GitLab Userinfo endpoint. When the session groups where compared against the allowed groups for authorization, they matched improperly (since both lists were populated with the same data) so authorization was allowed. This impacts GitLab Provider users who relies on group membership for authorization restrictions. Any authenticated users in your GitLab environment can access your applications regardless of `--gitlab-group` membership restrictions. This is patched in v7.1.0. There is no workaround for the Group membership bug. But `--gitlab-project` can be set to use Project membership as the authorization checks instead of groups; it is not broken.\n\n- CVE-2021-21609: Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not correctly match requested URLs to the list of always accessible paths, allowing attackers without Overall/Read permission to access some URLs as if they did have Overall/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21643: Jenkins Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints, allowing attackers with global Job/Configure permission to enumerate system-scoped credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\n- CVE-2021-21670: Jenkins 2.299 and earlier, LTS 2.289.1 and earlier allows users to cancel queue items and abort builds of jobs for which they have Item/Cancel permission even when they do not have Item/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21692: FilePath#renameTo and FilePath#moveAllChildrenTo in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier only check 'read' agent-to-controller access permission on the source path, instead of 'delete'.\n\n- CVE-2021-22251: Improper validation of invited users' email address in GitLab EE affecting all versions since 12.2 allowed projects to add members with email address domain that should be blocked by group settings\n\n- CVE-2021-22389: There is a Permission Control Vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause certain codes to be executed.\n\n- CVE-2021-24244: An AJAX action registered by the WPBakery Page Builder (Visual Composer) Clipboard WordPress plugin before 4.5.8 did not have capability checks, allowing low privilege users, such as subscribers, to update the license options (key, email).\n\n- CVE-2021-24278: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, unauthenticated users can use the wpcf7r_get_nonce AJAX action to retrieve a valid nonce for any WordPress action/function.\n\n- CVE-2021-24279: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, low level users, such as subscribers, could use the import_from_debug AJAX action to install any plugin from the WordPress repository.\n\n- CVE-2021-24281: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the delete_action_post AJAX action to delete any post on a target site.\n\n- CVE-2021-24282: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the various AJAX actions in the plugin to do a variety of things. For example, an attacker could use wpcf7r_reset_settings to reset the plugin\u2019s settings, wpcf7r_add_action to add actions to a form, and more.\n\n- CVE-2021-24379: The Comments Like Dislike WordPress plugin before 1.1.4 allows users to like/dislike posted comments, however does not prevent them from replaying the AJAX request to add a like. This allows any user (even unauthenticated) to add unlimited like/dislike to any comment. The plugin appears to have some Restriction modes, such as Cookie Restriction, IP Restrictions, Logged In User Restriction, however, they do not prevent such attack as they only check client side\n\n- CVE-2021-24652: The PostX \u2013 Gutenberg Blocks for Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.4.10 performs incorrect checks before allowing any logged in user to perform some ajax based requests, allowing any user to modify, delete or add ultp_options values.\n\n- CVE-2021-24717: The AutomatorWP WordPress plugin before 1.7.6 does not perform capability checks which allows users with Subscriber roles to enumerate automations, disclose title of private posts or user emails, call functions, or perform privilege escalation via Ajax actions.\n\n- CVE-2021-24742: The Logo Slider and Showcase WordPress plugin before 1.3.37 allows Editor users to update the plugin's settings via the rtWLSSettings AJAX action because it uses a nonce for authorisation instead of a capability check.\n\n- CVE-2021-24757: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.0 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users), which could allow unauthenticated users to upload images.\n\n- CVE-2021-24770: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.1 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to authenticated users), which could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber, to upload arbitrary images.\n\n- CVE-2021-25777: In JetBrains TeamCity before 2020.2.1, permissions during token removal were checked improperly.\n\n- CVE-2021-25954: In \u201cDolibarr\u201d application, 2.8.1 to 13.0.4 don\u2019t restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor. A low privileged attacker can modify the Private Note which only an administrator has rights to do, the affected field is at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint.\n\n- CVE-2021-26040: An issue was discovered in Joomla! 4.0.0. The media manager does not correctly check the user's permissions before executing a file deletion command.\n\n- CVE-2021-26563: Incorrect authorization vulnerability in synoagentregisterd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.4-25553 allows local users to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2021-28661: Default SilverStripe GraphQL Server (aka silverstripe/graphql) 3.x through 3.4.1 permission checker not inherited by query subclass.\n\n- CVE-2021-28696: IOMMU page mapping issues on x86 T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Both AMD and Intel allow ACPI tables to specify regions of memory which should be left untranslated, which typically means these addresses should pass the translation phase unaltered. While these are typically device specific ACPI properties, they can also be specified to apply to a range of devices, or even all devices. On all systems with such regions Xen failed to prevent guests from undoing/replacing such mappings (CVE-2021-28694). On AMD systems, where a discontinuous range is specified by firmware, the supposedly-excluded middle range will also be identity-mapped (CVE-2021-28695). Further, on AMD systems, upon de-assigment of a physical device from a guest, the identity mappings would be left in place, allowing a guest continued access to ranges of memory which it shouldn't have access to anymore (CVE-2021-28696).\n\n- CVE-2021-29439: The Grav admin plugin prior to version 1.10.11 does not correctly verify caller's privileges. As a consequence, users with the permission `admin.login` can install third-party plugins and their dependencies. By installing the right plugin, an attacker can obtain an arbitrary code execution primitive and elevate their privileges on the instance. The vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.10.11. As a mitigation blocking access to the `/admin` path from untrusted sources will reduce the probability of exploitation. \n\n- CVE-2021-29943: When using ConfigurableInternodeAuthHadoopPlugin for authentication, Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2 would forward/proxy distributed requests using server credentials instead of original client credentials. This would result in incorrect authorization resolution on the receiving hosts.\n\n- CVE-2021-30533: Insufficient policy enforcement in PopupBlocker in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted iframe.\n\n- CVE-2021-30534: Insufficient policy enforcement in iFrameSandbox in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31158: In the Query Engine in Couchbase Server 6.5.x and 6.6.x through 6.6.1, Common Table Expression queries were not correctly checking the user's permissions, allowing read-access to resources beyond what those users were explicitly allowed to access.\n\n- CVE-2021-31926: AMP Application Deployment Service in CubeCoders AMP 2.1.x before 2.1.1.2 allows a remote, authenticated user to open ports in the local system firewall by crafting an HTTP(S) request directly to the applicable API endpoint (despite not having permission to make changes to the system's network configuration).\n\n- CVE-2021-33718: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 7 (All versions < V7.23.22), Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.7), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.3.0). Write access checks of attributes of an object could be bypassed, if user has a write permissions to the first attribute of this object.\n\n- CVE-2021-34434: In Eclipse Mosquitto versions 2.0 to 2.0.11, when using the dynamic security plugin, if the ability for a client to make subscriptions on a topic is revoked when a durable client is offline, then existing subscriptions for that client are not revoked.\n\n- CVE-2021-35949: The shareinfo controller in the ownCloud Server before 10.8.0 allows an attacker to bypass the permission checks for upload only shares and list metadata about the share.\n\n- CVE-2021-36132: An issue was discovered in the FileImporter extension in MediaWiki through 1.36. For certain relaxed configurations of the $wgFileImporterRequiredRight variable, it might not validate all appropriate user rights, thus allowing a user with insufficient rights to perform operations (specifically file uploads) that they should not be allowed to perform.\n\n- CVE-2021-36230: HashiCorp Terraform Enterprise releases up to v202106-1 did not properly perform authorization checks on a subset of API requests executed using the run token, allowing privilege escalation to organization owner. Fixed in v202107-1.\n\n- CVE-2021-38312: The Gutenberg Template Library & Redux Framework plugin <= 4.2.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check in the REST API endpoints registered under the \u201credux/v1/templates/\u201d REST Route in \u201credux-templates/classes/class-api.php\u201d. The `permissions_callback` used in this file only checked for the `edit_posts` capability which is granted to lower-privileged users such as contributors, allowing such users to install arbitrary plugins from the WordPress repository and edit arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-38345: The Brizy Page Builder plugin <= 2.3.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check that allowed any logged-in user accessing any endpoint in the wp-admin directory to modify the content of any existing post or page created with the Brizy editor. An identical issue was found by another researcher in Brizy <= 1.0.125 and fixed in version 1.0.126, but the vulnerability was reintroduced in version 1.0.127.\n\n- CVE-2021-39321: Version 3.3.23 of the Sassy Social Share WordPress plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection via the wp_ajax_heateor_sss_import_config AJAX action due to deserialization of unvalidated user supplied inputs via the import_config function found in the ~/admin/class-sassy-social-share-admin.php file. This can be exploited by underprivileged authenticated users due to a missing capability check on the import_config function.\n\n- CVE-2021-39902: Incorrect Authorization in GitLab CE/EE 13.4 or above allows a user with guest membership in a project to modify the severity of an incident.\n\n- CVE-2021-41082: Discourse is a platform for community discussion. In affected versions any private message that includes a group had its title and participating user exposed to users that do not have access to the private messages. However, access control for the private messages was not compromised as users were not able to view the posts in the leaked private message despite seeing it in their inbox. The problematic commit was reverted around 32 minutes after it was made. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest commit if they are running Discourse against the `tests-passed` branch.\n\n- CVE-2021-41189: DSpace is an open source turnkey repository application. In version 7.0, any community or collection administrator can escalate their permission up to become system administrator. This vulnerability only exists in 7.0 and does not impact 6.x or below. This issue is patched in version 7.1. As a workaround, users of 7.0 may temporarily disable the ability for community or collection administrators to manage permissions or workflows settings.\n\n- CVE-2021-41230: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. In affected versions changes to the OIDC claims of a user after initial login are not reflected in policy evaluation when using `allowed_idp_claims` as part of policy. If using `allowed_idp_claims` and a user's claims are changed, Pomerium can make incorrect authorization decisions. This issue has been resolved in v0.15.6. For users unable to upgrade clear data on `databroker` service by clearing redis or restarting the in-memory databroker to force claims to be updated.\n\n- CVE-2021-42025: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control write access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to manipulate the content of System.FileDocument objects in some cases, regardless whether they have write access to it.\n\n- CVE-2021-42026: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control read access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to retrieve the changedDate attribute of arbitrary objects, even when they don't have read access to them.\n\n- CVE-2021-43553: PI Vision could disclose information to a user with insufficient privileges for an AF attribute that is the child of another attribute and is configured as a Limits property.\n\n- CVE-2021-29959: When a user has already allowed a website to access microphone and camera, disabling camera sharing would not fully prevent the website from re-enabling it without an additional prompt. This was only possible if the website kept recording with the microphone until re-enabling the camera. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.\n\n- CVE-2021-32701: ORY Oathkeeper is an Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) and Access Control Decision API that authorizes HTTP requests based on sets of Access Rules. When you make a request to an endpoint that requires the scope `foo` using an access token granted with that `foo` scope, introspection will be valid and that token will be cached. The problem comes when a second requests to an endpoint that requires the scope `bar` is made before the cache has expired. Whether the token is granted or not to the `bar` scope, introspection will be valid. A patch will be released with `v0.38.12-beta.1`. Per default, caching is disabled for the `oauth2_introspection` authenticator. When caching is disabled, this vulnerability does not exist. The cache is checked in [`func (a *AuthenticatorOAuth2Introspection) Authenticate(...)`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L152). From [`tokenFromCache()`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L97) it seems that it only validates the token expiration date, but ignores whether the token has or not the proper scopes. The vulnerability was introduced in PR #424. During review, we failed to require appropriate test coverage by the submitter which is the primary reason that the vulnerability passed the review process.\n\n- CVE-2021-20538: IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S) 1.5.0.0 and 1.5.0.1 could allow a user to obtain sensitive information or perform actions they should not have access to due to incorrect authorization mechanisms. IBM X-Force ID: 198919.\n\n- CVE-2021-40504: A certain template role in SAP NetWeaver Application Server for ABAP and ABAP Platform - versions 700, 701, 702, 710, 711, 730, 731, 740, 750, 751, 752, 753, 754, 755, 756, contains transport authorizations, which exceed expected display only permissions.\n\n- CVE-2021-25356: An improper caller check vulnerability in Managed Provisioning prior to SMR APR-2021 Release 1 allows unprivileged application to install arbitrary application, grant device admin permission and then delete several installed application.\n\n- CVE-2021-24783: The Post Expirator WordPress plugin before 2.6.0 does not have proper capability checks in place, which could allow users with a role as low as Contributor to schedule deletion of arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-26753: NeDi 1.9C allows an authenticated user to inject PHP code in the System Files function on the endpoint /System-Files.php via the txt HTTP POST parameter. This allows an attacker to obtain access to the operating system where NeDi is installed and to all application data.\n\n- CVE-2021-32829: ZStack is open source IaaS(infrastructure as a service) software aiming to automate datacenters, managing resources of compute, storage, and networking all by APIs. Affected versions of ZStack REST API are vulnerable to post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) via bypass of the Groovy shell sandbox. The REST API exposes the GET zstack/v1/batch-queries?script endpoint which is backed up by the BatchQueryAction class. Messages are represented by the APIBatchQueryMsg, dispatched to the QueryFacadeImpl facade and handled by the BatchQuery class. The HTTP request parameter script is mapped to the APIBatchQueryMsg.script property and evaluated as a Groovy script in BatchQuery.query the evaluation of the user-controlled Groovy script is sandboxed by SandboxTransformer which will apply the restrictions defined in the registered (sandbox.register()) GroovyInterceptor. Even though the sandbox heavily restricts the receiver types to a small set of allowed types, the sandbox is non effective at controlling any code placed in Java annotations and therefore vulnerable to meta-programming escapes. This issue leads to post-authenticated remote code execution. For more details see the referenced GHSL-2021-065. This issue is patched in versions 3.8.21, 3.10.8, and 4.1.0.\n\n- CVE-2020-9381: controllers/admin.js in Total.js CMS 13 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a POST to the /admin/api/widgets/ URI. This can be exploited in conjunction with CVE-2019-15954.\n\n- CVE-2021-26027: An issue was discovered in Joomla! 3.0.0 through 3.9.24. Incorrect ACL checks could allow unauthorized change of the category for an article.\n\n- CVE-2021-36749: In the Druid ingestion system, the InputSource is used for reading data from a certain data source. However, the HTTP InputSource allows authenticated users to read data from other sources than intended, such as the local file system, with the privileges of the Druid server process. This is not an elevation of privilege when users access Druid directly, since Druid also provides the Local InputSource, which allows the same level of access. But it is problematic when users interact with Druid indirectly through an application that allows users to specify the HTTP InputSource, but not the Local InputSource. In this case, users could bypass the application-level restriction by passing a file URL to the HTTP InputSource.

In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the name, avatar, topic and number of members of a room if they know the ID of the room. This vulnerability is limited to homeservers where the vulnerable homeserver is in the room and untrusted users are permitted to create groups (communities). By default, only homeserver administrators can create groups. However, homeserver administrators can already access this information in the database or using the admin API. As a result, only homeservers where the configuration setting `enable_group_creation` has been set to `true` are impacted. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or higher to patch the vulnerability. There are two potential workarounds. Server administrators can set `enable_group_creation` to `false` in their homeserver configuration (this is the default value) to prevent creation of groups by non-administrators. Administrators that are using a reverse proxy could, with partial loss of group functionality, block the endpoints `/_matrix/client/r0/groups/{group_id}/rooms` and `/_matrix/client/unstable/groups/{group_id}/rooms`.\n\n- CVE-2021-39164: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP.

The vulnerability is limited to rooms with `shared` history visibility. Furthermore, the unauthorised user must be using an account on a vulnerable homeserver that is in the room. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or later in order to receive the patch. One workaround is available. Administrators of servers that use a reverse proxy could, with potentially unacceptable loss of functionality, block the endpoints: `/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter, and `/_matrix/client/unstable/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-0472: In shouldLockKeyguard of LockTaskController.java, there is a possible way to exit App Pinning without a PIN due to a permissions bypass.

An unauthenticated user can gain read-only access to XCC in such a configuration, thereby allowing the XCC device configuration to be viewed but not changed. XCC devices configured to use local authentication, LDAP Authentication + Authorization Mode, or LDAP servers that support only \u201cauthenticated bind\u201d and/or \u201canonymous bind\u201d are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-1983: Incorrect authorization in GitLab EE affecting all versions from 10.7 prior to 14.10.5, 15.0 prior to 15.0.4, and 15.1 prior to 15.1.1, allowed an attacker already in possession of a valid Deploy Key or a Deploy Token to misuse it from any location to access Container Registries even when IP address restrictions were configured.\n\n- CVE-2022-29271: In Nagios XI through 5.8.5, a read-only Nagios user (due to an incorrect permission check) is able to schedule downtime for any host/services. This allows an attacker to permanently disable all monitoring checks.\n\n- CVE-2022-34782: An incorrect permission check in Jenkins requests-plugin Plugin 2.2.16 and earlier allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to view the list of pending requests.\n\n- CVE-2022-3819: An improper authorization issue in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 15.0 prior to 15.3.5, 15.4 prior to 15.4.4, and 15.5 prior to 15.5.2 allows a malicious users to set emojis on internal notes they don't have access to.\n\n- CVE-2022-40816: Zammad 5.2.1 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control. Zammad's asset handling mechanism has logic to ensure that customer users are not able to see personal information of other users. This logic was not effective when used through a web socket connection, so that a logged-in attacker would be able to fetch personal data of other users by querying the Zammad API. This issue is fixed in , 5.2.2.\n\n- CVE-2022-45383: An incorrect permission check in Jenkins Support Core Plugin 1206.v14049fa_b_d860 and earlier allows attackers with Support/DownloadBundle permission to download a previously created support bundle containing information limited to users with Overall/Administer permission.\n\n- CVE-2022-46076: D-Link DIR-869 DIR869Ax_FW102B15 is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass via phpcgi.\n\n- CVE-2021-24917: The WPS Hide Login WordPress plugin before 1.9.1 has a bug which allows to get the secret login page by setting a random referer string and making a request to /wp-admin/options.php as an unauthenticated user.\n\n- CVE-2022-1746: The authentication mechanism used by poll workers to administer voting using the tested version of Dominion Voting Systems ImageCast X can expose cryptographic secrets used to protect election information.

PAM auth fails to reject locked accounts, which allows a previously authorized user whose account is locked still run Salt commands when their account is locked. This affects both local shell accounts with an active session and salt-api users that authenticate via PAM eauth.\n\n- CVE-2022-23822: In this physical attack, an attacker may potentially exploit the Zynq-7000 SoC First Stage Boot Loader (FSBL) by bypassing authentication and loading a malicious image onto the device. This in turn may further allow the attacker to perform additional attacks such as such as using the device as a decryption oracle. An anticipated mitigation via a 2022.1 patch will resolve the issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-24778: The imgcrypt library provides API exensions for containerd to support encrypted container images and implements the ctd-decoder command line tool for use by containerd to decrypt encrypted container images. The imgcrypt function `CheckAuthorization` is supposed to check whether the current used is authorized to access an encrypted image and prevent the user from running an image that another user previously decrypted on the same system. In versions prior to 1.1.4, a failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. Only the first architecture in the list was tested, which may not have its layers available locally since it could not be run on the host architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However, this verdict to allow the image to run enabled other architectures in the ManifestList to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted. A patch has been applied to imgcrypt 1.1.4. Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.\n\n- CVE-2022-33174: Power Distribution Units running on Powertek firmware (multiple brands) before 3.30.30 allows remote authorization bypass in the web interface. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must send an HTTP packet to the data retrieval interface (/cgi/get_param.cgi) with the tmpToken cookie set to an empty string followed by a semicolon. This bypasses an active session authorization check. This can be then used to fetch the values of protected sys.passwd and sys.su.name fields that contain the username and password in cleartext.\n\n- CVE-2021-22240: Improper access control in GitLab EE versions 13.11.6, 13.12.6, and 14.0.2 allows users to be created via single sign on despite user cap being enabled\n\n- CVE-2021-35112: A user with user level permission can access graphics protected region due to improper access control in register configuration in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-37409: Improper access control for some Intel(R) PROSet/Wireless WiFi and Killer(TM) WiFi products may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\n\n- CVE-2022-0574: Improper Access Control in GitHub repository publify/publify prior to 9.2.8.\n\n- CVE-2022-1944: When the feature is configured, improper authorization in the Interactive Web Terminal in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 11.3 prior to 14.9.5, 14.10 prior to 14.10.4, and 15.0 prior to 15.0.1 allows users with the Developer role to open terminals on other Developers' running jobs\n\n- CVE-2022-2095: An improper access control check in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 13.7 before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1 allows a malicious authenticated user to view a public project's Deploy Key's public fingerprint and name when that key has write permission. Note that GitLab never asks for nor stores the private key.\n\n- CVE-2022-23488: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4-rc-6 are vulnerable to Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data. The moderators-only webcams lock setting is not enforced on the backend, which allows an attacker to subscribe to viewers' webcams, even when the lock setting is applied. (The required streamId was being sent to all users even with lock setting applied). This issue is fixed in version 2.4-rc-6. There are no workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-0406: Improper Authorization in GitHub repository janeczku/calibre-web prior to 0.6.16.\n\n- CVE-2022-35921: fof/byobu is a private discussions extension for Flarum forum. Affected versions were found to not respect private discussion disablement by users. Users of Byobu should update the extension to version 1.1.7, where this has been patched. Users of Byobu with Flarum 1.0 or 1.1 should upgrade to Flarum 1.2 or later, or evaluate the impact this issue has on your forum's users and choose to disable the extension if needed. There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-41923: Grails Spring Security Core plugin is vulnerable to privilege escalation. The vulnerability allows an attacker access to one endpoint (i.e. the targeted endpoint) using the authorization requirements of a different endpoint (i.e. the donor endpoint). In some Grails framework applications, access to the targeted endpoint will be granted based on meeting the authorization requirements of the donor endpoint, which can result in a privilege escalation attack. This vulnerability has been patched in grails-spring-security-core versions 3.3.2, 4.0.5 and 5.1.1. Impacted Applications: Grails Spring Security Core plugin versions: 1.x 2.x >=3.0.0 <3.3.2 >=4.0.0 <4.0.5 >=5.0.0 <5.1.1 We strongly suggest that all Grails framework applications using the Grails Spring Security Core plugin be updated to a patched release of the plugin. Workarounds: Users should create a subclass extending one of the following classes from the `grails.plugin.springsecurity.web.access.intercept` package, depending on their security configuration: * `AnnotationFilterInvocationDefinition` * `InterceptUrlMapFilterInvocationDefinition` * `RequestmapFilterInvocationDefinition` In each case, the subclass should override the `calculateUri` method like so: ``` @Override protected String calculateUri(HttpServletRequest request) { UrlPathHelper.defaultInstance.getRequestUri(request) } ``` This should be considered a temporary measure, as the patched versions of grails-spring-security-core deprecates the `calculateUri` method. Once upgraded to a patched version of the plugin, this workaround is no longer needed. The workaround is especially important for version 2.x, as no patch is available version 2.x of the GSSC plugin.\n\n- CVE-2022-0580: Incorrect Authorization in Packagist librenms/librenms prior to 22.2.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-1223: Incorrect Authorization in GitHub repository phpipam/phpipam prior to 1.4.6. \n\n- CVE-2022-0117: Policy bypass in Blink in Google Chrome prior to 97.0.4692.71 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-0334: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions.

IBM X-Force ID: 231360.\n\n- CVE-2022-2408: The Guest account feature in Mattermost version 6.7.0 and earlier fails to properly restrict the permissions, which allows a guest user to fetch a list of all public channels in the team, in spite of not being part of those channels.\n\n- CVE-2022-0985: Insufficient capability checks could allow users with the moodle/site:uploadusers capability to delete users, without having the necessary moodle/user:delete capability.\n\n- CVE-2022-1460: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 9.2 before 14.8.6, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.4, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.1. GitLab was not performing correct authorizations on scheduled pipelines allowing a malicious user to run a pipeline in the context of another user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24748: Shopware is an open commerce platform based on the Symfony php Framework and the Vue javascript framework. In versions prior to 6.4.8.2 it is possible to modify customers and to create orders without App Permission. This issue is a result of improper api route checking. Users are advised to upgrade to version 6.4.8.2. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-25335: RigoBlock Dragos through 2022-02-17 lacks the onlyOwner modifier for setMultipleAllowances. This enables token manipulation, as exploited in the wild in February 2022. NOTE: although 2022-02-17 is the vendor's vulnerability announcement date, the vulnerability will not be remediated until a major protocol upgrade occurs.\n\n- CVE-2022-36103: Talos Linux is a Linux distribution built for Kubernetes deployments. Talos worker nodes use a join token to get accepted into the Talos cluster. Due to improper validation of the request while signing a worker node CSR (certificate signing request) Talos control plane node might issue Talos API certificate which allows full access to Talos API on a control plane node. Accessing Talos API with full level access on a control plane node might reveal sensitive information which allows full level access to the cluster (Kubernetes and Talos PKI, etc.). Talos API join token is stored in the machine configuration on the worker node. When configured correctly, Kubernetes workloads don't have access to the machine configuration, but due to a misconfiguration workload might access the machine configuration and reveal the join token. This problem has been fixed in Talos 1.2.2. Enabling the Pod Security Standards mitigates the vulnerability by denying hostPath mounts and host networking by default in the baseline policy. Clusters that don't run untrusted workloads are not affected. Clusters with correct Pod Security configurations which don't allow hostPath mounts, and secure access to cloud metadata server (or machine configuration is not supplied via cloud metadata server) are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-46792: Hasura GraphQL Engine before 2.15.2 mishandles row-level authorization in the Update Many API for Postgres backends. The fixed versions are 2.10.2, 2.11.3, 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.1, and 2.15.2. (Versions before 2.10.0 are unaffected.)\n\n- CVE-2022-3048: Inappropriate implementation in Chrome OS lockscreen in Google Chrome on Chrome OS prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a local attacker to bypass lockscreen navigation restrictions via physical access to the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-30538: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-30539: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31876: Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 through 0.21.1 does not properly implement the replacement policy specified in BIP125, which makes it easier for attackers to trigger a loss of funds, or a denial of service attack against downstream projects such as Lightning network nodes. An unconfirmed child transaction with nSequence = 0xff_ff_ff_ff, spending an unconfirmed parent with nSequence <= 0xff_ff_ff_fd, should be replaceable because there is inherited signaling by the child transaction. However, the actual PreChecks implementation does not enforce this. Instead, mempool rejects the replacement attempt of the unconfirmed child transaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-3763: A flaw was found in the Red Hat AMQ Broker management console in version 7.8 where an existing user is able to access some limited information even when the role the user is assigned to should not be allow access to the management console. The main impact is to confidentiality as this flaw means some role bindings are incorrectly checked, some privileged meta information such as queue names and configuration details are disclosed but the impact is limited as not all information is accessible and there is no affect to integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-39206: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, contains two authorization related vulnerabilities CVE-2021-32777 and CVE-2021-32779. This may lead to incorrect routing or authorization policy decisions. With specially crafted requests, incorrect authorization or routing decisions may be made by Pomerium. Pomerium v0.14.8 and v0.15.1 contain an upgraded envoy binary with these vulnerabilities patched. This issue can only be triggered when using path prefix based policy. Removing any such policies should provide mitigation.\n\n- CVE-2022-0333: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions. The calendar:manageentries capability allowed managers to access or modify any calendar event, but should have been restricted from accessing user level events.\n\n- CVE-2022-0633: The UpdraftPlus WordPress plugin Free before 1.22.3 and Premium before 2.22.3 do not properly validate a user has the required privileges to access a backup's nonce identifier, which may allow any users with an account on the site (such as subscriber) to download the most recent site & database backup.\n\n- CVE-2022-0740: Incorrect authorization in the Asana integration's branch restriction feature in all versions of GitLab CE/EE starting from version 7.8.0 before 14.7.7, all versions starting from 14.8 before 14.8.5, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.2 makes it possible to close Asana tasks from unrestricted branches.\n\n- CVE-2022-0825: The Amelia WordPress plugin before 1.0.49 does not have proper authorisation when managing appointments, allowing any customer to update other's booking status, as well as retrieve sensitive information about the bookings, such as the full name and phone number of the person who booked it.\n\n- CVE-2022-1935: Incorrect authorization in GitLab EE affecting all versions from 12.0 before 14.9.5, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.4, all versions starting from 15.0 before 15.0.1 allowed an attacker already in possession of a valid Project Trigger Token to misuse it from any location even when IP address restrictions were configured\n\n- CVE-2022-1936: Incorrect authorization in GitLab EE affecting all versions from 12.0 before 14.9.5, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.4, all versions starting from 15.0 before 15.0.1 allowed an attacker already in possession of a valid Project Deploy Token to misuse it from any location even when IP address restrictions were configured\n\n- CVE-2022-1981: An issue has been discovered in GitLab EE affecting all versions starting from 12.2 prior to 14.10.5, 15.0 prior to 15.0.4, and 15.1 prior to 15.1.1. In GitLab, if a group enables the setting to restrict access to users belonging to specific domains, that allow-list may be bypassed if a Maintainer uses the 'Invite a group' feature to invite a group that has members that don't comply with domain allow-list.\n\n- CVE-2022-21701: Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. In versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 Istio is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. Users who have `CREATE` permission for `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` objects can escalate this privilege to create other resources that they may not have access to, such as `Pod`. This vulnerability impacts only an Alpha level feature, the Kubernetes Gateway API. This is not the same as the Istio Gateway type (gateways.networking.istio.io), which is not vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade should implement any of the following which will prevent this vulnerability: Remove the gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io CustomResourceDefinition, set PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER=true environment variable in Istiod, or remove CREATE permissions for gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io objects from untrusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-22326: IBM Datapower Gateway 10.0.2.0 through 10.0.4.0, 10.0.1.0 through 10.0.1.5, and 2018.4.1.0 through 2018.4.1.18 could allow unauthorized viewing of logs and files due to insufficient authorization checks. IBM X-Force ID: 218856.\n\n- CVE-2022-23490: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4.0 expose sensitive information to Unauthorized Actors. This issue affects meetings with polls, where the attacker is a meeting participant. Subscribing to the current-poll collection does not update the client UI, but does give the attacker access to the contents of the collection, which include the individual poll responses. This issue is patched in version 2.4.0. There are no workarounds. \n\n- CVE-2022-23615: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions any user with SCRIPT right can save a document with the right of the current user which allow accessing API requiring programming right if the current user has programming right. This has been patched in XWiki 13.0. Users are advised to update to resolve this issue. The only known workaround is to limit SCRIPT access.\n\n- CVE-2022-23627: ArchiSteamFarm (ASF) is a C# application with primary purpose of idling Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug in ASF code, introduced in version V5.2.2.2, the program didn't adequately verify effective access of the user sending proxy (i.e. `[Bots]`) commands. In particular, a proxy-like command sent to bot `A` targeting bot `B` has incorrectly verified user's access against bot `A` - instead of bot `B`, to which the command was originally designated. This in result allowed access to resources beyond those configured, being a security threat affecting confidentiality of other bot instances. A successful attack exploiting this bug requires a significant access granted explicitly by original owner of the ASF process prior to that, as attacker has to control at least a single bot in the process to make use of this inadequate access verification loophole. The issue is patched in ASF V5.2.2.5, V5.2.3.2 and future versions. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2022-23739: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server, allowing for escalation of privileges in GraphQL API requests from GitHub Apps. This vulnerability allowed an app installed on an organization to gain access to and modify most organization-level resources that are not tied to a repository regardless of granted permissions, such as users and organization-wide projects. Resources associated with repositories were not impacted, such as repository file content, repository-specific projects, issues, or pull requests. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.7.1 and was fixed in versions 3.3.16, 3.4.11, 3.5.8, 3.6.4, 3.7.1. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.\n\n- CVE-2022-23741: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a scoped user-to-server token to escalate to full admin/owner privileges.

Installations of Icinga 2 with the IDO writer enabled are affected. If you use service custom variables in role restrictions, and you regularly decommission service objects, users with said roles may still have access to a collection of content. Note that this only applies if a role has implicitly permitted access to hosts, due to permitted access to at least one of their services. If access to a host is permitted by other means, no sensible information has been disclosed to unauthorized users. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2.\n\n- CVE-2022-24721: CometD is a scalable comet implementation for web messaging. In any version prior to 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6, internal usage of Oort and Seti channels is improperly authorized, so any remote user could subscribe and publish to those channels. By subscribing to those channels, a remote user may be able to watch cluster-internal traffic that contains other users' (possibly sensitive) data. By publishing to those channels, a remote user may be able to create/modify/delete other user's data and modify the cluster structure. A fix is available in versions 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6. As a workaround, install a custom `SecurityPolicy` that forbids subscription and publishing to remote, non-Oort, sessions on Oort and Seti channels.\n\n- CVE-2022-2597: The Visual Portfolio, Photo Gallery & Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.19.0 does not have proper authorisation checks in some of its REST endpoints, allowing users with a role as low as contributor to call them and inject arbitrary CSS in arbitrary saved layouts\n\n- CVE-2022-26767: The issue was addressed with additional permissions checks.

In affected versions an attacker can view any room's settings even though they are not authorized to do so. Only the room owner and administrator should be able to view a room's settings. This issue has been patched in release version 2.12.6.\n\n- CVE-2022-31107: Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In versions 5.3 until 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10, it is possible for a malicious user who has authorization to log into a Grafana instance via a configured OAuth IdP which provides a login name to take over the account of another user in that Grafana instance. This can occur when the malicious user is authorized to log in to Grafana via OAuth, the malicious user's external user id is not already associated with an account in Grafana, the malicious user's email address is not already associated with an account in Grafana, and the malicious user knows the Grafana username of the target user. If these conditions are met, the malicious user can set their username in the OAuth provider to that of the target user, then go through the OAuth flow to log in to Grafana. Due to the way that external and internal user accounts are linked together during login, if the conditions above are all met then the malicious user will be able to log in to the target user's Grafana account. Versions 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, concerned users can disable OAuth login to their Grafana instance, or ensure that all users authorized to log in via OAuth have a corresponding user account in Grafana linked to their email address.\n\n- CVE-2022-31155: Sourcegraph is an opensource code search and navigation engine. In Sourcegraph versions before 3.41.0, it is possible for an attacker to delete other users\u2019 saved searches due to a bug in the authorization check. The vulnerability does not allow the reading of other users\u2019 saved searches, only overwriting them with attacker-controlled searches. The issue is patched in Sourcegraph version 3.41.0. There is no workaround for this issue and updating to a secure version is highly recommended.\n\n- CVE-2022-31168: Zulip is an open source team chat tool. Due to an incorrect authorization check in Zulip Server 5.4 and earlier, a member of an organization could craft an API call that grants organization administrator privileges to one of their bots. The vulnerability is fixed in Zulip Server 5.5. Members who don\u2019t own any bots, and lack permission to create them, can\u2019t exploit the vulnerability. As a workaround for the vulnerability, an organization administrator can restrict the `Who can create bots` permission to administrators only, and change the ownership of existing bots.\n\n- CVE-2022-39214: Combodo iTop is an open source, web-based IT service management platform. Prior to versions 2.7.8 and 3.0.2-1, a user who can log in on iTop is able to take over any account just by knowing the account's username. This issue is fixed in versions 2.7.8 and 3.0.2-1.\n\n- CVE-2022-39302: Ree6 is a moderation bot. This vulnerability would allow other server owners to create configurations such as \"Better-Audit-Logging\" which contain a channel from another server as a target.

JDPI incorrectly classifies out-of-state asymmetric TCP flows as the dynamic-application INCONCLUSIVE instead of UNKNOWN, which is more permissive, causing the firewall to allow traffic to be forwarded that should have been denied. This issue only occurs when 'set security flow tcp-session no-syn-check' is configured on the device. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S9, 18.4R3-S9; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S3, 19.1R3-S6; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S7, 19.2R3-S3; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S5, 19.4R3-S3; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S2, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S1; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-S1, 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R1-S1, 21.1R2.

While JDPI correctly classifies out-of-state asymmetric TCP flows as the dynamic-application UNKNOWN, this classification is not provided to the policy module properly and hence traffic continues to use the pre-id-default-policy, which is more permissive, causing the firewall to allow traffic to be forwarded that should have been denied. This issue only occurs when 'set security flow tcp-session no-syn-check' is configured on the device. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S10, 18.4R3-S10; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S8; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S8, 19.2R3-S4; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S5; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S1; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S2; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S1; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-S2, 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2-S2, 21.1R3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R2.

There are no workarounds available.\n\n- CVE-2022-42724: app/Controller/UsersController.php in MISP before 2.4.164 allows attackers to discover role names (this is information that only the site admin should have).\n\n- CVE-2021-41571: In Apache Pulsar it is possible to access data from BookKeeper that does not belong to the topics accessible by the authenticated user. The Admin API get-message-by-id requires the user to input a topic and a ledger id. The ledger id is a pointer to the data, and it is supposed to be a valid it for the topic. Authorisation controls are performed against the topic name and there is not proper validation the that ledger id is valid in the context of such ledger. So it may happen that the user is able to read from a ledger that contains data owned by another tenant. This issue affects Apache Pulsar Apache Pulsar version 2.8.0 and prior versions; Apache Pulsar version 2.7.3 and prior versions; Apache Pulsar version 2.6.4 and prior versions.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-285 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",

In affected versions of Redis an integer overflow bug in 32-bit Redis version 4.0 or newer could be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. Redis 4.0 or newer uses a configurable limit for the maximum supported bulk input size. By default, it is 512MB which is a safe value for all platforms. If the limit is significantly increased, receiving a large request from a client may trigger several integer overflow scenarios, which would result with buffer overflow and heap corruption. We believe this could in certain conditions be exploited for remote code execution. By default, authenticated Redis users have access to all configuration parameters and can therefore use the \u201cCONFIG SET proto-max-bulk-len\u201d to change the safe default, making the system vulnerable. **This problem only affects 32-bit Redis (on a 32-bit system, or as a 32-bit executable running on a 64-bit system).** The problem is fixed in version 6.2, and the fix is back ported to 6.0.11 and 5.0.11. Make sure you use one of these versions if you are running 32-bit Redis. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent clients from directly executing `CONFIG SET`: Using Redis 6.0 or newer, ACL configuration can be used to block the command. Using older versions, the `rename-command` configuration directive can be used to rename the command to a random string unknown to users, rendering it inaccessible. Please note that this workaround may have an additional impact on users or operational systems that expect `CONFIG SET` to behave in certain ways.\n\n- CVE-2021-21807: An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the DICOM parse_dicom_meta_info functionality of Accusoft ImageGear 19.9.

An integer overflow bug in Redis version 6.0 or newer, could be exploited using the STRALGO LCS command to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. This is a result of an incomplete fix by CVE-2021-29477. The problem is fixed in version 6.2.4 and 6.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to use ACL configuration to prevent clients from using the STRALGO LCS command. On 64 bit systems which have the fixes of CVE-2021-29477 (6.2.3 or 6.0.13), it is sufficient to make sure that the proto-max-bulk-len config parameter is smaller than 2GB (default is 512MB).\n\n- CVE-2021-32628: Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. An integer overflow bug in the ziplist data structure used by all versions of Redis can be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. The vulnerability involves modifying the default ziplist configuration parameters (hash-max-ziplist-entries, hash-max-ziplist-value, zset-max-ziplist-entries or zset-max-ziplist-value) to a very large value, and then constructing specially crafted commands to create very large ziplists. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16, 5.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from modifying the above configuration parameters. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.\n\n- CVE-2021-34385: Trusty TLK contains a vulnerability in the NVIDIA TLK kernel where an integer overflow in the calculation of a length could lead to a heap overflow.\n\n- CVE-2021-34386: Trusty TLK contains a vulnerability in the NVIDIA TLK kernel where an integer overflow in the calloc size calculation can cause the multiplication of count and size can overflow, which might lead to heap overflows.\n\n- CVE-2021-39254: A crafted NTFS image can cause an integer overflow in memmove, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow in the function ntfs_attr_record_resize, in NTFS-3G < 2021.8.22.\n\n- CVE-2021-40346: An integer overflow exists in HAProxy 2.0 through 2.5 in htx_add_header that can be exploited to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack, allowing an attacker to bypass all configured http-request HAProxy ACLs and possibly other ACLs.\n\n- CVE-2021-41864: prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds write.\n\n- CVE-2021-41991: The in-memory certificate cache in strongSwan before 5.9.4 has a remote integer overflow upon receiving many requests with different certificates to fill the cache and later trigger the replacement of cache entries. The code attempts to select a less-often-used cache entry by means of a random number generator, but this is not done correctly. Remote code execution might be a slight possibility.\n\n- CVE-2021-43784: runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. In runc, netlink is used internally as a serialization system for specifying the relevant container configuration to the `C` portion of the code (responsible for the based namespace setup of containers). In all versions of runc prior to 1.0.3, the encoder did not handle the possibility of an integer overflow in the 16-bit length field for the byte array attribute type, meaning that a large enough malicious byte array attribute could result in the length overflowing and the attribute contents being parsed as netlink messages for container configuration. This vulnerability requires the attacker to have some control over the configuration of the container and would allow the attacker to bypass the namespace restrictions of the container by simply adding their own netlink payload which disables all namespaces. The main users impacted are those who allow untrusted images with untrusted configurations to run on their machines (such as with shared cloud infrastructure). runc version 1.0.3 contains a fix for this bug. As a workaround, one may try disallowing untrusted namespace paths from your container. It should be noted that untrusted namespace paths would allow the attacker to disable namespace protections entirely even in the absence of this bug.\n\n- CVE-2021-36155: LengthPrefixedMessageReader in gRPC Swift 1.1.0 and earlier allocates buffers of arbitrary length, which allows remote attackers to cause uncontrolled resource consumption and deny service.\n\n- CVE-2020-28009: Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow because get_stdinput allows unbounded reads that are accompanied by unbounded increases in a certain size variable.

Depending on the libc used, and the underlying OS capabilities, it could be just a segfault or a heap overwrite. If the libc uses mmap for large chunks, and the OS supports mmap, then it is just a segfault (because the realloc before the integer overflow will use mremap to reduce the size of the chunk, and it will start to write to unmapped memory). However, if using a libc implementation that does not use mmap, or if the OS does not support mmap while using libc, then this could result in a heap overwrite.\n\n- CVE-2022-1923: DOS / potential heap overwrite in mkv demuxing using bzip decompression.

Users are advised to upgrade to a patched version.\n\n- CVE-2022-24310: A CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound vulnerability exists that could cause heap-based buffer overflow, leading to denial of service and potentially remote code execution when an attacker sends multiple specially crafted messages. Affected Product: Interactive Graphical SCADA System Data Server (V15.0.0.22020 and prior)\n\n- CVE-2022-24724: cmark-gfm is GitHub's extended version of the C reference implementation of CommonMark. Prior to versions 0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21, an integer overflow in cmark-gfm's table row parsing `table.c:row_from_string` may lead to heap memory corruption when parsing tables who's marker rows contain more than UINT16_MAX columns. The impact of this heap corruption ranges from Information Leak to Arbitrary Code Execution depending on how and where `cmark-gfm` is used. If `cmark-gfm` is used for rendering remote user controlled markdown, this vulnerability may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in applications employing affected versions of the `cmark-gfm` library. This vulnerability has been patched in the following cmark-gfm versions 0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21. A workaround is available. The vulnerability exists in the table markdown extensions of cmark-gfm. Disabling the table extension will prevent this vulnerability from being triggered.\n\n- CVE-2022-24795: yajl-ruby is a C binding to the YAJL JSON parsing and generation library. The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an integer overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing with large (~2GB) inputs. The reallocation logic at `yajl_buf.c#L64` may result in the `need` 32bit integer wrapping to 0 when `need` approaches a value of 0x80000000 (i.e. ~2GB of data), which results in a reallocation of buf->alloc into a small heap chunk. These integers are declared as `size_t` in the 2.x branch of `yajl`, which practically prevents the issue from triggering on 64bit platforms, however this does not preclude this issue triggering on 32bit builds on which `size_t` is a 32bit integer. Subsequent population of this under-allocated heap chunk is based on the original buffer size, leading to heap memory corruption. This vulnerability mostly impacts process availability. Maintainers believe exploitation for arbitrary code execution is unlikely. A patch is available and anticipated to be part of yajl-ruby version 1.4.2. As a workaround, avoid passing large inputs to YAJL.\n\n- CVE-2022-25291: An integer overflow in WatchGuard Firebox and XTM appliances allows an authenticated remote attacker to trigger a heap-based buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code by initiating a firmware update with a malicious upgrade image.

Versions 7.0.0 and above, prior to 7.0.5 are vulnerable to an Integer Overflow. Executing an `XAUTOCLAIM` command on a stream key in a specific state, with a specially crafted `COUNT` argument may cause an integer overflow, a subsequent heap overflow, and potentially lead to remote code execution. This has been patched in Redis version 7.0.5. No known workarounds exist.\n\n- CVE-2022-39343: Azure RTOS FileX is a FAT-compatible file system that\u2019s fully integrated with Azure RTOS ThreadX. In versions before 6.2.0, the Fault Tolerant feature of Azure RTOS FileX includes integer under and overflows which may be exploited to achieve buffer overflow and modify memory contents. When a valid log file with correct ID and checksum is detected by the `_fx_fault_tolerant_enable` function an attempt to recover the previous failed write operation is taken by call of `_fx_fault_tolerant_apply_logs`. This function iterates through the log entries and performs required recovery operations. When properly crafted a log including entries of type `FX_FAULT_TOLERANT_DIR_LOG_TYPE` may be utilized to introduce unexpected behavior. This issue has been patched in version 6.2.0. A workaround to fix line 218 in fx_fault_tolerant_apply_logs.c is documented in the GHSA.\n\n- CVE-2022-41318: A buffer over-read was discovered in libntlmauth in Squid 2.5 through 5.6.

Due to a bug in ASF code `POST /Api/ASF` ASF API endpoint responsible for updating global ASF config incorrectly removed `IPCPassword` from the resulting config when the caller did not specify it explicitly. Due to the above, it was possible for the user to accidentally remove `IPCPassword` security measure from his IPC interface when updating global ASF config, which exists as part of global config update functionality in ASF-ui. Removal of `IPCPassword` possesses a security risk, as unauthorized users may in result access the IPC interface after such modification. The issue is patched in ASF V5.1.2.4 and future versions. We recommend to manually verify that `IPCPassword` is specified after update, and if not, set it accordingly. In default settings, ASF is configured to allow IPC access from `localhost` only and should not affect majority of users.\n\n- CVE-2021-3282: HashiCorp Vault Enterprise 1.6.0 & 1.6.1 allowed the `remove-peer` raft operator command to be executed against DR secondaries without authentication.

Prior to version 1.10.7, FreeSWITCH does not authenticate SIP MESSAGE requests, leading to spam and message spoofing. By default, SIP requests of the type MESSAGE (RFC 3428) are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. MESSAGE requests are relayed to SIP user agents registered with the FreeSWITCH server without requiring any authentication. Although this behaviour can be changed by setting the `auth-messages` parameter to `true`, it is not the default setting. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to send SIP MESSAGE messages to any SIP user agent that is registered with the server without requiring authentication. Additionally, since no authentication is required, chat messages can be spoofed to appear to come from trusted entities. Therefore, abuse can lead to spam and enable social engineering, phishing and similar attacks. This issue is patched in version 1.10.7. Maintainers recommend that this SIP message type is authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to be explicitly set the `auth-messages` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-38412: Properly formatted POST requests to multiple resources on the HTTP and HTTPS web servers of the Digi PortServer TS 16 Rack device do not require authentication or authentication tokens. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to enable the SNMP service and manipulate the community strings to achieve further control in.\n\n- CVE-2021-41157: FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. By default, SIP requests of the type SUBSCRIBE are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to subscribe to user agent event notifications without the need to authenticate. This abuse poses privacy concerns and might lead to social engineering or similar attacks. For example, attackers may be able to monitor the status of target SIP extensions. Although this issue was fixed in version v1.10.6, installations upgraded to the fixed version of FreeSWITCH from an older version, may still be vulnerable if the configuration is not updated accordingly. Software upgrades do not update the configuration by default. SIP SUBSCRIBE messages should be authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to explicitly set the `auth-subscriptions` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2020-25566: In SapphireIMS 5.0, it is possible to take over an account by sending a request to the Save_Password form as shown in POC.

The current security vulnerability allows access to keys and buckets through a curl command or an unauthenticated HTTP request. This enables unauthorized access to buckets and keys thereby exposing data to anonymous clients or users. This affected Apache Ozone prior to the 1.1.0 release.\n\n- CVE-2020-4669: IBM Planning Analytics Local 2.0 connects to a MongoDB server. MongoDB, a document-oriented database system, is listening on the remote port, and it is configured to allow connections without password authentication. A remote attacker can gain unauthorized access to the database. IBM X-Force ID: 184600.\n\n- CVE-2021-33924: Confluent Ansible (cp-ansible) version 5.5.0, 5.5.1, 5.5.2 and 6.0.0 is vulnerable to Incorrect Access Control via its auxiliary component that allows remote attackers to access sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2021-35936: If remote logging is not used, the worker (in the case of CeleryExecutor) or the scheduler (in the case of LocalExecutor) runs a Flask logging server and is listening on a specific port and also binds on 0.0.0.0 by default.

This often exists in Linux-based code assuming the controlled nature of the root directory (/) or its subdirectories (/etc, etc), or a code that recursively accesses the parent directory. In Windows, the drive root and some of its subdirectories have weak permissions by default, which makes them uncontrolled.\n\n\nIn some Unix-based systems, a PATH might be created that contains an empty element, e.g. by splicing an empty variable into the PATH. This empty element can be interpreted as equivalent to the current working directory, which might be an untrusted search element.\n\n\nIn software package management frameworks (e.g., npm, RubyGems, or PyPi), the framework may identify dependencies on third-party libraries or other packages, then consult a repository that contains the desired package. The framework may search a public repository before a private repository. This could be exploited by attackers by placing a malicious package in the public repository that has the same name as a package from the private repository. The search path might not be directly under control of the developer relying on the framework, but this search order effectively contains an untrusted element.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2023-25815: chain: a change in an underlying package causes the gettext function to use implicit initialization with a hard-coded path (CWE-1419) under the user-writable C:\\ drive, introducing an untrusted search path element (CWE-427) that enables spoofing of messages.\n\n- CVE-2022-4826: Go-based git extension on Windows can search for and execute a malicious \"..exe\" in a repository because Go searches the current working directory if git.exe is not found in the PATH\n\n- CVE-2020-26284: A Static Site Generator built in Go, when running on Windows, searches the current working directory for a command, possibly allowing code execution using a malicious .exe or .bat file with the name being searched\n\n- CVE-2022-24765: Windows-based fork of git creates a \".git\" folder in the C: drive, allowing local attackers to create a .git folder with a malicious config file\n\n- CVE-2019-1552: SSL package searches under \"C:/usr/local\" for configuration files and other critical data, but C:/usr/local might be world-writable.\n\n- CVE-2010-3402: \"DLL hijacking\" issue in document editor.\n\n- CVE-2010-3397: \"DLL hijacking\" issue in encryption software.\n\n- CVE-2010-3138: \"DLL hijacking\" issue in library used by multiple media players.\n\n- CVE-2010-3152: \"DLL hijacking\" issue in illustration program.\n\n- CVE-2010-3147: \"DLL hijacking\" issue in address book.\n\n- CVE-2010-3135: \"DLL hijacking\" issue in network monitoring software.\n\n- CVE-2010-3131: \"DLL hijacking\" issue in web browser.\n\n- CVE-2010-1795: \"DLL hijacking\" issue in music player/organizer.\n\n- CVE-2002-1576: Product uses the current working directory to find and execute a program, which allows local users to gain privileges by creating a symlink that points to a malicious version of the program.\n\n- CVE-1999-1461: Product trusts the PATH environmental variable to find and execute a program, which allows local users to obtain root access by modifying the PATH to point to a malicous version of that program.\n\n- CVE-1999-1318: Software uses a search path that includes the current working directory (.), which allows local users to gain privileges via malicious programs.\n\n- CVE-2003-0579: Admin software trusts the user-supplied -uv.install command line option to find and execute the uv.install program, which allows local users to gain privileges by providing a pathname that is under control of the user.\n\n- CVE-2000-0854: When a document is opened, the directory of that document is first used to locate DLLs , which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands by inserting malicious DLLs into the same directory as the document.\n\n- CVE-2001-0943: Database trusts the PATH environment variable to find and execute programs, which allows local users to modify the PATH to point to malicious programs.\n\n- CVE-2001-0942: Database uses an environment variable to find and execute a program, which allows local users to execute arbitrary programs by changing the environment variable.\n\n- CVE-2001-0507: Server uses relative paths to find system files that will run in-process, which allows local users to gain privileges via a malicious file.\n\n- CVE-2002-2017: Product allows local users to execute arbitrary code by setting an environment variable to reference a malicious program.\n\n- CVE-1999-0690: Product includes the current directory in root's PATH variable.\n\n- CVE-2001-0912: Error during packaging causes product to include a hard-coded, non-standard directory in search path.\n\n- CVE-2001-0289: Product searches current working directory for configuration file.\n\n- CVE-2005-1705: Product searches current working directory for configuration file.\n\n- CVE-2005-1307: Product executable other program from current working directory.\n\n- CVE-2002-2040: Untrusted path.\n\n- CVE-2005-2072: Modification of trusted environment variable leads to untrusted path vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2005-1632: Product searches /tmp for modules before other paths.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-3115: Go before 1.14.14 and 1.15.x before 1.15.7 on Windows is vulnerable to Command Injection and remote code execution when using the \"go get\" command to fetch modules that make use of cgo (for example, cgo can execute a gcc program from an untrusted download).\n\n- CVE-2021-37617: The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud Server with a computer.

There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-20001: fish is a command line shell. fish version 3.1.0 through version 3.3.1 is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution. git repositories can contain per-repository configuration that change the behavior of git, including running arbitrary commands. When using the default configuration of fish, changing to a directory automatically runs `git` commands in order to display information about the current repository in the prompt. If an attacker can convince a user to change their current directory into one controlled by the attacker, such as on a shared file system or extracted archive, fish will run arbitrary commands under the attacker's control. This problem has been fixed in fish 3.4.0. Note that running git in these directories, including using the git tab completion, remains a potential trigger for this issue. As a workaround, remove the `fish_git_prompt` function from the prompt.\n\n- CVE-2021-28953: The unofficial C/C++ Advanced Lint extension before 1.9.0 for Visual Studio Code allows attackers to execute arbitrary binaries if the user opens a crafted repository.\n\n- CVE-2022-23853: The LSP (Language Server Protocol) plugin in KDE Kate before 21.12.2 and KTextEditor before 5.91.0 tries to execute the associated LSP server binary when opening a file of a given type. If this binary is absent from the PATH, it will try running the LSP server binary in the directory of the file that was just opened (due to a misunderstanding of the QProcess API, that was never intended). This can be an untrusted directory.\n\n- CVE-2022-22528: SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) - version 16.0, installation makes an entry in the system PATH environment variable in Windows platform which, under certain conditions, allows a Standard User to execute malicious Windows binaries which may lead to privilege escalation on the local system. The issue is with the ASE installer and does not impact other ASE binaries. \n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-668 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-668 (ChildOf)",

    "enhanced_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nIn snapd versions prior to 2.62, snapd failed to properly check the file type when extracting a snap. The snap format is a squashfs file-system image and so can contain files that are non-regular files (such as pipes or sockets etc). Various file entries within the snap squashfs image (such as icons etc) are directly read by snapd when it is extracted. An attacker who could convince a user to install a malicious snap which contained non-regular files at these paths could then cause snapd to block indefinitely trying to read from such files and cause a denial of service.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **rootcause:** **improper file type check**\n- **impact:** denial of service\n- **product:** snapd\n- **version:** prior to 2.62\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of symbolic links (symlinks) within snap packages. Specifically, the code did not properly prevent symlinks from pointing outside the container, or to potentially problematic locations like the root directory (`.`) or the `meta` directory.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **External Symlink Vulnerability:** The code did not adequately check if a symlink target was external to the snap container. An attacker could potentially create a symlink that points to a location outside the snap's intended scope.\n*   **Bad Symlink Targets:** The code did not prevent symlinks pointing to `.` or `meta` directory.\n*   **Inadequate Symlink Evaluation:** The initial implementation had a potential for infinite loops due to insufficient limits when evaluating nested symlinks, which was mitigated by introducing `maxDepth`.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary File Access (Potentially):** By creating malicious symlinks that point to sensitive locations outside the snap container, an attacker could potentially gain read or write access to arbitrary files on the system.\n*   **Denial of Service (Potentially):**  If symlink loops were not handled correctly, they could have led to a denial of service. The introduction of `maxDepth` prevents infinite loop.\n*   **Circumvention of Security Measures:**  Exploitation could bypass intended security restrictions by manipulating the file system access within the snap's environment.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Malicious Snap Package Creation:** An attacker could create a specially crafted snap package that includes malicious symlinks.\n*   **Compromised Snap Store (Potentially):** If the attacker were able to compromise a snap store, they could distribute malicious snap packages.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **Ability to Create and Distribute Snap Packages:**  The attacker would need the ability to create their own snap packages and potentially distribute them through a channel where they will be installed.\n*   **Understanding of Snap Package Structure:** The attacker would need knowledge about how snap packages are structured and how symlinks are handled.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n* The provided content shows a fix for this issue. The fix includes a new function `evalAndValidateSymlink` which evaluates symlinks and ensures that the target of a symlink is not external to the container. It also checks for symlinks that target \".\" or \"meta\" directories.\n* The commit message \"many: container validation improvements\" indicates this is a broader change to improve validation and not just addressing one specific issue.\n* Code review comments show concerns about the efficiency of string manipulation, which was addressed by using `strings.HasPrefix` instead of splitting and indexing the string.\n\nIn summary, the vulnerability allowed for malicious symlinks within snap packages to potentially escape the container, leading to arbitrary file access, denial of service, and circumvention of security measures. The provided code changes contain a fix which introduces proper symlink validation and prevents external symlinks, as well as symlinks pointing to '.' and 'meta' directories.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 59 | Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.545 |\n| 2 | 23 | Relative Path Traversal | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.517 |\n| 3 | 22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.512 |\n| 4 | 61 | UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following | Compound | Allowed | sparse | 0.506 |\n| 5 | 923 | Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.494 |\n| 6 | 646 | Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File | Variant | Allowed | dense | 0.403 |\n| 7 | 363 | Race Condition Enabling Link Following | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.490 |\n| 9 | 1333 | Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.490 |\n| 10 | 863 | Incorrect Authorization | Class | Allowed-with-Review | sparse | 0.489 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\ninsecure temporary file: Some people use the phrase \"insecure temporary file\" when referring to a link following weakness, but other weaknesses can produce insecure temporary files without any symlink involvement at all.\nZip Slip: \"Zip slip\" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282]. It is most commonly used for relative path traversal (CWE-23) and link following (CWE-59).\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-706\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Theoretical]** \n\nLink following vulnerabilities are Multi-factor Vulnerabilities (MFV). They are the combination of multiple elements: file or directory permissions, filename predictability, race conditions, and in some cases, a design limitation in which there is no mechanism for performing atomic file creation operations.\n\n\nSome potential factors are race conditions, permissions, and predictability.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1386:** Some versions of Perl follow symbolic links when running with the -e option, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.\n- **CVE-2000-1178:** Text editor follows symbolic links when creating a rescue copy during an abnormal exit, which allows local users to overwrite the files of other users.\n- **CVE-2004-0217:** Antivirus update allows local users to create or append to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a logfile.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nZip Slip: \"Zip slip\" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282].

Probllama\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2019-20916:** Python package manager does not correctly restrict the filename specified in a Content-Disposition header, allowing arbitrary file read using path traversal sequences such as \"../\"\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nMany file operations are intended to take place within a restricted directory. By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDirectory traversal\nPath traversal: \"Path traversal\" is preferred over \"directory traversal,\" but both terms are attack-focused.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add \".txt\" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.\n\n**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.\n\n**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing \"/\" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nLike other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use \"directory traversal\" only to refer to the injection of \"..\" and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.\n\n\nOther variants like \"absolute pathname\" and \"drive letter\" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve \"..\" or equivalent.\n\n\n**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.\n\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nIncomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that \"..\\\" is vulnerable, but not test \"../\" which may also be vulnerable.\n\n\nAny combination of directory separators (\"/\", \"\\\", etc.) and numbers of \".\" (e.g. \"....\") can produce unique variants; for example, the \"//../\" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a. Probllama\n- **CVE-2024-4315:** Chain: API for text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) does not include the \"\\\" Windows folder separator in its denylist (CWE-184) when attempting to prevent Local File Inclusion via path traversal (CWE-22), allowing deletion of arbitrary files on Windows systems.\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-61: UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following\n**Abstraction:** Compound\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the file is a symbolic link that resolves to a target outside of the intended control sphere. This could allow an attacker to cause the product to operate on unauthorized files.\n\n### Extended Description\nA product that allows UNIX symbolic links (symlink) as part of paths whether in internal code or through user input can allow an attacker to spoof the symbolic link and traverse the file system to unintended locations or access arbitrary files. The symbolic link can permit an attacker to read/write/corrupt a file that they originally did not have permissions to access.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nSymlink following\nsymlink vulnerability\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-59\nRequires -> CWE-362\nRequires -> CWE-340\nRequires -> CWE-386\nRequires -> CWE-732\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n**Comments:** While attack-oriented composites are supported in CWE, they have not been a focus of research. There is a chance that future research or CWE scope clarifications will change or deprecate them. Perform root-cause analysis to determine which weaknesses allow symlink following to occur, and map to those weaknesses. For example, predictable file names might be intended functionality, but creation in a directory with insecure permissions might not.\n**Reasons:**\n- Other\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nSymlink vulnerabilities are regularly found in C and shell programs, but all programming languages can have this problem. Even shell programs are probably under-reported.\n\n\n\"Second-order symlink vulnerabilities\" may exist in programs that invoke other programs that follow symlinks. They are rarely reported but are likely to be fairly common when process invocation is used [REF-493].\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1386:** Some versions of Perl follow symbolic links when running with the -e option, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.\n- **CVE-2000-1178:** Text editor follows symbolic links when creating a rescue copy during an abnormal exit, which allows local users to overwrite the files of other users.\n- **CVE-2004-0217:** Antivirus update allows local users to create or append to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a logfile.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nAttackers might be able to spoof the intended endpoint from a different system or process, thus gaining the same level of access as the intended endpoint.\n\n\nWhile this issue frequently involves authentication between network-based clients and servers, other types of communication channels and endpoints can have this weakness.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-30319:** S-bus functionality in a home automation product performs access control using an IP allowlist, which can be bypassed by a forged IP address.\n- **CVE-2022-22547:** A troubleshooting tool exposes a web server on a random port between 9000-65535 that could be used for information gathering\n- **CVE-2022-4390:** A WAN interface on a router has firewall restrictions enabled for IPv4, but it does not for IPv6, which is enabled by default\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-646: Reliance on File Name or Extension of Externally-Supplied File\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product allows a file to be uploaded, but it relies on the file name or extension of the file to determine the appropriate behaviors. This could be used by attackers to cause the file to be misclassified and processed in a dangerous fashion.\n\n### Extended Description\nAn application might use the file name or extension of a user-supplied file to determine the proper course of action, such as selecting the correct process to which control should be passed, deciding what data should be made available, or what resources should be allocated. If the attacker can cause the code to misclassify the supplied file, then the wrong action could occur. For example, an attacker could supply a file that ends in a \".php.gif\" extension that appears to be a GIF image, but would be processed as PHP code. In extreme cases, code execution is possible, but the attacker could also cause exhaustion of resources, denial of service, exposure of debug or system data (including application source code), or being bound to a particular server side process. This weakness may be due to a vulnerability in any of the technologies used by the web and application servers, due to misconfiguration, or resultant from another flaw in the application itself.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-345\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-363: Race Condition Enabling Link Following\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product checks the status of a file or directory before accessing it, which produces a race condition in which the file can be replaced with a link before the access is performed, causing the product to access the wrong file.\n\n### Extended Description\nWhile developers might expect that there is a very narrow time window between the time of check and time of use, there is still a race condition. An attacker could cause the product to slow down (e.g. with memory consumption), causing the time window to become larger. Alternately, in some situations, the attacker could win the race by performing a large number of attacks.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-367\nCanPrecede -> CWE-59\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is already covered by the \"Link Following\" weakness (CWE-59). It is included here because so many people associate race conditions with link problems; however, not all link following issues involve race conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nSpecified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-789\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop\n- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles.\n\n### Extended Description\nSome regular expression engines have a feature called \"backtracking\". If the token cannot match, the engine \"backtracks\" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.\n Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:\n\n\n  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.\n\n  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.\n\n  - The input can be long enough.\n\n Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. \n\n### Alternative Terms\nReDoS: ReDoS is an abbreviation of \"Regular expression Denial of Service\".\nRegular Expression Denial of Service: While this term is attack-focused, this is commonly used to describe the weakness.\nCatastrophic backtracking: This term is used to describe the behavior of the regular expression as a negative technical impact.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-407\nChildOf -> CWE-407\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-5243:** server allows ReDOS with crafted User-Agent strings, due to overlapping capture groups that cause excessive backtracking.\n- **CVE-2021-21317:** npm package for user-agent parser prone to ReDoS due to overlapping capture groups\n- **CVE-2019-16215:** Markdown parser uses inefficient regex when processing a message, allowing users to cause CPU consumption and delay preventing processing of other messages.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nAuthZ: \"AuthZ\" is typically used as an abbreviation of \"authorization\" within the web application security community. It is distinct from \"AuthN\" (or, sometimes, \"AuthC\") which is an abbreviation of \"authentication.\" The use of \"Auth\" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-285\nChildOf -> CWE-284\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** \n\nAssuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-39155:** Chain: A microservice integration and management platform compares the hostname in the HTTP Host header in a case-sensitive way (CWE-178, CWE-1289), allowing bypass of the authorization policy (CWE-863) using a hostname with mixed case or other variations.\n- **CVE-2019-15900:** Chain: sscanf() call is used to check if a username and group exists, but the return value of sscanf() call is not checked (CWE-252), causing an uninitialized variable to be checked (CWE-457), returning success to allow authorization bypass for executing a privileged (CWE-863).\n- **CVE-2009-2213:** Gateway uses default \"Allow\" configuration for its authorization settings.\n\n",

NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-11736.\n\n- CVE-2021-21272: ORAS is open source software which enables a way to push OCI Artifacts to OCI Conformant registries. ORAS is both a CLI for initial testing and a Go Module. In ORAS from version 0.4.0 and before version 0.9.0, there is a \"zip-slip\" vulnerability. The directory support feature allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links and hard links. A well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who runs `oras pull`. Users of the affected versions are impacted if they are `oras` CLI users who runs `oras pull`, or if they are Go programs, which invoke `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`. The problem has been fixed in version 0.9.0. For `oras` CLI users, there is no workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider. For `oras` package users, the workaround is to not use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`, and use other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider.\n\n- CVE-2021-28650: autoar-extractor.c in GNOME gnome-autoar before 0.3.1, as used by GNOME Shell, Nautilus, and other software, allows Directory Traversal during extraction because it lacks a check of whether a file's parent is a symlink in certain complex situations. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-36241.\n\n- CVE-2021-32518: A vulnerability in share_link in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote attackers to create a symbolic link then access arbitrary files. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32803: The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.4.15, and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via insufficient symlink protection. `node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-32825: bblfshd is an open source self-hosted server for source code parsing. In bblfshd before commit 4265465b9b6fb5663c30ee43806126012066aad4 there is a \"zipslip\" vulnerability. The unsafe handling of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may enable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations outside the designated target folder. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive file. Additionally, if the attacker has read access to the unpacked files, he may be able to read arbitrary system files the parent process has permissions to read. For more details including a PoC see the referenced GHSL-2020-258.\n\n- CVE-2021-36286: Dell SupportAssist Client Consumer versions 3.9.13.0 and any versions prior to 3.9.13.0 contain an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability that can be exploited by using the Windows feature of NTFS called Symbolic links. Symbolic links can be created by any(non-privileged) user under some object directories, but by themselves are not sufficient to successfully escalate privileges. However, combining them with a different object, such as the NTFS junction point allows for the exploitation. Support assist clean files functionality do not distinguish junction points from the physical folder and proceeds to clean the target of the junction that allows nonprivileged users to create junction points and delete arbitrary files on the system which can be accessed only by the admin.\n\n- CVE-2021-38511: An issue was discovered in the tar crate before 0.4.36 for Rust. When symlinks are present in a TAR archive, extraction can create arbitrary directories via .. traversal.\n\n- CVE-2021-29136: Open Container Initiative umoci before 0.4.7 allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary host paths via a crafted image that causes symlink traversal when \"umoci unpack\" or \"umoci raw unpack\" is used.\n\n- CVE-2020-27833: A Zip Slip vulnerability was found in the oc binary in openshift-clients where an arbitrary file write is achieved by using a specially crafted raw container image (.tar file) which contains symbolic links. The vulnerability is limited to the command `oc image extract`. If a symbolic link is first created pointing within the tarball, this allows further symbolic links to bypass the existing path check. This flaw allows the tarball to create links outside the tarball's parent directory, allowing for executables or configuration files to be overwritten, resulting in arbitrary code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. Versions up to and including openshift-clients-4.7.0-202104250659.p0.git.95881af are affected.\n\n- CVE-2020-27697: Trend Micro Security 2020 (Consumer) contains a vulnerability in the installer package that could be exploited by placing a malicious DLL in a non-protected location with high privileges (symlink attack) which can lead to obtaining administrative privileges during the installation of the product.\n\n- CVE-2020-4717: A vulnerability exists in IBM SPSS Modeler Subscription Installer that allows a user with create symbolic link permission to write arbitrary file in another protected path during product installation. IBM X-Force ID: 187727.\n\n- CVE-2021-23239: The sudoedit personality of Sudo before 1.9.5 may allow a local unprivileged user to perform arbitrary directory-existence tests by winning a sudo_edit.c race condition in replacing a user-controlled directory by a symlink to an arbitrary path.\n\n- CVE-2021-32508: Absolute Path Traversal vulnerability in FileStreaming in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote authenticated attackers access arbitrary files by injecting the Symbolic Link following the Url path parameter. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32509: Absolute Path Traversal vulnerability in FileviewDoc in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote authenticated attackers access arbitrary files by injecting the Symbolic Link following the Url path parameter. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-24084: Windows Mobile Device Management Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-1642: Windows AppX Deployment Extensions Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-1685: Windows AppX Deployment Extensions Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-1695: Windows Print Spooler Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-1697: Windows InstallService Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-1729: Windows Update Stack Setup Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26425: Windows Event Tracing Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26426: Windows User Account Profile Picture Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26862: Windows Installer Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26866: Windows Update Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26873: Windows User Profile Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-26887: <p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows when Folder redirection has been enabled via Group Policy. When folder redirection file server is co-located with Terminal server, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability would be able to begin redirecting another user's personal data to a created folder.</p> <p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker can create a new folder under the Folder Redirection root path and create a junction on a newly created User folder. When the new user logs in, Folder Redirection would start redirecting to the folder and copying personal data.</p> <p>This elevation of privilege vulnerability can only be addressed by reconfiguring Folder Redirection with Offline files and restricting permissions, and NOT via a security update for affected Windows Servers.

It affects multi-user setups in which \u2019guix-daemon\u2019 runs locally. The attack consists in having an unprivileged user spawn a build process, for instance with `guix build`, that makes its build directory world-writable. The user then creates a hardlink to a root-owned file such as /etc/shadow in that build directory. If the user passed the --keep-failed option and the build eventually fails, the daemon changes ownership of the whole build tree, including the hardlink, to the user. At that point, the user has write access to the target file. Versions after and including v0.11.0-3298-g2608e40988, and versions prior to v1.2.0-75109-g94f0312546 are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2020-28007: Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Execution with Unnecessary Privileges. Because Exim operates as root in the log directory (owned by a non-root user), a symlink or hard link attack allows overwriting critical root-owned files anywhere on the filesystem.\n\n- CVE-2021-22488: There is an Unauthorized file access vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability by modifying soft links may tamper with the files restored from backups.\n\n- CVE-2021-23872: Privilege Escalation vulnerability in the File Lock component of McAfee Total Protection (MTP) prior to 16.0.32 allows a local user to gain elevated privileges by manipulating a symbolic link in the IOCTL interface.\n\n- CVE-2021-23873: Privilege Escalation vulnerability in McAfee Total Protection (MTP) prior to 16.0.30 allows a local user to gain elevated privileges and perform arbitrary file deletion as the SYSTEM user potentially causing Denial of Service via manipulating Junction link, after enumerating certain files, at a specific time.\n\n- CVE-2021-34408: The Zoom Client for Meetings for Windows in all versions before version 5.3.2 writes log files to a user writable directory as a privileged user during the installation or update of the client. This could allow for potential privilege escalation if a link was created between the user writable directory used and a non-user writable directory.\n\n- CVE-2021-36744: Trend Micro Security (Consumer) 2021 and 2020 are vulnerable to a directory junction vulnerability which could allow an attacker to exploit the system to escalate privileges and create a denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2021-37969: Inappropriate implementation in Google Updater in Google Chrome on Windows prior to 94.0.4606.54 allowed a remote attacker to perform local privilege escalation via a crafted file.\n\n- CVE-2021-44038: An issue was discovered in Quagga through 1.2.4. Unsafe chown/chmod operations in the suggested spec file allow users (with control of the non-root-owned directory /etc/quagga) to escalate their privileges to root upon package installation or update.\n\n- CVE-2021-31843: Improper privileges management vulnerability in McAfee Endpoint Security (ENS) Windows prior to 10.7.0 September 2021 Update allows local users to access files which they would otherwise not have access to via manipulating junction links to redirect McAfee folder operations to an unintended location. \n\n- CVE-2020-7346: Privilege Escalation vulnerability in McAfee Data Loss Prevention (DLP) for Windows prior to 11.6.100 allows a local, low privileged, attacker through the use of junctions to cause the product to load DLLs of the attacker's choosing. This requires the creation and removal of junctions by the attacker along with sending a specific IOTL command at the correct time. \n\n- CVE-2021-45231: A link following privilege escalation vulnerability in Trend Micro Apex One (on-prem and SaaS) and Trend Micro Worry-Free Business Security (10.0 SP1 and Services) could allow a local attacker to create a specially crafted file with arbitrary content which could grant local privilege escalation on the affected system. Please note: an attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-43237: Windows Setup Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-43238: Windows Remote Access Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-41551: Leostream Connection Broker 9.0.40.17 allows administrators to conduct directory traversal attacks by uploading z ZIP file that contains a symbolic link.\n\n- CVE-2020-0787: An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) improperly handles symbolic links, aka 'Windows Background Intelligent Transfer Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability'.\n\n- CVE-2021-4287: A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in ReFirm Labs binwalk up to 2.3.2.

By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-37032: Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a.

A path traversal vulnerability exists in versions prior to 15.3.18, 15.5.3, and 16.0.0. Using a specially prepared ZIP file, it is possible to overwrite any file that is writable by the application server user (e.g. the tomcat user). Depending on the configuration this can be limited to files of the OpenOlat user data directory, however, if not properly set up, the attack could also be used to overwrite application server config files, java code or even operating system files. The attack could be used to corrupt or modify any OpenOlat file such as course structures, config files or temporary test data. Those attack would require in-depth knowledge of the installation and thus more theoretical. If the app server configuration allows the execution of jsp files and the path to the context is known, it is also possible to execute java code. If the app server runs with the same user that is used to deploy the OpenOlat code or has write permissions on the OpenOlat code files and the path to the context is know, code injection is possible. The attack requires an OpenOlat user account to upload a ZIP file and trigger the unzip method. It can not be exploited by unregistered users. The problem is fixed in versions 15.3.18, 15.5.3 and 16.0.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.\n\n- CVE-2020-19146: Improper Access Control in Jfinal CMS v4.7.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via the 'TemplatePath' parameter in the component 'jfinal_cms/admin/folder/list'.\n\n- CVE-2020-19147: Improper Access Control in Jfinal CMS v4.7.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive infromation via the 'getFolder()' function in the component '/modules/filemanager/FileManager.java'.\n\n- CVE-2020-26806: admin/file.do in ObjectPlanet Opinio before 7.15 allows Unrestricted File Upload of executable JSP files, resulting in remote code execution, because filePath can have directory traversal and fileContent can be valid JSP code.\n\n- CVE-2021-20034: An improper access control vulnerability in SMA100 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to bypass the path traversal checks and delete an arbitrary file potentially resulting in a reboot to factory default settings.\n\n- CVE-2021-23428: This affects all versions of package elFinder.NetCore.

The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation of URLs in HTTP requests processed by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request containing directory traversal character sequences to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view arbitrary files within the web services file system on the targeted device. The web services file system is enabled when the affected device is configured with either WebVPN or AnyConnect features. This vulnerability cannot be used to obtain access to ASA or FTD system files or underlying operating system (OS) files.\n\n- CVE-2020-11652: An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt before 2019.2.4 and 3000 before 3000.2. The salt-master process ClearFuncs class allows access to some methods that improperly sanitize paths. These methods allow arbitrary directory access to authenticated users.\n\n- CVE-2020-1631: A vulnerability in the HTTP/HTTPS service used by J-Web, Web Authentication, Dynamic-VPN (DVPN), Firewall Authentication Pass-Through with Web-Redirect, and Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) allows an unauthenticated attacker to perform local file inclusion (LFI) or path traversal. Using this vulnerability, an attacker may be able to inject commands into the httpd.log, read files with 'world' readable permission file or obtain J-Web session tokens. In the case of command injection, as the HTTP service runs as user 'nobody', the impact of this command injection is limited. (CVSS score 5.3, vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) In the case of reading files with 'world' readable permission, in Junos OS 19.3R1 and above, the unauthenticated attacker would be able to read the configuration file. (CVSS score 5.9, vector CVSS:3.1/ AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) If J-Web is enabled, the attacker could gain the same level of access of anyone actively logged into J-Web. If an administrator is logged in, the attacker could gain administrator access to J-Web. (CVSS score 8.8, vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) This issue only affects Juniper Networks Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services enabled. Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services disabled are not affected. If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled, the following command will show the httpd processes: user@device> show system processes | match http 5260 - S 0:00.13 /usr/sbin/httpd-gk -N 5797 - I 0:00.10 /usr/sbin/httpd --config /jail/var/etc/httpd.conf To summarize: If HTTP/HTTPS services are disabled, there is no impact from this vulnerability. If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled and J-Web is not in use, this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.9 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N). If J-Web is enabled, this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Juniper SIRT has received a single report of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild. Out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying customers so they can take appropriate actions. Indicators of Compromise: The /var/log/httpd.log may have indicators that commands have injected or files being accessed. The device administrator can look for these indicators by searching for the string patterns \"=*;*&\" or \"*%3b*&\" in /var/log/httpd.log, using the following command: user@device> show log httpd.log | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" If this command returns any output, it might be an indication of malicious attempts or simply scanning activities. Rotated logs should also be reviewed, using the following command: user@device> show log httpd.log.0.gz | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" user@device> show log httpd.log.1.gz | match \"=*;*&|=*%3b*&\" Note that a skilled attacker would likely remove these entries from the local log file, thus effectively eliminating any reliable signature that the device had been attacked.

Argo CD starting with version 1.3.0 but before versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0 is vulnerable to a path traversal bug, compounded by an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious user with read-only repository access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user who has been granted `get` access for a repository containing a Helm chart can craft an API request to the `/api/v1/repositories/{repo_url}/appdetails` endpoint to leak the contents of out-of-bounds files from the repo-server. The malicious payload would reference an out-of-bounds file, and the contents of that file would be returned as part of the response. Contents from a non-YAML file may be returned as part of an error message. The attacker would have to know or guess the location of the target file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include files from other Applications' source repositories or any secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. This vulnerability is patched in Argo CD versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0. The patches prevent path traversal and limit access to users who either A) have been granted Application `create` privileges or B) have been granted Application `get` privileges and are requesting details for a `repo_url` that has already been used for the given Application. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-27925: Zimbra Collaboration (aka ZCS) 8.8.15 and 9.0 has mboximport functionality that receives a ZIP archive and extracts files from it.

The pesign package provides a systemd service used to start the pesign daemon. This service unit runs a script to set ACLs for /etc/pki/pesign and /run/pesign directories to grant access privileges to users in the 'pesign' group. However, the script doesn't check for symbolic links. This could allow an attacker to gain access to privileged files and directories via a path traversal attack.\n\n- CVE-2022-42280: NVIDIA BMC contains a vulnerability in SPX REST auth handler, where an un-authorized attacker can exploit a path traversal, which may lead to authentication bypass.\n\n- CVE-2021-1256: A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite files on the file system of an affected device by using directory traversal techniques. A successful exploit could cause system instability if important system files are overwritten. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user input for the file path in a specific CLI command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to a targeted device and issuing a specific CLI command with crafted user input. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the file system of the affected device. The attacker would need valid user credentials on the device.\n\n- CVE-2022-29580: There exists a path traversal vulnerability in the Android Google Search app. This is caused by the incorrect usage of uri.getLastPathSegment.

An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration \"require all denied\", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.\n\n- CVE-2022-41352: An issue was discovered in Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) 8.8.15 and 9.0. An attacker can upload arbitrary files through amavis via a cpio loophole (extraction to /opt/zimbra/jetty/webapps/zimbra/public) that can lead to incorrect access to any other user accounts. Zimbra recommends pax over cpio. Also, pax is in the prerequisites of Zimbra on Ubuntu; however, pax is no longer part of a default Red Hat installation after RHEL 6 (or CentOS 6). Once pax is installed, amavis automatically prefers it over cpio.\n\n- CVE-2022-3966: A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in Ultimate Member Plugin up to 2.5.0. This issue affects the function load_template of the file includes/core/class-shortcodes.php of the component Template Handler. The manipulation of the argument tpl leads to pathname traversal.

This is accomplished by extracting package contents into a project's `node_modules` folder. If the `node_modules` folder of the root project or any of its dependencies is somehow replaced with a symbolic link, it could allow Arborist to write package dependencies to any arbitrary location on the file system. Note that symbolic links contained within package artifact contents are filtered out, so another means of creating a `node_modules` symbolic link would have to be employed. 1. A `preinstall` script could replace `node_modules` with a symlink. (This is prevented by using `--ignore-scripts`.) 2. An attacker could supply the target with a git repository, instructing them to run `npm install --ignore-scripts` in the root. This may be successful, because `npm install --ignore-scripts` is typically not capable of making changes outside of the project directory, so it may be deemed safe. This is patched in @npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above. For more information including workarounds please see the referenced GHSA-gmw6-94gg-2rc2.\n\n- CVE-2021-1612: A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software CLI could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the local system. This vulnerability is due to improper access controls on files within the local file system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a symbolic link in a specific location on the local file system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on an affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-26089: An improper symlink following in FortiClient for Mac 6.4.3 and below may allow an non-privileged user to execute arbitrary privileged shell commands during installation phase.\n\n- CVE-2022-20720: Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOx application hosting environment on multiple Cisco platforms could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying host operating system, execute arbitrary code on the underlying host operating system, install applications without being authenticated, or conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the affected software. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2022-26612: In Apache Hadoop, The unTar function uses unTarUsingJava function on Windows and the built-in tar utility on Unix and other OSes. As a result, a TAR entry may create a symlink under the expected extraction directory which points to an external directory. A subsequent TAR entry may extract an arbitrary file into the external directory using the symlink name. This however would be caught by the same targetDirPath check on Unix because of the getCanonicalPath call. However on Windows, getCanonicalPath doesn't resolve symbolic links, which bypasses the check. unpackEntries during TAR extraction follows symbolic links which allows writing outside expected base directory on Windows. This was addressed in Apache Hadoop 3.2.3\n\n- CVE-2022-3592: A symlink following vulnerability was found in Samba, where a user can create a symbolic link that will make 'smbd' escape the configured share path. This flaw allows a remote user with access to the exported part of the file system under a share via SMB1 unix extensions or NFS to create symlinks to files outside the 'smbd' configured share path and gain access to another restricted server's filesystem.\n\n- CVE-2022-36113: Cargo is a package manager for the rust programming language. After a package is downloaded, Cargo extracts its source code in the ~/.cargo folder on disk, making it available to the Rust projects it builds. To record when an extraction is successful, Cargo writes \"ok\" to the .cargo-ok file at the root of the extracted source code once it extracted all the files. It was discovered that Cargo allowed packages to contain a .cargo-ok symbolic link, which Cargo would extract. Then, when Cargo attempted to write \"ok\" into .cargo-ok, it would actually replace the first two bytes of the file the symlink pointed to with ok. This would allow an attacker to corrupt one file on the machine using Cargo to extract the package. Note that by design Cargo allows code execution at build time, due to build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerabilities in this advisory allow performing a subset of the possible damage in a harder to track down way. Your dependencies must still be trusted if you want to be protected from attacks, as it's possible to perform the same attacks with build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerability is present in all versions of Cargo. Rust 1.64, to be released on September 22nd, will include a fix for it. Since the vulnerability is just a more limited way to accomplish what a malicious build scripts or procedural macros can do, we decided not to publish Rust point releases backporting the security fix. Patch files are available for Rust 1.63.0 are available in the wg-security-response repository for people building their own toolchain. Mitigations We recommend users of alternate registries to exercise care in which package they download, by only including trusted dependencies in their projects. Please note that even with these vulnerabilities fixed, by design Cargo allows arbitrary code execution at build time thanks to build scripts and procedural macros: a malicious dependency will be able to cause damage regardless of these vulnerabilities. crates.io implemented server-side checks to reject these kinds of packages years ago, and there are no packages on crates.io exploiting these vulnerabilities. crates.io users still need to exercise care in choosing their dependencies though, as remote code execution is allowed by design there as well.\n\n- CVE-2022-24904: Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with version 0.7.0 and prior to versions 2.1.15m 2.2.9, and 2.3.4 is vulnerable to a symlink following bug allowing a malicious user with repository write access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user with write access for a repository which is (or may be) used in a directory-type Application may commit a symlink which points to an out-of-bounds file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include manifest files from other Applications' source repositories (potentially decrypted files, if you are using a decryption plugin) or any JSON-formatted secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.4, 2.2.9, and 2.1.15. Users of versions 2.3.0 or above who do not have any Jsonnet/directory-type Applications may disable the Jsonnet/directory config management tool as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-35631: On MacOS and Linux, it may be possible to perform a symlink attack by replacing this predictable file name with a symlink to another file and have the Velociraptor client overwrite the other file. This issue was resolved in Velociraptor 0.6.5-2.\n\n- CVE-2022-45440: A vulnerability exists in the FTP server of the Zyxel AX7501-B0 firmware prior to V5.17(ABPC.3)C0, which processes symbolic links on external storage media. A local authenticated attacker with administrator privileges could abuse this vulnerability to access the root file system by creating a symbolic link on external storage media, such as a USB flash drive, and then logging into the FTP server on a vulnerable device.\n\n- CVE-2022-21944: A UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following vulnerability in the systemd service file for watchman of openSUSE Backports SLE-15-SP3, Factory allows local attackers to escalate to root. This issue affects: openSUSE Backports SLE-15-SP3 watchman versions prior to 4.9.0. openSUSE Factory watchman versions prior to 4.9.0-9.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-31250: A UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following vulnerability in keylime of openSUSE Tumbleweed allows local attackers to escalate from the keylime user to root.

CWE-705 (Incorrect Control Flow Scoping) -> CWE-561 (Dead Code) -> CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) -> CWE-393 (Return of Wrong Status Code) -> CWE-300 (Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint).\n\n- CVE-2000-1218: DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query, leading to cache poisoning\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-29416: An issue was discovered in PortSwigger Burp Suite before 2021.2. During viewing of a malicious request, it can be manipulated into issuing a request that does not respect its upstream proxy configuration. This could leak NetNTLM hashes on Windows systems that fail to block outbound SMB.\n\n- CVE-2021-30127: TerraMaster F2-210 devices through 2021-04-03 use UPnP to make the admin web server accessible over the Internet on TCP port 8181, which is arguably inconsistent with the \"It is only available on the local network\" documentation. NOTE: manually editing /etc/upnp.json provides a partial but undocumented workaround.\n\n- CVE-2021-31810: An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.6.7, 2.7.x through 2.7.3, and 3.x through 3.0.1. A malicious FTP server can use the PASV response to trick Net::FTP into connecting back to a given IP address and port. This potentially makes curl extract information about services that are otherwise private and not disclosed (e.g., the attacker can conduct port scans and service banner extractions).\n\n- CVE-2021-20999: In Weidm\u00fcller u-controls and IoT-Gateways in versions up to 1.12.1 a network port intended only for device-internal usage is accidentally accessible via external network interfaces. By exploiting this vulnerability the device may be manipulated or the operation may be stopped.\n\n- CVE-2021-21210: Inappropriate implementation in Network in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.72 allowed a remote attacker to potentially access local UDP ports via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-42343: An issue was discovered in the Dask distributed package before 2021.10.0 for Python. Single machine Dask clusters started with dask.distributed.LocalCluster or dask.distributed.Client (which defaults to using LocalCluster) would mistakenly configure their respective Dask workers to listen on external interfaces (typically with a randomly selected high port) rather than only on localhost. A Dask cluster created using this method (when running on a machine that has an applicable port exposed) could be used by a sophisticated attacker to achieve remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2021-22916: In Brave Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.26.60, when adblocking is enabled and a proxy browser extension is installed, the CNAME adblocking feature issues DNS requests that used the system DNS settings instead of the extension's proxy settings, resulting in possible information disclosure.\n\n- CVE-2021-22917: Brave Browser Desktop between versions 1.17 and 1.20 is vulnerable to information disclosure by way of DNS requests in Tor windows not flowing through Tor if adblocking was enabled.\n\n- CVE-2020-4062: In Conjur OSS Helm Chart before 2.0.0, a recently identified critical vulnerability resulted in the installation of the Conjur Postgres database with an open port. This allows an attacker to gain full read & write access to the Conjur Postgres database, including escalating the attacker's privileges to assume full control. A malicious actor who knows the IP address and port number of the Postgres database and has access into the Kubernetes cluster where Conjur runs can gain full read & write access to the Postgres database. This enables the attacker to write a policy that allows full access to retrieve any secret. This Helm chart is a method to install Conjur OSS into a Kubernetes environment. Hence, the systems impacted are only Conjur OSS systems that were deployed using this chart. Other deployments including Docker and the CyberArk Dynamic Access Provider (DAP) are not affected. To remediate this vulnerability, clone the latest Helm Chart and follow the upgrade instructions. If you are not able to fully remediate this vulnerability immediately, you can mitigate some of the risk by making sure Conjur OSS is deployed on an isolated Kubernetes cluster or namespace. The term \"isolated\" refers to: - No other workloads besides Conjur OSS and its backend database are running in that Kubernetes cluster/namespace. - Kubernetes and helm access to the cluster/namespace is limited to security administrators via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).\n\n- CVE-2020-10087: GitLab before 12.8.2 allows Information Disclosure. Badge images were not being proxied, causing mixed content warnings as well as leaking the IP address of the user.\n\n- CVE-2021-32690: Helm is a tool for managing Charts (packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources). In versions of helm prior to 3.6.1, a vulnerability exists where the username and password credentials associated with a Helm repository could be passed on to another domain referenced by that Helm repository. This issue has been resolved in 3.6.1. There is a workaround through which one may check for improperly passed credentials. One may use a username and password for a Helm repository and may audit the Helm repository in order to check for another domain being used that could have received the credentials. In the `index.yaml` file for that repository, one may look for another domain in the `urls` list for the chart versions. If there is another domain found and that chart version was pulled or installed, the credentials would be passed on.\n\n- CVE-2021-32707: Nextcloud Mail is a mail app for Nextcloud. In versions prior to 1.9.6, the Nextcloud Mail application does not, by default, render images in emails to not leak the read state. The privacy filter failed to filter images with a `background-image` CSS attribute. Note that the images were still passed through the Nextcloud image proxy, and thus there was no IP leakage. The issue was patched in version 1.9.6 and 1.10.0. No workarounds are known to exist.\n\n- CVE-2020-14312: A flaw was found in the default configuration of dnsmasq, as shipped with Fedora versions prior to 31 and in all versions Red Hat Enterprise Linux, where it listens on any interface and accepts queries from addresses outside of its local subnet. In particular, the option `local-service` is not enabled. Running dnsmasq in this manner may inadvertently make it an open resolver accessible from any address on the internet. This flaw allows an attacker to conduct a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against other systems.\n\n- CVE-2021-20149: Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 does not have sufficient access controls for the WAN interface. The default iptables ruleset for governing access to services on the device only apply to IPv4. All services running on the devices are accessible via the WAN interface via IPv6 by default.\n\n- CVE-2020-1938: When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations.\n\n- CVE-2022-22547: Simple Diagnostics Agent - versions 1.0 (up to version 1.57.), allows an attacker to access information which would otherwise be restricted via a random port 9000-65535. This allows information gathering which could be used exploit future open-source security exploits.\n\n- CVE-2022-44784: An issue was discovered in Appalti & Contratti 9.12.2. The target web applications LFS and DL229 expose a set of services provided by the Axis 1.4 instance, embedded directly into the applications, as hinted by the WEB-INF/web.xml file leaked through Local File Inclusion. Among the exposed services, there is the Axis AdminService, which, through the default configuration, should normally be accessible only by the localhost. Nevertheless, by trying to access the mentioned service, both in LFS and DL229, the service can actually be reached even by remote users, allowing creation of arbitrary services on the server side. When an attacker can reach the AdminService, they can use it to instantiate arbitrary services on the server. The exploit procedure is well known and described in Generic AXIS-SSRF exploitation. Basically, the attack consists of writing a JSP page inside the root directory of the web application, through the org.apache.axis.handlers.LogHandler class.\n\n- CVE-2022-26834: Improper access control vulnerability in Rakuten Casa version AP_F_V1_4_1 or AP_F_V2_0_0 allows a remote attacker to obtain the information stored in the product because the product is set to accept HTTP connections from the WAN side by default.\n\n- CVE-2022-4390: A network misconfiguration is present in versions prior to 1.0.9.90 of the NETGEAR RAX30 AX2400 series of routers. IPv6 is enabled for the WAN interface by default on these devices. While there are firewall restrictions in place that define access restrictions for IPv4 traffic, these restrictions do not appear to be applied to the WAN interface for IPv6. This allows arbitrary access to any services running on the device that may be inadvertently listening via IPv6, such as the SSH and Telnet servers spawned on ports 22 and 23 by default. This misconfiguration could allow an attacker to interact with services only intended to be accessible by clients on the local network.\n\n- CVE-2022-45414: If a Thunderbird user quoted from an HTML email, for example by replying to the email, and the email contained either a VIDEO tag with the POSTER attribute or an OBJECT tag with a DATA attribute, a network request to the referenced remote URL was performed, regardless of a configuration to block remote content. An image loaded from the POSTER attribute was shown in the composer window. These issues could have given an attacker additional capabilities when targetting releases that did not yet have a fix for CVE-2022-3033 which was reported around three months ago. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102.5.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-47717: Last Yard 22.09.8-1 is vulnerable to Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).\n\n- CVE-2022-3057: Inappropriate implementation in iframe Sandbox in Google Chrome prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-31055: kCTF is a Kubernetes-based infrastructure for capture the flag (CTF) competitions. Prior to version 1.6.0, the kctf cluster set-src-ip-ranges was broken and allowed traffic from any IP. The problem has been patched in v1.6.0. As a workaround, those who want to test challenges privately can mark them as `public: false` and use `kctf chal debug port-forward` to connect.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-284 (ChildOf)",

The TCP header processing code doesn't sanitize the value of the IP total length field (header length + data length). With a crafted IP packet, an integer overflow occurs whenever the value of the IP data length is calculated by subtracting the length of the header from the total length of the IP packet.\n\n- CVE-2021-31802: NETGEAR R7000 1.0.11.116 devices have a heap-based Buffer Overflow that is exploitable from the local network without authentication. The vulnerability exists within the handling of an HTTP request. An attacker can leverage this to execute code as root. The problem is that a user-provided length value is trusted during a backup.cgi file upload. The attacker must add a \\\\n before the Content-Length header.\n\n- CVE-2021-37663: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions due to incomplete validation in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeV2`, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/84d053187cb80d975ef2b9684d4b61981bca0c41/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_op.cc#L59) has some validation but does not check that `min_range` and `max_range` both have the same non-zero number of elements. If `axis` is provided (i.e., not `-1`), then validation should check that it is a value in range for the rank of `input` tensor and then the lengths of `min_range` and `max_range` inputs match the `axis` dimension of the `input` tensor. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 6da6620efad397c85493b8f8667b821403516708. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-37665: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions due to incomplete validation in MKL implementation of requantization, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/mkl/mkl_requantization_range_per_channel_op.cc) does not validate the dimensions of the `input` tensor. A similar issue occurs in `MklRequantizePerChannelOp`. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/mkl/mkl_requantize_per_channel_op.cc) does not perform full validation for all the input arguments. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 9e62869465573cb2d9b5053f1fa02a81fce21d69 and in the Github commit 203214568f5bc237603dbab6e1fd389f1572f5c9. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-3655: A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in versions prior to v5.14-rc1. Missing size validations on inbound SCTP packets may allow the kernel to read uninitialized memory.\n\n- CVE-2021-21404: Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program. In Syncthing before version 1.15.0, the relay server `strelaysrv` can be caused to crash and exit by sending a relay message with a negative length field. Similarly, Syncthing itself can crash for the same reason if given a malformed message from a malicious relay server when attempting to join the relay. Relay joins are essentially random (from a subset of low latency relays) and Syncthing will by default restart when crashing, at which point it's likely to pick another non-malicious relay. This flaw is fixed in version 1.15.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-1903: Possible denial of service scenario can occur due to lack of length check on Channel Switch Announcement IE in beacon or probe response frame in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer Electronics Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wired Infrastructure and Networking\n\n- CVE-2021-23906: An issue was discovered in the Headunit NTG6 in the MBUX Infotainment System on Mercedes-Benz vehicles through 2021. A Message Length is not checked in the HiQnet Protocol, leading to remote code execution.\n\n- CVE-2021-31555: An issue was discovered in the Oauth extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. It did not validate the oarc_version (aka oauth_registered_consumer.oarc_version) parameter's length.\n\n- CVE-2021-33196: In archive/zip in Go before 1.15.13 and 1.16.x before 1.16.5, a crafted file count (in an archive's header) can cause a NewReader or OpenReader panic.\n\n- CVE-2021-33609: Missing check in DataCommunicator class in com.vaadin:vaadin-server versions 8.0.0 through 8.14.0 (Vaadin 8.0.0 through 8.14.0) allows authenticated network attacker to cause heap exhaustion by requesting too many rows of data.\n\n- CVE-2021-35041: The blockchain node in FISCO-BCOS V2.7.2 may have a bug when dealing with unformatted packet and lead to a crash. A malicious node can send a packet continuously. The packet is in an incorrect format and cannot be decoded by the node correctly. As a result, the node may consume the memory sustainably and crash. More details are shown at: https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS/issues/1951\n\n- CVE-2020-7459: In FreeBSD 12.1-STABLE before r362166, 12.1-RELEASE before p8, 11.4-STABLE before r362167, 11.4-RELEASE before p2, and 11.3-RELEASE before p12, missing length validation code common to mulitple USB network drivers allows a malicious USB device to write beyond the end of an allocated network packet buffer.\n\n- CVE-2021-1084: NVIDIA vGPU driver contains a vulnerability in the guest kernel mode driver and Virtual GPU Manager (vGPU plugin), in which an input length is not validated, which may lead to information disclosure, tampering of data or denial of service. This affects vGPU version 12.x (prior to 12.2) and version 11.x (prior to 11.4).\n\n- CVE-2021-1097: NVIDIA vGPU software contains a vulnerability in the Virtual GPU Manager (vGPU plugin), where it improperly validates the length field in a request from a guest. This flaw allows a malicious guest to send a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the input, which may lead to information disclosure, data tampering, or denial of service. This affects vGPU version 12.x (prior to 12.3), version 11.x (prior to 11.5) and version 8.x (prior 8.8).\n\n- CVE-2021-20252: A flaw was found in Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform 2. The 3scale backend does not perform preventive handling on user-requested date ranges in certain queries allowing a malicious authenticated user to submit a request with a sufficiently large date range to eventually yield an internal server error resulting in denial of service.

Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-25727: Memory Corruption in modem due to improper length check while copying into memory in Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Voice & Music\n\n- CVE-2022-25793: A Stack-based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in Autodesk 3ds Max 2022, 2021, and 2020 may lead to code execution through the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer when parsing ActionScript Byte Code files.

Azure RTOS USBX implementation of host support for USB CDC ECM includes an integer underflow and a buffer overflow in the `_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function which may be potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution or denial of service. Setting mac address string descriptor length to a `0` or `1` allows an attacker to introduce an integer underflow followed (string_length) by a buffer overflow of the `cdc_ecm -> ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id` array. This may allow one to redirect the code execution flow or introduce a denial of service. The fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel). Improved mac address string descriptor length validation to check for unexpectedly small values may be used as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-36620: D-link DIR-816 A2_v1.10CNB04, DIR-878 DIR_878_FW1.30B08.img is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via /goform/addRouting.\n\n- CVE-2022-37134: D-link DIR-816 A2_v1.10CNB04.img is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via /goform/form2Wan.cgi.

Prior to version 0.10.2, the heap initialization methods were missing a minimum size check for the given heap size argument. This could lead to out-of-bound writes when a heap was initialized with a size smaller than `3 * size_of::<usize>` because of metadata write operations. This vulnerability impacts all the initialization functions on the `Heap` and `LockedHeap` types, including `Heap::new`, `Heap::init`, `Heap::init_from_slice`, and `LockedHeap::new`. It also affects multiple uses of the `Heap::extend` method. Version 0.10.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, ensure that the heap is only initialized with a size larger than `3 * size_of::<usize>` and that the `Heap::extend` method is only called with sizes larger than `2 * size_of::<usize>()`. Also, ensure that the total heap size is (and stays) a multiple of `2 * size_of::<usize>()`.\n\n- CVE-2022-36938: DexLoader function get_stringidx_fromdex() in Redex prior to commit 3b44c64 can load an out of bound address when loading the string index table, potentially allowing remote code execution during processing of a 3rd party Android APK file.\n\n- CVE-2021-1058: NVIDIA vGPU software contains a vulnerability in the guest kernel mode driver and vGPU plugin, in which an input data size is not validated, which may lead to tampering of data or denial of service.

This crash affects the availability of the software and dependent downstream components.\n\n- CVE-2022-23580: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. During shape inference, TensorFlow can allocate a large vector based on a value from a tensor controlled by the user. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-29202: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.ragged.constant` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a denial of service by consuming all available memory. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36078: Binary provides encoding/decoding in Borsh and other formats. The vulnerability is a memory allocation vulnerability that can be exploited to allocate slices in memory with (arbitrary) excessive size value, which can either exhaust available memory or crash the whole program. When using `github.com/gagliardetto/binary` to parse unchecked (or wrong type of) data from untrusted sources of input (e.g. the blockchain) into slices, it's possible to allocate memory with excessive size. When `dec.Decode(&val)` method is used to parse data into a structure that is or contains slices of values, the length of the slice was previously read directly from the data itself without any checks on the size of it, and then a slice was allocated. This could lead to an overflow and an allocation of memory with excessive size value. Users should upgrade to `v0.7.1` or higher. A workaround is not to rely on the `dec.Decode(&val)` function to parse the data, but to use a custom `UnmarshalWithDecoder()` method that reads and checks the length of any slice.\n\n- CVE-2022-37311: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large location request parameter to the redirect servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-37312: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large request body containing a redirect URL to the deferrer servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-39294: conduit-hyper integrates a conduit application with the hyper server. Prior to version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` did not check any limit on a request's length before calling [`hyper::body::to_bytes`](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/body/fn.to_bytes.html). An attacker could send a malicious request with an abnormally large `Content-Length`, which could lead to a panic if memory allocation failed for that request. In version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` sets an internal limit of 128 MiB per request, otherwise returning status 400 (\"Bad Request\"). This crate is part of the implementation of Rust's [crates.io](https://crates.io/), but that service is not affected due to its existing cloud infrastructure, which already drops such malicious requests. Even with the new limit in place, `conduit-hyper` is not recommended for production use, nor to directly serve the public Internet.\n\n- CVE-2022-4111: Unrestricted file size limit can lead to DoS in tooljet/tooljet <1.27 by allowing a logged in attacker to upload profile pictures over 2MB. \n\n- CVE-2022-41968: Nextcloud Server is an open source personal cloud server. Prior to versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.5, calendar name lengths are not validated before writing to a database. As a result, an attacker can send unnecessary amounts of data against the database. Version 23.0.10 and 24.0.5 contain patches for the issue. No known workarounds are available.\n\n- CVE-2022-20488: In NotificationChannel of NotificationChannel.java, there is a possible failure to persist permissions settings due to resource exhaustion. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-12 Android-12L Android-13Android ID: A-242703217\n\n- CVE-2022-20491: In NotificationChannel of NotificationChannel.java, there is a possible failure to persist permissions settings due to resource exhaustion.

This vulnerability is due to missing length validation of certain Cisco Discovery Protocol packet header fields. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to exhaust available memory and cause the service to restart. Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability. \n\n- CVE-2022-21208: The package node-opcua before 2.74.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to a missing limitation on the number of received chunks - per single session or in total for all concurrent sessions. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending an unlimited number of huge chunks (e.g. 2GB each) without sending the Final closing chunk.\n\n- CVE-2022-29212: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, certain TFLite models that were created using TFLite model converter would crash when loaded in the TFLite interpreter. The culprit is that during quantization the scale of values could be greater than 1 but code was always assuming sub-unit scaling. Thus, since code was calling `QuantizeMultiplierSmallerThanOneExp`, the `TFLITE_CHECK_LT` assertion would trigger and abort the process. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29196: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackpropFilterV2` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate that the `filter_sizes` argument is a vector. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29200: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.LSTMBlockCell` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate the ranks of any of the arguments to this API call. This results in `CHECK`-failures when the elements of the tensor are accessed. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-789 (CanPrecede)",

If the token cannot match, the engine \"backtracks\" to a position that may result in a different token that can match.\n Backtracking becomes a weakness if all of these conditions are met:\n\n\n  - The number of possible backtracking attempts are exponential relative to the length of the input.\n\n  - The input can fail to match the regular expression.\n\n  - The input can be long enough.\n\n Attackers can create crafted inputs that intentionally cause the regular expression to use excessive backtracking in a way that causes the CPU consumption to spike. \n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-5243: server allows ReDOS with crafted User-Agent strings, due to overlapping capture groups that cause excessive backtracking.\n\n- CVE-2021-21317: npm package for user-agent parser prone to ReDoS due to overlapping capture groups\n\n- CVE-2019-16215: Markdown parser uses inefficient regex when processing a message, allowing users to cause CPU consumption and delay preventing processing of other messages.\n\n- CVE-2019-6785: Long string in a version control product allows DoS due to an inefficient regex.\n\n- CVE-2019-12041: Javascript code allows ReDoS via a long string due to excessive backtracking.\n\n- CVE-2015-8315: ReDoS when parsing time.\n\n- CVE-2015-8854: ReDoS when parsing documents.\n\n- CVE-2017-16021: ReDoS when validating URL.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-32740: Addressable is an alternative implementation to the URI implementation that is part of Ruby's standard library. An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability exists after version 2.3.0 through version 2.7.0. Within the URI template implementation in Addressable, a maliciously crafted template may result in uncontrolled resource consumption, leading to denial of service when matched against a URI. In typical usage, templates would not normally be read from untrusted user input, but nonetheless, no previous security advisory for Addressable has cautioned against doing this. Users of the parsing capabilities in Addressable but not the URI template capabilities are unaffected. The vulnerability is patched in version 2.8.0. As a workaround, only create Template objects from trusted sources that have been validated not to produce catastrophic backtracking.\n\n- CVE-2021-32763: OpenProject is open-source, web-based project management software. In versions prior to 11.3.3, the `MessagesController` class of OpenProject has a `quote` method that implements the logic behind the Quote button in the discussion forums, and it uses a regex to strip `<pre>` tags from the message being quoted. The `(.|\\\\s)` part can match a space character in two ways, so an unterminated `<pre>` tag containing `n` spaces causes Ruby's regex engine to backtrack to try 2<sup>n</sup> states in the NFA. This will result in a Regular Expression Denial of Service. The issue is fixed in OpenProject 11.3.3. As a workaround, one may install the patch manually.\n\n- CVE-2021-32838: Flask-RESTX (pypi package flask-restx) is a community driven fork of Flask-RESTPlus.

This has been resolved in version 3.3.6. If you are unable to update you may also set `$wgDplSettings['functionalRichness'] = 0;` or disable DynamicPageList3 to mitigate.\n\n- CVE-2021-41186: Fluentd collects events from various data sources and writes them to files to help unify logging infrastructure. The parser_apache2 plugin in Fluentd v0.14.14 to v1.14.1 suffers from a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability. A broken apache log with a certain pattern of string can spend too much time in a regular expression, resulting in the potential for a DoS attack. This issue is patched in version 1.14.2 There are two workarounds available. Either don't use parser_apache2 for parsing logs (which cannot guarantee generated by Apache), or put patched version of parser_apache2.rb into /etc/fluent/plugin directory (or any other directories specified by the environment variable `FLUENT_PLUGIN` or `--plugin` option of fluentd).\n\n- CVE-2021-42836: GJSON before 1.9.3 allows a ReDoS (regular expression denial of service) attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-44686: calibre before 5.32.0 contains a regular expression that is vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) in html_preprocess_rules in ebooks/conversion/preprocess.py.\n\n- CVE-2020-1920: A regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the validateBaseUrl function can cause the application to use excessive resources, become unresponsive, or crash.

It affects all users using CKEditor 5 Markdown plugin at version <= 24.0.0. The problem has been recognized and patched. The fix will be available in version 25.0.0.\n\n- CVE-2021-21267: Schema-Inspector is an open-source tool to sanitize and validate JS objects (npm package schema-inspector). In before version 2.0.0, email address validation is vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack where some input (for example `a@0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.`) will freeze the program or web browser page executing the code. This affects any current schema-inspector users using any version to validate email addresses. Users who do not do email validation, and instead do other types of validation (like string min or max length, etc), are not affected. Users should upgrade to version 2.0.0, which uses a regex expression that isn't vulnerable to ReDoS.\n\n- CVE-2021-21306: Marked is an open-source markdown parser and compiler (npm package \"marked\"). In marked from version 1.1.1 and before version 2.0.0, there is a Regular expression Denial of Service vulnerability. This vulnerability can affect anyone who runs user generated code through marked.

The maintainers found the patch for CVE-2021-43838 in jsx-slack v4.5.1 is insufficient tfor protection from a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. If an attacker can put a lot of JSX elements into `<blockquote>` tag _with including multibyte characters_, an internal regular expression for escaping characters may consume an excessive amount of computing resources. v4.5.1 passes the test against ASCII characters but misses the case of multibyte characters. jsx-slack v4.5.2 has updated regular expressions for escaping blockquote characters to prevent catastrophic backtracking. It is also including an updated test case to confirm rendering multiple tags in `<blockquote>` with multibyte characters.\n\n- CVE-2021-3733: There's a flaw in urllib's AbstractBasicAuthHandler class. An attacker who controls a malicious HTTP server that an HTTP client (such as web browser) connects to, could trigger a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDOS) during an authentication request with a specially crafted payload that is sent by the server to the client. The greatest threat that this flaw poses is to application availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-38244: A regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability exits in cbioportal 3.6.21 and older via a POST request to /ProteinArraySignificanceTest.json.\n\n- CVE-2021-39917: An issue has been discovered in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 12.9 before 14.3.6, all versions starting from 14.4 before 14.4.4, all versions starting from 14.5 before 14.5.2. A regular expression related to quick actions features was susceptible to catastrophic backtracking that could cause a DOS attack.\n\n- CVE-2021-43854: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a suite of open source Python modules, data sets, and tutorials supporting research and development in Natural Language Processing. Versions prior to 3.6.5 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. The vulnerability is present in PunktSentenceTokenizer, sent_tokenize and word_tokenize. Any users of this class, or these two functions, are vulnerable to the ReDoS attack. In short, a specifically crafted long input to any of these vulnerable functions will cause them to take a significant amount of execution time. If your program relies on any of the vulnerable functions for tokenizing unpredictable user input, then we would strongly recommend upgrading to a version of NLTK without the vulnerability. For users unable to upgrade the execution time can be bounded by limiting the maximum length of an input to any of the vulnerable functions. Our recommendation is to implement such a limit.\n\n- CVE-2021-23354: The package printf before 0.6.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the regex string /\\\\%(?:\\\\(([\\\\w_.]+)\\\\)|([1-9]\\\\d*)\\\\$)?([0 +\\\\-\\\\]*)(\\\\*|\\\\d+)?(\\\\.)?(\\\\*|\\\\d+)?[hlL]?([\\\\%bscdeEfFgGioOuxX])/g in lib/printf.js.

In affected versions Zulip allows organization administrators on a server to configure \"linkifiers\" that automatically create links from messages that users send, detected via arbitrary regular expressions. Malicious organization administrators could subject the server to a denial-of-service via regular expression complexity attacks; most simply, by configuring a quadratic-time regular expression in a linkifier, and sending messages that exploited it. A regular expression attempted to parse the user-provided regexes to verify that they were safe from ReDoS -- this was both insufficient, as well as _itself_ subject to ReDoS if the organization administrator entered a sufficiently complex invalid regex. Affected users should [upgrade to the just-released Zulip 4.7](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release), or [`main`](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-from-a-git-repository).\n\n- CVE-2021-41817: Date.parse in the date gem through 3.2.0 for Ruby allows ReDoS (regular expression Denial of Service) via a long string. The fixed versions are 3.2.1, 3.1.2, 3.0.2, and 2.0.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-43306: An exponential ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) can be triggered in the jquery-validation npm package, when an attacker is able to supply arbitrary input to the url2 method\n\n- CVE-2021-43307: An exponential ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) can be triggered in the semver-regex npm package, when an attacker is able to supply arbitrary input to the test() method\n\n- CVE-2021-43308: An exponential ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) can be triggered in the markdown-link-extractor npm package, when an attacker is able to supply arbitrary input to the module's exported function\n\n- CVE-2021-43309: An exponential ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) can be triggered in the uri-template-lite npm package, when an attacker is able to supply arbitrary input to the \"URI.expand\" method\n\n- CVE-2021-43838: jsx-slack is a library for building JSON objects for Slack Block Kit surfaces from JSX. In versions prior to 4.5.1 users are vulnerable to a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) attack. If attacker can put a lot of JSX elements into `<blockquote>` tag, an internal regular expression for escaping characters may consume an excessive amount of computing resources. jsx-slack v4.5.1 has patched to a regex for escaping blockquote characters. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2021-45470: lib/DatabaseLayer.py in cve-search before 4.1.0 allows regular expression injection, which can lead to ReDoS (regular expression denial of service) or other impacts.\n\n- CVE-2021-46823: python-ldap before 3.4.0 is vulnerable to a denial of service when ldap.schema is used for untrusted schema definitions, because of a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) flaw in the LDAP schema parser.

The exploitation of this vulnerability could be triggered via the parse function.\n\n- CVE-2022-21681: Marked is a markdown parser and compiler. Prior to version 4.0.10, the regular expression `inline.reflinkSearch` may cause catastrophic backtracking against some strings and lead to a denial of service (DoS). Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version of marked and does not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is patched in version 4.0.10. As a workaround, avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run marked on a worker thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources.\n\n- CVE-2022-24373: The package react-native-reanimated before 3.0.0-rc.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to improper usage of regular expression in the parser of Colors.js.\n\n- CVE-2022-24713: regex is an implementation of regular expressions for the Rust language. The regex crate features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service attacks caused by untrusted regexes, or untrusted input matched by trusted regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered part of the crate's API. Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing, and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes to services accepting user-controlled, untrusted regexes. All versions of the regex crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this issue. The fix is include starting from regex 1.5.5. All users accepting user-controlled regexes are recommended to upgrade immediately to the latest version of the regex crate. Unfortunately there is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are practically infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability. Because of this, it us not recommend to deny known problematic regexes.\n\n- CVE-2022-25598: Apache DolphinScheduler user registration is vulnerable to Regular express Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks, Apache DolphinScheduler users should upgrade to version 2.0.5 or higher.\n\n- CVE-2022-25758: All versions of package scss-tokenizer are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the loadAnnotation() function, due to the usage of insecure regex.\n\n- CVE-2022-25844: The package angular after 1.7.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) by providing a custom locale rule that makes it possible to assign the parameter in posPre: ' '.repeat() of NUMBER_FORMATS.PATTERNS[1].posPre with a very high value. **Note:** 1) This package has been deprecated and is no longer maintained. 2) The vulnerable versions are 1.7.0 and higher.\n\n- CVE-2022-25858: The package terser before 4.8.1, from 5.0.0 and before 5.14.2 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to insecure usage of regular expressions.\n\n- CVE-2022-25887: The package sanitize-html before 2.7.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to insecure global regular expression replacement logic of HTML comment removal.\n\n- CVE-2022-25918: The package shescape from 1.5.10 and before 1.6.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the escape function in index.js, due to the usage of insecure regex in the escapeArgBash function.\n\n- CVE-2022-29158: Apache OFBiz up to version 18.12.05 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the way it handles URLs provided by external, unauthenticated users. Upgrade to 18.12.06 or apply patches at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ-12599\n\n- CVE-2022-29167: Hawk is an HTTP authentication scheme providing mechanisms for making authenticated HTTP requests with partial cryptographic verification of the request and response, covering the HTTP method, request URI, host, and optionally the request payload. Hawk used a regular expression to parse `Host` HTTP header (`Hawk.utils.parseHost()`), which was subject to regular expression DoS attack - meaning each added character in the attacker's input increases the computation time exponentially. `parseHost()` was patched in `9.0.1` to use built-in `URL` class to parse hostname instead. `Hawk.authenticate()` accepts `options` argument. If that contains `host` and `port`, those would be used instead of a call to `utils.parseHost()`.\n\n- CVE-2022-29169: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions starting with 2.2 and prior to 2.3.19, 2.4.7, and 2.5.0-beta.2 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. By using specific a RegularExpression, an attacker can cause denial of service for the bbb-html5 service. The useragent library performs checking of device by parsing the input of User-Agent header and lets it go through lookupUserAgent() (alias of useragent.lookup() ). This function handles input by regexing and attackers can abuse that by providing some ReDos payload using `SmartWatch`.

Developers can use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login.\n\n- CVE-2021-40654: An information disclosure issue exist in D-LINK-DIR-615 B2 2.01mt.

Invenio-Drafts-Resources prior to versions 0.13.7 and 0.14.6 does not properly check permissions when a record is published. The vulnerability is exploitable in a default installation of InvenioRDM. An authenticated a user is able via REST API calls to publish draft records of other users if they know the record identifier and the draft validates (e.g. all require fields filled out). An attacker is not able to modify the data in the record, and thus e.g. *cannot* change a record from restricted to public. The problem is patched in Invenio-Drafts-Resources v0.13.7 and 0.14.6, which is part of InvenioRDM v6.0.1 and InvenioRDM v7.0 respectively.\n\n- CVE-2020-11628: An issue was discovered in EJBCA before 6.15.2.6 and 7.x before 7.3.1.2.

(The target Issues can have Private view status, or belong to a private Project.)\n\n- CVE-2021-1144: A vulnerability in Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) could allow a remote, authenticated attacker without administrative privileges to alter the password of any user on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of authorization checks for changing a password. An authenticated attacker without administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability by sending a modified HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the passwords of any user on the system, including an administrative user, and then impersonate that user.\n\n- CVE-2021-1539: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-1540: Multiple vulnerabilities in the authorization process of Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and execute a subset of CLI commands on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-20179: A flaw was found in pki-core. An attacker who has successfully compromised a key could use this flaw to renew the corresponding certificate over and over again, as long as it is not explicitly revoked. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-20188: A flaw was found in podman before 1.7.0. File permissions for non-root users running in a privileged container are not correctly checked. This flaw can be abused by a low-privileged user inside the container to access any other file in the container, even if owned by the root user inside the container. It does not allow to directly escape the container, though being a privileged container means that a lot of security features are disabled when running the container. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-20229: A flaw was found in PostgreSQL in versions before 13.2. This flaw allows a user with SELECT privilege on one column to craft a special query that returns all columns of the table. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2021-20282: When creating a user account, it was possible to verify the account without having access to the verification email link/secret in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2021-21182: Insufficient policy enforcement in navigations in Google Chrome prior to 89.0.4389.72 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-21228: Insufficient policy enforcement in extensions in Google Chrome prior to 90.0.4430.93 allowed an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted Chrome Extension.\n\n- CVE-2021-21318: Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of educational audio and video content. In Opencast before version 9.2 there is a vulnerability in which publishing an episode with strict access rules will overwrite the currently set series access. This allows for an easy denial of access for all users without superuser privileges, effectively hiding the series. Access to series and series metadata on the search service (shown in media module and player) depends on the events published which are part of the series. Publishing an event will automatically publish a series and update access to it. Removing an event or republishing the event should do the same. Affected versions of Opencast may not update the series access or remove a published series if an event is being removed. On removal of an episode, this may lead to an access control list for series metadata with broader access rules than the merged access rules of all remaining events, or the series metadata still being available although all episodes of that series have been removed. This problem is fixed in Opencast 9.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-21367: Switchboard Bluetooth Plug for elementary OS from version 2.3.0 and before version version 2.3.5 has an incorrect authorization vulnerability. When the Bluetooth plug is running (in discoverable mode), Bluetooth service requests and pairing requests are automatically accepted, allowing physically proximate attackers to pair with a device running an affected version of switchboard-plug-bluetooth without the active consent of the user. By default, elementary OS doesn't expose any services via Bluetooth that allow information to be extracted by paired Bluetooth devices. However, if such services (i.e. contact list sharing software) have been installed, it's possible that attackers have been able to extract data from such services without authorization. If no such services have been installed, attackers are only able to pair with a device running an affected version without authorization and then play audio out of the device or possibly present a HID device (keyboard, mouse, etc...) to control the device. As such, users should check the list of trusted/paired devices and remove any that are not 100% confirmed to be genuine. This is fixed in version 2.3.5. To reduce the likelihood of this vulnerability on an unpatched version, only open the Bluetooth plug for short intervals when absolutely necessary and preferably not in crowded public areas. To mitigate the risk entirely with unpatched versions, do not open the Bluetooth plug within switchboard at all, and use a different method for pairing devices if necessary (e.g. `bluetoothctl` CLI).\n\n- CVE-2021-21389: BuddyPress is an open source WordPress plugin to build a community site. In releases of BuddyPress from 5.0.0 before 7.2.1 it's possible for a non-privileged, regular user to obtain administrator rights by exploiting an issue in the REST API members endpoint. The vulnerability has been fixed in BuddyPress 7.2.1. Existing installations of the plugin should be updated to this version to mitigate the issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-21411: OAuth2-Proxy is an open source reverse proxy that provides authentication with Google, Github or other providers. The `--gitlab-group` flag for group-based authorization in the GitLab provider stopped working in the v7.0.0 release. Regardless of the flag settings, authorization wasn't restricted. Additionally, any authenticated users had whichever groups were set in `--gitlab-group` added to the new `X-Forwarded-Groups` header to the upstream application. While adding GitLab project based authorization support in #630, a bug was introduced where the user session's groups field was populated with the `--gitlab-group` config entries instead of pulling the individual user's group membership from the GitLab Userinfo endpoint. When the session groups where compared against the allowed groups for authorization, they matched improperly (since both lists were populated with the same data) so authorization was allowed. This impacts GitLab Provider users who relies on group membership for authorization restrictions. Any authenticated users in your GitLab environment can access your applications regardless of `--gitlab-group` membership restrictions. This is patched in v7.1.0. There is no workaround for the Group membership bug. But `--gitlab-project` can be set to use Project membership as the authorization checks instead of groups; it is not broken.\n\n- CVE-2021-21609: Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not correctly match requested URLs to the list of always accessible paths, allowing attackers without Overall/Read permission to access some URLs as if they did have Overall/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21643: Jenkins Config File Provider Plugin 3.7.0 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints, allowing attackers with global Job/Configure permission to enumerate system-scoped credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\n- CVE-2021-21670: Jenkins 2.299 and earlier, LTS 2.289.1 and earlier allows users to cancel queue items and abort builds of jobs for which they have Item/Cancel permission even when they do not have Item/Read permission.\n\n- CVE-2021-21692: FilePath#renameTo and FilePath#moveAllChildrenTo in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier only check 'read' agent-to-controller access permission on the source path, instead of 'delete'.\n\n- CVE-2021-22251: Improper validation of invited users' email address in GitLab EE affecting all versions since 12.2 allowed projects to add members with email address domain that should be blocked by group settings\n\n- CVE-2021-22389: There is a Permission Control Vulnerability in Huawei Smartphone.Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause certain codes to be executed.\n\n- CVE-2021-24244: An AJAX action registered by the WPBakery Page Builder (Visual Composer) Clipboard WordPress plugin before 4.5.8 did not have capability checks, allowing low privilege users, such as subscribers, to update the license options (key, email).\n\n- CVE-2021-24278: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, unauthenticated users can use the wpcf7r_get_nonce AJAX action to retrieve a valid nonce for any WordPress action/function.\n\n- CVE-2021-24279: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, low level users, such as subscribers, could use the import_from_debug AJAX action to install any plugin from the WordPress repository.\n\n- CVE-2021-24281: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the delete_action_post AJAX action to delete any post on a target site.\n\n- CVE-2021-24282: In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the various AJAX actions in the plugin to do a variety of things. For example, an attacker could use wpcf7r_reset_settings to reset the plugin\u2019s settings, wpcf7r_add_action to add actions to a form, and more.\n\n- CVE-2021-24379: The Comments Like Dislike WordPress plugin before 1.1.4 allows users to like/dislike posted comments, however does not prevent them from replaying the AJAX request to add a like. This allows any user (even unauthenticated) to add unlimited like/dislike to any comment. The plugin appears to have some Restriction modes, such as Cookie Restriction, IP Restrictions, Logged In User Restriction, however, they do not prevent such attack as they only check client side\n\n- CVE-2021-24652: The PostX \u2013 Gutenberg Blocks for Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.4.10 performs incorrect checks before allowing any logged in user to perform some ajax based requests, allowing any user to modify, delete or add ultp_options values.\n\n- CVE-2021-24717: The AutomatorWP WordPress plugin before 1.7.6 does not perform capability checks which allows users with Subscriber roles to enumerate automations, disclose title of private posts or user emails, call functions, or perform privilege escalation via Ajax actions.\n\n- CVE-2021-24742: The Logo Slider and Showcase WordPress plugin before 1.3.37 allows Editor users to update the plugin's settings via the rtWLSSettings AJAX action because it uses a nonce for authorisation instead of a capability check.\n\n- CVE-2021-24757: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.0 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users), which could allow unauthenticated users to upload images.\n\n- CVE-2021-24770: The Stylish Price List WordPress plugin before 6.9.1 does not perform capability checks in its spl_upload_ser_img AJAX action (available to authenticated users), which could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber, to upload arbitrary images.\n\n- CVE-2021-25777: In JetBrains TeamCity before 2020.2.1, permissions during token removal were checked improperly.\n\n- CVE-2021-25954: In \u201cDolibarr\u201d application, 2.8.1 to 13.0.4 don\u2019t restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor. A low privileged attacker can modify the Private Note which only an administrator has rights to do, the affected field is at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint.\n\n- CVE-2021-26040: An issue was discovered in Joomla! 4.0.0. The media manager does not correctly check the user's permissions before executing a file deletion command.\n\n- CVE-2021-26563: Incorrect authorization vulnerability in synoagentregisterd in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) before 6.2.4-25553 allows local users to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.\n\n- CVE-2021-28661: Default SilverStripe GraphQL Server (aka silverstripe/graphql) 3.x through 3.4.1 permission checker not inherited by query subclass.\n\n- CVE-2021-28696: IOMMU page mapping issues on x86 T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Both AMD and Intel allow ACPI tables to specify regions of memory which should be left untranslated, which typically means these addresses should pass the translation phase unaltered. While these are typically device specific ACPI properties, they can also be specified to apply to a range of devices, or even all devices. On all systems with such regions Xen failed to prevent guests from undoing/replacing such mappings (CVE-2021-28694). On AMD systems, where a discontinuous range is specified by firmware, the supposedly-excluded middle range will also be identity-mapped (CVE-2021-28695). Further, on AMD systems, upon de-assigment of a physical device from a guest, the identity mappings would be left in place, allowing a guest continued access to ranges of memory which it shouldn't have access to anymore (CVE-2021-28696).\n\n- CVE-2021-29439: The Grav admin plugin prior to version 1.10.11 does not correctly verify caller's privileges. As a consequence, users with the permission `admin.login` can install third-party plugins and their dependencies. By installing the right plugin, an attacker can obtain an arbitrary code execution primitive and elevate their privileges on the instance. The vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.10.11. As a mitigation blocking access to the `/admin` path from untrusted sources will reduce the probability of exploitation. \n\n- CVE-2021-29943: When using ConfigurableInternodeAuthHadoopPlugin for authentication, Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2 would forward/proxy distributed requests using server credentials instead of original client credentials. This would result in incorrect authorization resolution on the receiving hosts.\n\n- CVE-2021-30533: Insufficient policy enforcement in PopupBlocker in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted iframe.\n\n- CVE-2021-30534: Insufficient policy enforcement in iFrameSandbox in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass navigation restrictions via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31158: In the Query Engine in Couchbase Server 6.5.x and 6.6.x through 6.6.1, Common Table Expression queries were not correctly checking the user's permissions, allowing read-access to resources beyond what those users were explicitly allowed to access.\n\n- CVE-2021-31926: AMP Application Deployment Service in CubeCoders AMP 2.1.x before 2.1.1.2 allows a remote, authenticated user to open ports in the local system firewall by crafting an HTTP(S) request directly to the applicable API endpoint (despite not having permission to make changes to the system's network configuration).\n\n- CVE-2021-33718: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 7 (All versions < V7.23.22), Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.7), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.3.0). Write access checks of attributes of an object could be bypassed, if user has a write permissions to the first attribute of this object.\n\n- CVE-2021-34434: In Eclipse Mosquitto versions 2.0 to 2.0.11, when using the dynamic security plugin, if the ability for a client to make subscriptions on a topic is revoked when a durable client is offline, then existing subscriptions for that client are not revoked.\n\n- CVE-2021-35949: The shareinfo controller in the ownCloud Server before 10.8.0 allows an attacker to bypass the permission checks for upload only shares and list metadata about the share.\n\n- CVE-2021-36132: An issue was discovered in the FileImporter extension in MediaWiki through 1.36. For certain relaxed configurations of the $wgFileImporterRequiredRight variable, it might not validate all appropriate user rights, thus allowing a user with insufficient rights to perform operations (specifically file uploads) that they should not be allowed to perform.\n\n- CVE-2021-36230: HashiCorp Terraform Enterprise releases up to v202106-1 did not properly perform authorization checks on a subset of API requests executed using the run token, allowing privilege escalation to organization owner. Fixed in v202107-1.\n\n- CVE-2021-38312: The Gutenberg Template Library & Redux Framework plugin <= 4.2.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check in the REST API endpoints registered under the \u201credux/v1/templates/\u201d REST Route in \u201credux-templates/classes/class-api.php\u201d. The `permissions_callback` used in this file only checked for the `edit_posts` capability which is granted to lower-privileged users such as contributors, allowing such users to install arbitrary plugins from the WordPress repository and edit arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-38345: The Brizy Page Builder plugin <= 2.3.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check that allowed any logged-in user accessing any endpoint in the wp-admin directory to modify the content of any existing post or page created with the Brizy editor. An identical issue was found by another researcher in Brizy <= 1.0.125 and fixed in version 1.0.126, but the vulnerability was reintroduced in version 1.0.127.\n\n- CVE-2021-39321: Version 3.3.23 of the Sassy Social Share WordPress plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection via the wp_ajax_heateor_sss_import_config AJAX action due to deserialization of unvalidated user supplied inputs via the import_config function found in the ~/admin/class-sassy-social-share-admin.php file. This can be exploited by underprivileged authenticated users due to a missing capability check on the import_config function.\n\n- CVE-2021-39902: Incorrect Authorization in GitLab CE/EE 13.4 or above allows a user with guest membership in a project to modify the severity of an incident.\n\n- CVE-2021-41082: Discourse is a platform for community discussion. In affected versions any private message that includes a group had its title and participating user exposed to users that do not have access to the private messages. However, access control for the private messages was not compromised as users were not able to view the posts in the leaked private message despite seeing it in their inbox. The problematic commit was reverted around 32 minutes after it was made. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest commit if they are running Discourse against the `tests-passed` branch.\n\n- CVE-2021-41189: DSpace is an open source turnkey repository application. In version 7.0, any community or collection administrator can escalate their permission up to become system administrator. This vulnerability only exists in 7.0 and does not impact 6.x or below. This issue is patched in version 7.1. As a workaround, users of 7.0 may temporarily disable the ability for community or collection administrators to manage permissions or workflows settings.\n\n- CVE-2021-41230: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. In affected versions changes to the OIDC claims of a user after initial login are not reflected in policy evaluation when using `allowed_idp_claims` as part of policy. If using `allowed_idp_claims` and a user's claims are changed, Pomerium can make incorrect authorization decisions. This issue has been resolved in v0.15.6. For users unable to upgrade clear data on `databroker` service by clearing redis or restarting the in-memory databroker to force claims to be updated.\n\n- CVE-2021-42025: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control write access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to manipulate the content of System.FileDocument objects in some cases, regardless whether they have write access to it.\n\n- CVE-2021-42026: A vulnerability has been identified in Mendix Applications using Mendix 8 (All versions < V8.18.13), Mendix Applications using Mendix 9 (All versions < V9.6.2). Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control read access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to retrieve the changedDate attribute of arbitrary objects, even when they don't have read access to them.\n\n- CVE-2021-43553: PI Vision could disclose information to a user with insufficient privileges for an AF attribute that is the child of another attribute and is configured as a Limits property.\n\n- CVE-2021-29959: When a user has already allowed a website to access microphone and camera, disabling camera sharing would not fully prevent the website from re-enabling it without an additional prompt. This was only possible if the website kept recording with the microphone until re-enabling the camera. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.\n\n- CVE-2021-32701: ORY Oathkeeper is an Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) and Access Control Decision API that authorizes HTTP requests based on sets of Access Rules. When you make a request to an endpoint that requires the scope `foo` using an access token granted with that `foo` scope, introspection will be valid and that token will be cached. The problem comes when a second requests to an endpoint that requires the scope `bar` is made before the cache has expired. Whether the token is granted or not to the `bar` scope, introspection will be valid. A patch will be released with `v0.38.12-beta.1`. Per default, caching is disabled for the `oauth2_introspection` authenticator. When caching is disabled, this vulnerability does not exist. The cache is checked in [`func (a *AuthenticatorOAuth2Introspection) Authenticate(...)`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L152). From [`tokenFromCache()`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L97) it seems that it only validates the token expiration date, but ignores whether the token has or not the proper scopes. The vulnerability was introduced in PR #424. During review, we failed to require appropriate test coverage by the submitter which is the primary reason that the vulnerability passed the review process.\n\n- CVE-2021-20538: IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S) 1.5.0.0 and 1.5.0.1 could allow a user to obtain sensitive information or perform actions they should not have access to due to incorrect authorization mechanisms. IBM X-Force ID: 198919.\n\n- CVE-2021-40504: A certain template role in SAP NetWeaver Application Server for ABAP and ABAP Platform - versions 700, 701, 702, 710, 711, 730, 731, 740, 750, 751, 752, 753, 754, 755, 756, contains transport authorizations, which exceed expected display only permissions.\n\n- CVE-2021-25356: An improper caller check vulnerability in Managed Provisioning prior to SMR APR-2021 Release 1 allows unprivileged application to install arbitrary application, grant device admin permission and then delete several installed application.\n\n- CVE-2021-24783: The Post Expirator WordPress plugin before 2.6.0 does not have proper capability checks in place, which could allow users with a role as low as Contributor to schedule deletion of arbitrary posts.\n\n- CVE-2021-26753: NeDi 1.9C allows an authenticated user to inject PHP code in the System Files function on the endpoint /System-Files.php via the txt HTTP POST parameter. This allows an attacker to obtain access to the operating system where NeDi is installed and to all application data.\n\n- CVE-2021-32829: ZStack is open source IaaS(infrastructure as a service) software aiming to automate datacenters, managing resources of compute, storage, and networking all by APIs. Affected versions of ZStack REST API are vulnerable to post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) via bypass of the Groovy shell sandbox. The REST API exposes the GET zstack/v1/batch-queries?script endpoint which is backed up by the BatchQueryAction class. Messages are represented by the APIBatchQueryMsg, dispatched to the QueryFacadeImpl facade and handled by the BatchQuery class. The HTTP request parameter script is mapped to the APIBatchQueryMsg.script property and evaluated as a Groovy script in BatchQuery.query the evaluation of the user-controlled Groovy script is sandboxed by SandboxTransformer which will apply the restrictions defined in the registered (sandbox.register()) GroovyInterceptor. Even though the sandbox heavily restricts the receiver types to a small set of allowed types, the sandbox is non effective at controlling any code placed in Java annotations and therefore vulnerable to meta-programming escapes. This issue leads to post-authenticated remote code execution. For more details see the referenced GHSL-2021-065. This issue is patched in versions 3.8.21, 3.10.8, and 4.1.0.\n\n- CVE-2020-9381: controllers/admin.js in Total.js CMS 13 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a POST to the /admin/api/widgets/ URI. This can be exploited in conjunction with CVE-2019-15954.\n\n- CVE-2021-26027: An issue was discovered in Joomla! 3.0.0 through 3.9.24. Incorrect ACL checks could allow unauthorized change of the category for an article.\n\n- CVE-2021-36749: In the Druid ingestion system, the InputSource is used for reading data from a certain data source. However, the HTTP InputSource allows authenticated users to read data from other sources than intended, such as the local file system, with the privileges of the Druid server process. This is not an elevation of privilege when users access Druid directly, since Druid also provides the Local InputSource, which allows the same level of access. But it is problematic when users interact with Druid indirectly through an application that allows users to specify the HTTP InputSource, but not the Local InputSource. In this case, users could bypass the application-level restriction by passing a file URL to the HTTP InputSource. This issue was previously mentioned as being fixed in 0.21.0 as per CVE-2021-26920 but was not fixed in 0.21.0 or 0.21.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-43560: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.3, 3.10 to 3.10.7, 3.9 to 3.9.10 and earlier unsupported versions. Insufficient capability checks made it possible to fetch other users' calendar action events.\n\n- CVE-2021-31548: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. A MediaWiki user who is partially blocked or was unsuccessfully blocked could bypass AbuseFilter and have their edits completed.\n\n- CVE-2021-31552: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. It incorrectly executed certain rules related to blocking accounts after account creation. Such rules would allow for user accounts to be created while blocking only the IP address used to create an account (and not the user account itself). Such rules could also be used by a nefarious, unprivileged user to catalog and enumerate any number of IP addresses related to these account creations.\n\n- CVE-2021-31554: An issue was discovered in the AbuseFilter extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. It improperly handled account blocks for certain automatically created MediaWiki user accounts, thus allowing nefarious users to remain unblocked.\n\n- CVE-2021-35197: In MediaWiki before 1.31.15, 1.32.x through 1.35.x before 1.35.3, and 1.36.x before 1.36.1, bots have certain unintended API access. When a bot account has a \"sitewide block\" applied, it is able to still \"purge\" pages through the MediaWiki Action API (which a \"sitewide block\" should have prevented).\n\n- CVE-2020-36289: Affected versions of Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center allow an unauthenticated user to enumerate users via an Information Disclosure vulnerability in the QueryComponentRendererValue!Default.jspa endpoint. The affected versions are before version 8.5.13, from version 8.6.0 before 8.13.5, and from version 8.14.0 before 8.15.1.\n\n- CVE-2021-20281: It was possible for some users without permission to view other users' full names to do so via the online users block in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2020-27362: An issue exists within the SSH console of Akkadian Provisioning Manager 4.50.02 which allows a low-level privileged user to escape the web configuration file editor and escalate privileges.\n\n- CVE-2021-33335: Privilege escalation vulnerability in Liferay Portal 7.0.3 through 7.3.4, and Liferay DXP 7.1 before fix pack 20, and 7.2 before fix pack 9 allows remote authenticated users with permission to update/edit users to take over a company administrator user account by editing the company administrator user.\n\n- CVE-2021-42137: An issue was discovered in Zammad before 5.0.1.

In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the name, avatar, topic and number of members of a room if they know the ID of the room. This vulnerability is limited to homeservers where the vulnerable homeserver is in the room and untrusted users are permitted to create groups (communities). By default, only homeserver administrators can create groups. However, homeserver administrators can already access this information in the database or using the admin API. As a result, only homeservers where the configuration setting `enable_group_creation` has been set to `true` are impacted. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or higher to patch the vulnerability. There are two potential workarounds. Server administrators can set `enable_group_creation` to `false` in their homeserver configuration (this is the default value) to prevent creation of groups by non-administrators. Administrators that are using a reverse proxy could, with partial loss of group functionality, block the endpoints `/_matrix/client/r0/groups/{group_id}/rooms` and `/_matrix/client/unstable/groups/{group_id}/rooms`.\n\n- CVE-2021-39164: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice over IP.

The vulnerability is limited to rooms with `shared` history visibility. Furthermore, the unauthorised user must be using an account on a vulnerable homeserver that is in the room. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or later in order to receive the patch. One workaround is available. Administrators of servers that use a reverse proxy could, with potentially unacceptable loss of functionality, block the endpoints: `/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter, and `/_matrix/client/unstable/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter.\n\n- CVE-2021-0472: In shouldLockKeyguard of LockTaskController.java, there is a possible way to exit App Pinning without a PIN due to a permissions bypass.

This issue is fixed in , 5.2.2.\n\n- CVE-2022-45383: An incorrect permission check in Jenkins Support Core Plugin 1206.v14049fa_b_d860 and earlier allows attackers with Support/DownloadBundle permission to download a previously created support bundle containing information limited to users with Overall/Administer permission.\n\n- CVE-2022-46076: D-Link DIR-869 DIR869Ax_FW102B15 is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass via phpcgi.\n\n- CVE-2021-24917: The WPS Hide Login WordPress plugin before 1.9.1 has a bug which allows to get the secret login page by setting a random referer string and making a request to /wp-admin/options.php as an unauthenticated user.\n\n- CVE-2022-1746: The authentication mechanism used by poll workers to administer voting using the tested version of Dominion Voting Systems ImageCast X can expose cryptographic secrets used to protect election information. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to gain access to sensitive information and perform privileged actions, potentially affecting other election equipment.\n\n- CVE-2022-22967: An issue was discovered in SaltStack Salt in versions before 3002.9, 3003.5, 3004.2. PAM auth fails to reject locked accounts, which allows a previously authorized user whose account is locked still run Salt commands when their account is locked. This affects both local shell accounts with an active session and salt-api users that authenticate via PAM eauth.\n\n- CVE-2022-23822: In this physical attack, an attacker may potentially exploit the Zynq-7000 SoC First Stage Boot Loader (FSBL) by bypassing authentication and loading a malicious image onto the device. This in turn may further allow the attacker to perform additional attacks such as such as using the device as a decryption oracle. An anticipated mitigation via a 2022.1 patch will resolve the issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-24778: The imgcrypt library provides API exensions for containerd to support encrypted container images and implements the ctd-decoder command line tool for use by containerd to decrypt encrypted container images. The imgcrypt function `CheckAuthorization` is supposed to check whether the current used is authorized to access an encrypted image and prevent the user from running an image that another user previously decrypted on the same system. In versions prior to 1.1.4, a failure occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. Only the first architecture in the list was tested, which may not have its layers available locally since it could not be run on the host architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailable layers was that the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur later due to the layers not being available. However, this verdict to allow the image to run enabled other architectures in the ManifestList to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously been decrypted. A patch has been applied to imgcrypt 1.1.4. Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote user.\n\n- CVE-2022-33174: Power Distribution Units running on Powertek firmware (multiple brands) before 3.30.30 allows remote authorization bypass in the web interface. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must send an HTTP packet to the data retrieval interface (/cgi/get_param.cgi) with the tmpToken cookie set to an empty string followed by a semicolon. This bypasses an active session authorization check. This can be then used to fetch the values of protected sys.passwd and sys.su.name fields that contain the username and password in cleartext.\n\n- CVE-2021-22240: Improper access control in GitLab EE versions 13.11.6, 13.12.6, and 14.0.2 allows users to be created via single sign on despite user cap being enabled\n\n- CVE-2021-35112: A user with user level permission can access graphics protected region due to improper access control in register configuration in Snapdragon Auto, Snapdragon Compute, Snapdragon Connectivity, Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Voice & Music, Snapdragon Wearables\n\n- CVE-2021-37409: Improper access control for some Intel(R) PROSet/Wireless WiFi and Killer(TM) WiFi products may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.\n\n- CVE-2022-0574: Improper Access Control in GitHub repository publify/publify prior to 9.2.8.\n\n- CVE-2022-1944: When the feature is configured, improper authorization in the Interactive Web Terminal in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 11.3 prior to 14.9.5, 14.10 prior to 14.10.4, and 15.0 prior to 15.0.1 allows users with the Developer role to open terminals on other Developers' running jobs\n\n- CVE-2022-2095: An improper access control check in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions starting from 13.7 before 15.0.5, all versions starting from 15.1 before 15.1.4, all versions starting from 15.2 before 15.2.1 allows a malicious authenticated user to view a public project's Deploy Key's public fingerprint and name when that key has write permission. Note that GitLab never asks for nor stores the private key.\n\n- CVE-2022-23488: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4-rc-6 are vulnerable to Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data. The moderators-only webcams lock setting is not enforced on the backend, which allows an attacker to subscribe to viewers' webcams, even when the lock setting is applied. (The required streamId was being sent to all users even with lock setting applied). This issue is fixed in version 2.4-rc-6. There are no workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-0406: Improper Authorization in GitHub repository janeczku/calibre-web prior to 0.6.16.\n\n- CVE-2022-35921: fof/byobu is a private discussions extension for Flarum forum. Affected versions were found to not respect private discussion disablement by users. Users of Byobu should update the extension to version 1.1.7, where this has been patched. Users of Byobu with Flarum 1.0 or 1.1 should upgrade to Flarum 1.2 or later, or evaluate the impact this issue has on your forum's users and choose to disable the extension if needed. There are no workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-41923: Grails Spring Security Core plugin is vulnerable to privilege escalation. The vulnerability allows an attacker access to one endpoint (i.e. the targeted endpoint) using the authorization requirements of a different endpoint (i.e. the donor endpoint). In some Grails framework applications, access to the targeted endpoint will be granted based on meeting the authorization requirements of the donor endpoint, which can result in a privilege escalation attack. This vulnerability has been patched in grails-spring-security-core versions 3.3.2, 4.0.5 and 5.1.1. Impacted Applications: Grails Spring Security Core plugin versions: 1.x 2.x >=3.0.0 <3.3.2 >=4.0.0 <4.0.5 >=5.0.0 <5.1.1 We strongly suggest that all Grails framework applications using the Grails Spring Security Core plugin be updated to a patched release of the plugin. Workarounds: Users should create a subclass extending one of the following classes from the `grails.plugin.springsecurity.web.access.intercept` package, depending on their security configuration: * `AnnotationFilterInvocationDefinition` * `InterceptUrlMapFilterInvocationDefinition` * `RequestmapFilterInvocationDefinition` In each case, the subclass should override the `calculateUri` method like so: ``` @Override protected String calculateUri(HttpServletRequest request) { UrlPathHelper.defaultInstance.getRequestUri(request) } ``` This should be considered a temporary measure, as the patched versions of grails-spring-security-core deprecates the `calculateUri` method. Once upgraded to a patched version of the plugin, this workaround is no longer needed. The workaround is especially important for version 2.x, as no patch is available version 2.x of the GSSC plugin.\n\n- CVE-2022-0580: Incorrect Authorization in Packagist librenms/librenms prior to 22.2.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-1223: Incorrect Authorization in GitHub repository phpipam/phpipam prior to 1.4.6. \n\n- CVE-2022-0117: Policy bypass in Blink in Google Chrome prior to 97.0.4692.71 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-0334: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions.

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 23.0.7 or 24.0.3. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 22.2.11, 23.0.7 or 24.0.3. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-24783: Deno is a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. The versions of Deno between release 1.18.0 and 1.20.2 (inclusive) are vulnerable to an attack where a malicious actor controlling the code executed in a Deno runtime could bypass all permission checks and execute arbitrary shell code. This vulnerability does not affect users of Deno Deploy. The vulnerability has been patched in Deno 1.20.3. There is no workaround. All users are recommended to upgrade to 1.20.3 immediately.\n\n- CVE-2022-25318: An issue was discovered in Cerebrate through 1.4. An incorrect sharing group ACL allowed an unprivileged user to edit and modify sharing groups.\n\n- CVE-2022-27575: Information exposure vulnerability in One UI Home prior to SMR April-2022 Release 1 allows to access currently launched foreground app information without permission.\n\n- CVE-2022-35716: IBM UrbanCode Deploy (UCD) 6.2.0.0 through 6.2.7.16, 7.0.0.0 through 7.0.5.11, 7.1.0.0 through 7.1.2.7, and 7.2.0.0 through 7.2.3.0 could allow an authenticated user to obtain sensitive information in some instances due to improper security checking. IBM X-Force ID: 231360.\n\n- CVE-2022-2408: The Guest account feature in Mattermost version 6.7.0 and earlier fails to properly restrict the permissions, which allows a guest user to fetch a list of all public channels in the team, in spite of not being part of those channels.\n\n- CVE-2022-0985: Insufficient capability checks could allow users with the moodle/site:uploadusers capability to delete users, without having the necessary moodle/user:delete capability.\n\n- CVE-2022-1460: An issue has been discovered in GitLab affecting all versions starting from 9.2 before 14.8.6, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.4, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.1. GitLab was not performing correct authorizations on scheduled pipelines allowing a malicious user to run a pipeline in the context of another user.\n\n- CVE-2022-24748: Shopware is an open commerce platform based on the Symfony php Framework and the Vue javascript framework. In versions prior to 6.4.8.2 it is possible to modify customers and to create orders without App Permission. This issue is a result of improper api route checking. Users are advised to upgrade to version 6.4.8.2. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-25335: RigoBlock Dragos through 2022-02-17 lacks the onlyOwner modifier for setMultipleAllowances. This enables token manipulation, as exploited in the wild in February 2022. NOTE: although 2022-02-17 is the vendor's vulnerability announcement date, the vulnerability will not be remediated until a major protocol upgrade occurs.\n\n- CVE-2022-36103: Talos Linux is a Linux distribution built for Kubernetes deployments. Talos worker nodes use a join token to get accepted into the Talos cluster. Due to improper validation of the request while signing a worker node CSR (certificate signing request) Talos control plane node might issue Talos API certificate which allows full access to Talos API on a control plane node. Accessing Talos API with full level access on a control plane node might reveal sensitive information which allows full level access to the cluster (Kubernetes and Talos PKI, etc.). Talos API join token is stored in the machine configuration on the worker node. When configured correctly, Kubernetes workloads don't have access to the machine configuration, but due to a misconfiguration workload might access the machine configuration and reveal the join token. This problem has been fixed in Talos 1.2.2. Enabling the Pod Security Standards mitigates the vulnerability by denying hostPath mounts and host networking by default in the baseline policy. Clusters that don't run untrusted workloads are not affected. Clusters with correct Pod Security configurations which don't allow hostPath mounts, and secure access to cloud metadata server (or machine configuration is not supplied via cloud metadata server) are not affected.\n\n- CVE-2022-46792: Hasura GraphQL Engine before 2.15.2 mishandles row-level authorization in the Update Many API for Postgres backends. The fixed versions are 2.10.2, 2.11.3, 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.1, and 2.15.2. (Versions before 2.10.0 are unaffected.)\n\n- CVE-2022-3048: Inappropriate implementation in Chrome OS lockscreen in Google Chrome on Chrome OS prior to 105.0.5195.52 allowed a local attacker to bypass lockscreen navigation restrictions via physical access to the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-30538: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-30539: Insufficient policy enforcement in content security policy in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-31876: Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 through 0.21.1 does not properly implement the replacement policy specified in BIP125, which makes it easier for attackers to trigger a loss of funds, or a denial of service attack against downstream projects such as Lightning network nodes. An unconfirmed child transaction with nSequence = 0xff_ff_ff_ff, spending an unconfirmed parent with nSequence <= 0xff_ff_ff_fd, should be replaceable because there is inherited signaling by the child transaction. However, the actual PreChecks implementation does not enforce this. Instead, mempool rejects the replacement attempt of the unconfirmed child transaction.\n\n- CVE-2021-3763: A flaw was found in the Red Hat AMQ Broker management console in version 7.8 where an existing user is able to access some limited information even when the role the user is assigned to should not be allow access to the management console. The main impact is to confidentiality as this flaw means some role bindings are incorrectly checked, some privileged meta information such as queue names and configuration details are disclosed but the impact is limited as not all information is accessible and there is no affect to integrity.\n\n- CVE-2021-39206: Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, contains two authorization related vulnerabilities CVE-2021-32777 and CVE-2021-32779. This may lead to incorrect routing or authorization policy decisions. With specially crafted requests, incorrect authorization or routing decisions may be made by Pomerium. Pomerium v0.14.8 and v0.15.1 contain an upgraded envoy binary with these vulnerabilities patched. This issue can only be triggered when using path prefix based policy. Removing any such policies should provide mitigation.\n\n- CVE-2022-0333: A flaw was found in Moodle in versions 3.11 to 3.11.4, 3.10 to 3.10.8, 3.9 to 3.9.11 and earlier unsupported versions. The calendar:manageentries capability allowed managers to access or modify any calendar event, but should have been restricted from accessing user level events.\n\n- CVE-2022-0633: The UpdraftPlus WordPress plugin Free before 1.22.3 and Premium before 2.22.3 do not properly validate a user has the required privileges to access a backup's nonce identifier, which may allow any users with an account on the site (such as subscriber) to download the most recent site & database backup.\n\n- CVE-2022-0740: Incorrect authorization in the Asana integration's branch restriction feature in all versions of GitLab CE/EE starting from version 7.8.0 before 14.7.7, all versions starting from 14.8 before 14.8.5, all versions starting from 14.9 before 14.9.2 makes it possible to close Asana tasks from unrestricted branches.\n\n- CVE-2022-0825: The Amelia WordPress plugin before 1.0.49 does not have proper authorisation when managing appointments, allowing any customer to update other's booking status, as well as retrieve sensitive information about the bookings, such as the full name and phone number of the person who booked it.\n\n- CVE-2022-1935: Incorrect authorization in GitLab EE affecting all versions from 12.0 before 14.9.5, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.4, all versions starting from 15.0 before 15.0.1 allowed an attacker already in possession of a valid Project Trigger Token to misuse it from any location even when IP address restrictions were configured\n\n- CVE-2022-1936: Incorrect authorization in GitLab EE affecting all versions from 12.0 before 14.9.5, all versions starting from 14.10 before 14.10.4, all versions starting from 15.0 before 15.0.1 allowed an attacker already in possession of a valid Project Deploy Token to misuse it from any location even when IP address restrictions were configured\n\n- CVE-2022-1981: An issue has been discovered in GitLab EE affecting all versions starting from 12.2 prior to 14.10.5, 15.0 prior to 15.0.4, and 15.1 prior to 15.1.1. In GitLab, if a group enables the setting to restrict access to users belonging to specific domains, that allow-list may be bypassed if a Maintainer uses the 'Invite a group' feature to invite a group that has members that don't comply with domain allow-list.\n\n- CVE-2022-21701: Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. In versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 Istio is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack. Users who have `CREATE` permission for `gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` objects can escalate this privilege to create other resources that they may not have access to, such as `Pod`. This vulnerability impacts only an Alpha level feature, the Kubernetes Gateway API. This is not the same as the Istio Gateway type (gateways.networking.istio.io), which is not vulnerable. Users are advised to upgrade to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade should implement any of the following which will prevent this vulnerability: Remove the gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io CustomResourceDefinition, set PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER=true environment variable in Istiod, or remove CREATE permissions for gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io objects from untrusted users.\n\n- CVE-2022-22326: IBM Datapower Gateway 10.0.2.0 through 10.0.4.0, 10.0.1.0 through 10.0.1.5, and 2018.4.1.0 through 2018.4.1.18 could allow unauthorized viewing of logs and files due to insufficient authorization checks. IBM X-Force ID: 218856.\n\n- CVE-2022-23490: BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4.0 expose sensitive information to Unauthorized Actors. This issue affects meetings with polls, where the attacker is a meeting participant. Subscribing to the current-poll collection does not update the client UI, but does give the attacker access to the contents of the collection, which include the individual poll responses. This issue is patched in version 2.4.0. There are no workarounds. \n\n- CVE-2022-23615: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions any user with SCRIPT right can save a document with the right of the current user which allow accessing API requiring programming right if the current user has programming right. This has been patched in XWiki 13.0. Users are advised to update to resolve this issue. The only known workaround is to limit SCRIPT access.\n\n- CVE-2022-23627: ArchiSteamFarm (ASF) is a C# application with primary purpose of idling Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug in ASF code, introduced in version V5.2.2.2, the program didn't adequately verify effective access of the user sending proxy (i.e. `[Bots]`) commands. In particular, a proxy-like command sent to bot `A` targeting bot `B` has incorrectly verified user's access against bot `A` - instead of bot `B`, to which the command was originally designated. This in result allowed access to resources beyond those configured, being a security threat affecting confidentiality of other bot instances. A successful attack exploiting this bug requires a significant access granted explicitly by original owner of the ASF process prior to that, as attacker has to control at least a single bot in the process to make use of this inadequate access verification loophole. The issue is patched in ASF V5.2.2.5, V5.2.3.2 and future versions. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.\n\n- CVE-2022-23739: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server, allowing for escalation of privileges in GraphQL API requests from GitHub Apps. This vulnerability allowed an app installed on an organization to gain access to and modify most organization-level resources that are not tied to a repository regardless of granted permissions, such as users and organization-wide projects. Resources associated with repositories were not impacted, such as repository file content, repository-specific projects, issues, or pull requests. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.7.1 and was fixed in versions 3.3.16, 3.4.11, 3.5.8, 3.6.4, 3.7.1. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.\n\n- CVE-2022-23741: An incorrect authorization vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed a scoped user-to-server token to escalate to full admin/owner privileges. An attacker would require an account with admin access to install a malicious GitHub App. This vulnerability was fixed in versions 3.3.17, 3.4.12, 3.5.9, and 3.6.5. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.\n\n- CVE-2022-24307: Mastodon before 3.3.2 and 3.4.x before 3.4.6 has incorrect access control because it does not compact incoming signed JSON-LD activities. (JSON-LD signing has been supported since version 1.6.0.)\n\n- CVE-2022-24714: Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework and command-line interface. Installations of Icinga 2 with the IDO writer enabled are affected. If you use service custom variables in role restrictions, and you regularly decommission service objects, users with said roles may still have access to a collection of content. Note that this only applies if a role has implicitly permitted access to hosts, due to permitted access to at least one of their services. If access to a host is permitted by other means, no sensible information has been disclosed to unauthorized users. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2.\n\n- CVE-2022-24721: CometD is a scalable comet implementation for web messaging. In any version prior to 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6, internal usage of Oort and Seti channels is improperly authorized, so any remote user could subscribe and publish to those channels. By subscribing to those channels, a remote user may be able to watch cluster-internal traffic that contains other users' (possibly sensitive) data. By publishing to those channels, a remote user may be able to create/modify/delete other user's data and modify the cluster structure. A fix is available in versions 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6. As a workaround, install a custom `SecurityPolicy` that forbids subscription and publishing to remote, non-Oort, sessions on Oort and Seti channels.\n\n- CVE-2022-2597: The Visual Portfolio, Photo Gallery & Post Grid WordPress plugin before 2.19.0 does not have proper authorisation checks in some of its REST endpoints, allowing users with a role as low as contributor to call them and inject arbitrary CSS in arbitrary saved layouts\n\n- CVE-2022-26767: The issue was addressed with additional permissions checks. This issue is fixed in macOS Monterey 12.4, macOS Big Sur 11.6.6.

This could result in a user disabling anti-tampering mechanisms which would then allow the user to disable Forcepoint One Endpoint and the protection offered by it.\n\n- CVE-2022-27609: Forcepoint One Endpoint prior to version 22.01 installed on Microsoft Windows does not provide sufficient anti-tampering protection of services by users with Administrator privileges. This could result in a user disabling Forcepoint One Endpoint and the protection offered by it.\n\n- CVE-2022-27668: Depending on the configuration of the route permission table in file 'saprouttab', it is possible for an unauthenticated attacker to execute SAProuter administration commands in SAP NetWeaver and ABAP Platform - versions KERNEL 7.49, 7.77, 7.81, 7.85, 7.86, 7.87, 7.88, KRNL64NUC 7.49, KRNL64UC 7.49, SAP_ROUTER 7.53, 7.22, from a remote client, for example stopping the SAProuter, that could highly impact systems availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-31039: Greenlight is a simple front-end interface for your BigBlueButton server. In affected versions an attacker can view any room's settings even though they are not authorized to do so. Only the room owner and administrator should be able to view a room's settings. This issue has been patched in release version 2.12.6.\n\n- CVE-2022-31107: Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In versions 5.3 until 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10, it is possible for a malicious user who has authorization to log into a Grafana instance via a configured OAuth IdP which provides a login name to take over the account of another user in that Grafana instance. This can occur when the malicious user is authorized to log in to Grafana via OAuth, the malicious user's external user id is not already associated with an account in Grafana, the malicious user's email address is not already associated with an account in Grafana, and the malicious user knows the Grafana username of the target user. If these conditions are met, the malicious user can set their username in the OAuth provider to that of the target user, then go through the OAuth flow to log in to Grafana. Due to the way that external and internal user accounts are linked together during login, if the conditions above are all met then the malicious user will be able to log in to the target user's Grafana account. Versions 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, concerned users can disable OAuth login to their Grafana instance, or ensure that all users authorized to log in via OAuth have a corresponding user account in Grafana linked to their email address.\n\n- CVE-2022-31155: Sourcegraph is an opensource code search and navigation engine. In Sourcegraph versions before 3.41.0, it is possible for an attacker to delete other users\u2019 saved searches due to a bug in the authorization check. The vulnerability does not allow the reading of other users\u2019 saved searches, only overwriting them with attacker-controlled searches. The issue is patched in Sourcegraph version 3.41.0. There is no workaround for this issue and updating to a secure version is highly recommended.\n\n- CVE-2022-31168: Zulip is an open source team chat tool. Due to an incorrect authorization check in Zulip Server 5.4 and earlier, a member of an organization could craft an API call that grants organization administrator privileges to one of their bots. The vulnerability is fixed in Zulip Server 5.5. Members who don\u2019t own any bots, and lack permission to create them, can\u2019t exploit the vulnerability. As a workaround for the vulnerability, an organization administrator can restrict the `Who can create bots` permission to administrators only, and change the ownership of existing bots.\n\n- CVE-2022-39214: Combodo iTop is an open source, web-based IT service management platform. Prior to versions 2.7.8 and 3.0.2-1, a user who can log in on iTop is able to take over any account just by knowing the account's username. This issue is fixed in versions 2.7.8 and 3.0.2-1.\n\n- CVE-2022-39302: Ree6 is a moderation bot. This vulnerability would allow other server owners to create configurations such as \"Better-Audit-Logging\" which contain a channel from another server as a target. This would mean you could send log messages to another Guild channel and bypass raid and webhook protections. A specifically crafted log message could allow spamming and mass advertisements. This issue has been patched in version 1.9.9. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-39322: @keystone-6/core is a core package for Keystone 6, a content management system for Node.js.

In affected versions of Redis an integer overflow bug in 32-bit Redis version 4.0 or newer could be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. Redis 4.0 or newer uses a configurable limit for the maximum supported bulk input size. By default, it is 512MB which is a safe value for all platforms. If the limit is significantly increased, receiving a large request from a client may trigger several integer overflow scenarios, which would result with buffer overflow and heap corruption. We believe this could in certain conditions be exploited for remote code execution. By default, authenticated Redis users have access to all configuration parameters and can therefore use the \u201cCONFIG SET proto-max-bulk-len\u201d to change the safe default, making the system vulnerable. **This problem only affects 32-bit Redis (on a 32-bit system, or as a 32-bit executable running on a 64-bit system).** The problem is fixed in version 6.2, and the fix is back ported to 6.0.11 and 5.0.11. Make sure you use one of these versions if you are running 32-bit Redis. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent clients from directly executing `CONFIG SET`: Using Redis 6.0 or newer, ACL configuration can be used to block the command. Using older versions, the `rename-command` configuration directive can be used to rename the command to a random string unknown to users, rendering it inaccessible. Please note that this workaround may have an additional impact on users or operational systems that expect `CONFIG SET` to behave in certain ways.\n\n- CVE-2021-21807: An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the DICOM parse_dicom_meta_info functionality of Accusoft ImageGear 19.9.

An integer overflow bug in Redis version 6.0 or newer, could be exploited using the STRALGO LCS command to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. This is a result of an incomplete fix by CVE-2021-29477. The problem is fixed in version 6.2.4 and 6.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to use ACL configuration to prevent clients from using the STRALGO LCS command. On 64 bit systems which have the fixes of CVE-2021-29477 (6.2.3 or 6.0.13), it is sufficient to make sure that the proto-max-bulk-len config parameter is smaller than 2GB (default is 512MB).\n\n- CVE-2021-32628: Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. An integer overflow bug in the ziplist data structure used by all versions of Redis can be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution.

The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16, 5.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from modifying the above configuration parameters. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.\n\n- CVE-2021-34385: Trusty TLK contains a vulnerability in the NVIDIA TLK kernel where an integer overflow in the calculation of a length could lead to a heap overflow.\n\n- CVE-2021-34386: Trusty TLK contains a vulnerability in the NVIDIA TLK kernel where an integer overflow in the calloc size calculation can cause the multiplication of count and size can overflow, which might lead to heap overflows.\n\n- CVE-2021-39254: A crafted NTFS image can cause an integer overflow in memmove, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow in the function ntfs_attr_record_resize, in NTFS-3G < 2021.8.22.\n\n- CVE-2021-40346: An integer overflow exists in HAProxy 2.0 through 2.5 in htx_add_header that can be exploited to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack, allowing an attacker to bypass all configured http-request HAProxy ACLs and possibly other ACLs.\n\n- CVE-2021-41864: prealloc_elems_and_freelist in kernel/bpf/stackmap.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.12 allows unprivileged users to trigger an eBPF multiplication integer overflow with a resultant out-of-bounds write.\n\n- CVE-2021-41991: The in-memory certificate cache in strongSwan before 5.9.4 has a remote integer overflow upon receiving many requests with different certificates to fill the cache and later trigger the replacement of cache entries. The code attempts to select a less-often-used cache entry by means of a random number generator, but this is not done correctly. Remote code execution might be a slight possibility.\n\n- CVE-2021-43784: runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. In runc, netlink is used internally as a serialization system for specifying the relevant container configuration to the `C` portion of the code (responsible for the based namespace setup of containers). In all versions of runc prior to 1.0.3, the encoder did not handle the possibility of an integer overflow in the 16-bit length field for the byte array attribute type, meaning that a large enough malicious byte array attribute could result in the length overflowing and the attribute contents being parsed as netlink messages for container configuration. This vulnerability requires the attacker to have some control over the configuration of the container and would allow the attacker to bypass the namespace restrictions of the container by simply adding their own netlink payload which disables all namespaces. The main users impacted are those who allow untrusted images with untrusted configurations to run on their machines (such as with shared cloud infrastructure). runc version 1.0.3 contains a fix for this bug. As a workaround, one may try disallowing untrusted namespace paths from your container. It should be noted that untrusted namespace paths would allow the attacker to disable namespace protections entirely even in the absence of this bug.\n\n- CVE-2021-36155: LengthPrefixedMessageReader in gRPC Swift 1.1.0 and earlier allocates buffers of arbitrary length, which allows remote attackers to cause uncontrolled resource consumption and deny service.\n\n- CVE-2020-28009: Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow because get_stdinput allows unbounded reads that are accompanied by unbounded increases in a certain size variable.

With the reference count overflowing, a use-after-free can be constructed on the wl_shm_pool tracking structure, where values may be incremented or decremented; it may also be possible to construct a limited oracle to leak 4 bytes of server-side memory to the attacking client at a time.\n\n- CVE-2021-39762: In tremolo, there is a possible out of bounds read due to an integer overflow. This could lead to remote information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-12LAndroid ID: A-210625816\n\n- CVE-2021-40417: When parsing a file that is submitted to the DPDecoder service as a job, the service will use the combination of decoding parameters that were submitted with the job along with fields that were parsed for the submitted video by the R3D SDK to calculate the size of a heap buffer. Due to an integer overflow with regards to this calculation, this can result in an undersized heap buffer being allocated. When this heap buffer is written to, a heap-based buffer overflow will occur. This can result in code execution under the context of the application.\n\n- CVE-2021-4206: A flaw was found in the QXL display device emulation in QEMU. An integer overflow in the cursor_alloc() function can lead to the allocation of a small cursor object followed by a subsequent heap-based buffer overflow. This flaw allows a malicious privileged guest user to crash the QEMU process on the host or potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process.\n\n- CVE-2021-46829: GNOME GdkPixbuf (aka GDK-PixBuf) before 2.42.8 allows a heap-based buffer overflow when compositing or clearing frames in GIF files, as demonstrated by io-gif-animation.c composite_frame. This overflow is controllable and could be abused for code execution, especially on 32-bit systems.\n\n- CVE-2022-0204: A heap overflow vulnerability was found in bluez in versions prior to 5.63.

Integer overflow in matroskademux element in gst_matroska_decompress_data function which causes a segfault, or could cause a heap overwrite, depending on libc and OS. Depending on the libc used, and the underlying OS capabilities, it could be just a segfault or a heap overwrite. If the libc uses mmap for large chunks, and the OS supports mmap, then it is just a segfault (because the realloc before the integer overflow will use mremap to reduce the size of the chunk, and it will start to write to unmapped memory). However, if using a libc implementation that does not use mmap, or if the OS does not support mmap while using libc, then this could result in a heap overwrite.\n\n- CVE-2022-1923: DOS / potential heap overwrite in mkv demuxing using bzip decompression. Integer overflow in matroskademux element in bzip decompression function which causes a segfault, or could cause a heap overwrite, depending on libc and OS. Depending on the libc used, and the underlying OS capabilities, it could be just a segfault or a heap overwrite. If the libc uses mmap for large chunks, and the OS supports mmap, then it is just a segfault (because the realloc before the integer overflow will use mremap to reduce the size of the chunk, and it will start to write to unmapped memory). However, if using a libc implementation that does not use mmap, or if the OS does not support mmap while using libc, then this could result in a heap overwrite.\n\n- CVE-2022-1924: DOS / potential heap overwrite in mkv demuxing using lzo decompression. Integer overflow in matroskademux element in lzo decompression function which causes a segfault, or could cause a heap overwrite, depending on libc and OS. Depending on the libc used, and the underlying OS capabilities, it could be just a segfault or a heap overwrite. If the libc uses mmap for large chunks, and the OS supports mmap, then it is just a segfault (because the realloc before the integer overflow will use mremap to reduce the size of the chunk, and it will start to write to unmapped memory). However, if using a libc implementation that does not use mmap, or if the OS does not support mmap while using libc, then this could result in a heap overwrite.\n\n- CVE-2022-1925: DOS / potential heap overwrite in mkv demuxing using HEADERSTRIP decompression.

An attacker can craft a TFLite model that would cause an integer overflow in embedding lookup operations. Both `embedding_size` and `lookup_size` are products of values provided by the user. Hence, a malicious user could trigger overflows in the multiplication. In certain scenarios, this can then result in heap OOB read/write. Users are advised to upgrade to a patched version.\n\n- CVE-2022-24310: A CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound vulnerability exists that could cause heap-based buffer overflow, leading to denial of service and potentially remote code execution when an attacker sends multiple specially crafted messages. Affected Product: Interactive Graphical SCADA System Data Server (V15.0.0.22020 and prior)\n\n- CVE-2022-24724: cmark-gfm is GitHub's extended version of the C reference implementation of CommonMark. Prior to versions 0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21, an integer overflow in cmark-gfm's table row parsing `table.c:row_from_string` may lead to heap memory corruption when parsing tables who's marker rows contain more than UINT16_MAX columns. The impact of this heap corruption ranges from Information Leak to Arbitrary Code Execution depending on how and where `cmark-gfm` is used. If `cmark-gfm` is used for rendering remote user controlled markdown, this vulnerability may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in applications employing affected versions of the `cmark-gfm` library. This vulnerability has been patched in the following cmark-gfm versions 0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21. A workaround is available. The vulnerability exists in the table markdown extensions of cmark-gfm. Disabling the table extension will prevent this vulnerability from being triggered.\n\n- CVE-2022-24795: yajl-ruby is a C binding to the YAJL JSON parsing and generation library. The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an integer overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing with large (~2GB) inputs. The reallocation logic at `yajl_buf.c#L64` may result in the `need` 32bit integer wrapping to 0 when `need` approaches a value of 0x80000000 (i.e. ~2GB of data), which results in a reallocation of buf->alloc into a small heap chunk. These integers are declared as `size_t` in the 2.x branch of `yajl`, which practically prevents the issue from triggering on 64bit platforms, however this does not preclude this issue triggering on 32bit builds on which `size_t` is a 32bit integer. Subsequent population of this under-allocated heap chunk is based on the original buffer size, leading to heap memory corruption. This vulnerability mostly impacts process availability. Maintainers believe exploitation for arbitrary code execution is unlikely. A patch is available and anticipated to be part of yajl-ruby version 1.4.2. As a workaround, avoid passing large inputs to YAJL.\n\n- CVE-2022-25291: An integer overflow in WatchGuard Firebox and XTM appliances allows an authenticated remote attacker to trigger a heap-based buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code by initiating a firmware update with a malicious upgrade image.

The size calculation in `build_open_gop_key_points()` goes through all entries in the loop and adds `sc->ctts_data[i].count` to `sc->sample_offsets_count`. This can lead to an integer overflow resulting in a small allocation with `av_calloc()`. An attacker can cause remote code execution via a malicious mp4 file. We recommend upgrading past commit c953baa084607dd1d84c3bfcce3cf6a87c3e6e05\n\n- CVE-2022-26459: In vow, there is a possible out of bounds read due to an integer overflow.

Versions 7.0.0 and above, prior to 7.0.5 are vulnerable to an Integer Overflow. Executing an `XAUTOCLAIM` command on a stream key in a specific state, with a specially crafted `COUNT` argument may cause an integer overflow, a subsequent heap overflow, and potentially lead to remote code execution. This has been patched in Redis version 7.0.5. No known workarounds exist.\n\n- CVE-2022-39343: Azure RTOS FileX is a FAT-compatible file system that\u2019s fully integrated with Azure RTOS ThreadX. In versions before 6.2.0, the Fault Tolerant feature of Azure RTOS FileX includes integer under and overflows which may be exploited to achieve buffer overflow and modify memory contents. When a valid log file with correct ID and checksum is detected by the `_fx_fault_tolerant_enable` function an attempt to recover the previous failed write operation is taken by call of `_fx_fault_tolerant_apply_logs`. This function iterates through the log entries and performs required recovery operations. When properly crafted a log including entries of type `FX_FAULT_TOLERANT_DIR_LOG_TYPE` may be utilized to introduce unexpected behavior. This issue has been patched in version 6.2.0. A workaround to fix line 218 in fx_fault_tolerant_apply_logs.c is documented in the GHSA.\n\n- CVE-2022-41318: A buffer over-read was discovered in libntlmauth in Squid 2.5 through 5.6.

Due to a bug in ASF code `POST /Api/ASF` ASF API endpoint responsible for updating global ASF config incorrectly removed `IPCPassword` from the resulting config when the caller did not specify it explicitly. Due to the above, it was possible for the user to accidentally remove `IPCPassword` security measure from his IPC interface when updating global ASF config, which exists as part of global config update functionality in ASF-ui. Removal of `IPCPassword` possesses a security risk, as unauthorized users may in result access the IPC interface after such modification. The issue is patched in ASF V5.1.2.4 and future versions. We recommend to manually verify that `IPCPassword` is specified after update, and if not, set it accordingly. In default settings, ASF is configured to allow IPC access from `localhost` only and should not affect majority of users.\n\n- CVE-2021-3282: HashiCorp Vault Enterprise 1.6.0 & 1.6.1 allowed the `remove-peer` raft operator command to be executed against DR secondaries without authentication.

Prior to version 1.10.7, FreeSWITCH does not authenticate SIP MESSAGE requests, leading to spam and message spoofing. By default, SIP requests of the type MESSAGE (RFC 3428) are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. MESSAGE requests are relayed to SIP user agents registered with the FreeSWITCH server without requiring any authentication. Although this behaviour can be changed by setting the `auth-messages` parameter to `true`, it is not the default setting. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to send SIP MESSAGE messages to any SIP user agent that is registered with the server without requiring authentication. Additionally, since no authentication is required, chat messages can be spoofed to appear to come from trusted entities. Therefore, abuse can lead to spam and enable social engineering, phishing and similar attacks. This issue is patched in version 1.10.7. Maintainers recommend that this SIP message type is authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to be explicitly set the `auth-messages` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-38412: Properly formatted POST requests to multiple resources on the HTTP and HTTPS web servers of the Digi PortServer TS 16 Rack device do not require authentication or authentication tokens.

By default, SIP requests of the type SUBSCRIBE are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to subscribe to user agent event notifications without the need to authenticate. This abuse poses privacy concerns and might lead to social engineering or similar attacks. For example, attackers may be able to monitor the status of target SIP extensions. Although this issue was fixed in version v1.10.6, installations upgraded to the fixed version of FreeSWITCH from an older version, may still be vulnerable if the configuration is not updated accordingly. Software upgrades do not update the configuration by default. SIP SUBSCRIBE messages should be authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to explicitly set the `auth-subscriptions` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.\n\n- CVE-2020-25566: In SapphireIMS 5.0, it is possible to take over an account by sending a request to the Save_Password form as shown in POC.

This often exists in Linux-based code assuming the controlled nature of the root directory (/) or its subdirectories (/etc, etc), or a code that recursively accesses the parent directory. In Windows, the drive root and some of its subdirectories have weak permissions by default, which makes them uncontrolled.\n\n\nIn some Unix-based systems, a PATH might be created that contains an empty element, e.g. by splicing an empty variable into the PATH. This empty element can be interpreted as equivalent to the current working directory, which might be an untrusted search element.\n\n\nIn software package management frameworks (e.g., npm, RubyGems, or PyPi), the framework may identify dependencies on third-party libraries or other packages, then consult a repository that contains the desired package. The framework may search a public repository before a private repository. This could be exploited by attackers by placing a malicious package in the public repository that has the same name as a package from the private repository. The search path might not be directly under control of the developer relying on the framework, but this search order effectively contains an untrusted element.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2023-25815: chain: a change in an underlying package causes the gettext function to use implicit initialization with a hard-coded path (CWE-1419) under the user-writable C:\\ drive, introducing an untrusted search path element (CWE-427) that enables spoofing of messages.\n\n- CVE-2022-4826: Go-based git extension on Windows can search for and execute a malicious \"..exe\" in a repository because Go searches the current working directory if git.exe is not found in the PATH\n\n- CVE-2020-26284: A Static Site Generator built in Go, when running on Windows, searches the current working directory for a command, possibly allowing code execution using a malicious .exe or .bat file with the name being searched\n\n- CVE-2022-24765: Windows-based fork of git creates a \".git\" folder in the C: drive, allowing local attackers to create a .git folder with a malicious config file\n\n- CVE-2019-1552: SSL package searches under \"C:/usr/local\" for configuration files and other critical data, but C:/usr/local might be world-writable.\n\n- CVE-2010-3402: \"DLL hijacking\" issue in document editor.\n\n- CVE-2010-3397: \"DLL hijacking\" issue in encryption software.\n\n- CVE-2010-3138: \"DLL hijacking\" issue in library used by multiple media players.\n\n- CVE-2010-3152: \"DLL hijacking\" issue in illustration program.\n\n- CVE-2010-3147: \"DLL hijacking\" issue in address book.\n\n- CVE-2010-3135: \"DLL hijacking\" issue in network monitoring software.\n\n- CVE-2010-3131: \"DLL hijacking\" issue in web browser.\n\n- CVE-2010-1795: \"DLL hijacking\" issue in music player/organizer.\n\n- CVE-2002-1576: Product uses the current working directory to find and execute a program, which allows local users to gain privileges by creating a symlink that points to a malicious version of the program.\n\n- CVE-1999-1461: Product trusts the PATH environmental variable to find and execute a program, which allows local users to obtain root access by modifying the PATH to point to a malicous version of that program.\n\n- CVE-1999-1318: Software uses a search path that includes the current working directory (.), which allows local users to gain privileges via malicious programs.\n\n- CVE-2003-0579: Admin software trusts the user-supplied -uv.install command line option to find and execute the uv.install program, which allows local users to gain privileges by providing a pathname that is under control of the user.\n\n- CVE-2000-0854: When a document is opened, the directory of that document is first used to locate DLLs , which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands by inserting malicious DLLs into the same directory as the document.\n\n- CVE-2001-0943: Database trusts the PATH environment variable to find and execute programs, which allows local users to modify the PATH to point to malicious programs.\n\n- CVE-2001-0942: Database uses an environment variable to find and execute a program, which allows local users to execute arbitrary programs by changing the environment variable.\n\n- CVE-2001-0507: Server uses relative paths to find system files that will run in-process, which allows local users to gain privileges via a malicious file.\n\n- CVE-2002-2017: Product allows local users to execute arbitrary code by setting an environment variable to reference a malicious program.\n\n- CVE-1999-0690: Product includes the current directory in root's PATH variable.\n\n- CVE-2001-0912: Error during packaging causes product to include a hard-coded, non-standard directory in search path.\n\n- CVE-2001-0289: Product searches current working directory for configuration file.\n\n- CVE-2005-1705: Product searches current working directory for configuration file.\n\n- CVE-2005-1307: Product executable other program from current working directory.\n\n- CVE-2002-2040: Untrusted path.\n\n- CVE-2005-2072: Modification of trusted environment variable leads to untrusted path vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2005-1632: Product searches /tmp for modules before other paths.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-3115: Go before 1.14.14 and 1.15.x before 1.15.7 on Windows is vulnerable to Command Injection and remote code execution when using the \"go get\" command to fetch modules that make use of cgo (for example, cgo can execute a gcc program from an untrusted download).\n\n- CVE-2021-37617: The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud Server with a computer. The Nextcloud Desktop Client invokes its uninstaller script when being installed to make sure there are no remnants of previous installations. In versions 3.0.3 through 3.2.4, the Client searches the `Uninstall.exe` file in a folder that can be written by regular users. This could lead to a case where a malicious user creates a malicious `Uninstall.exe`, which would be executed with administrative privileges on the Nextcloud Desktop Client installation. This issue is fixed in Nextcloud Desktop Client version 3.3.0. As a workaround, do not allow untrusted users to create content in the `C:\\\\` system folder and verify that there is no malicious `C:\\\\Uninstall.exe` file on the system.\n\n- CVE-2021-1366: A vulnerability in the interprocess communication (IPC) channel of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a DLL hijacking attack on an affected device if the VPN Posture (HostScan) Module is installed on the AnyConnect client. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of resources that are loaded by the application at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPC message to the AnyConnect process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected machine with SYSTEM privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs valid credentials on the Windows system.\n\n- CVE-2021-1567: A vulnerability in the DLL loading mechanism of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a DLL hijacking attack on an affected device if the VPN Posture (HostScan) Module is installed on the AnyConnect client. This vulnerability is due to a race condition in the signature verification process for DLL files that are loaded on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted interprocess communication (IPC) messages to the AnyConnect process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with SYSTEM privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials on the Windows system.\n\n- CVE-2021-22000: VMware Thinapp version 5.x prior to 5.2.10 contain a DLL hijacking vulnerability due to insecure loading of DLLs. A malicious actor with non-administrative privileges may exploit this vulnerability to elevate privileges to administrator level on the Windows operating system having VMware ThinApp installed on it.\n\n- CVE-2021-31853: DLL Search Order Hijacking Vulnerability in McAfee Drive Encryption (MDE) prior to 7.3.0 HF2 (7.3.0.183) allows local users to execute arbitrary code and escalate privileges via execution from a compromised folder.\n\n- CVE-2021-3633: A DLL preloading vulnerability was reported in Lenovo Driver Management prior to version 2.9.0719.1104 that could allow privilege escalation.\n\n- CVE-2021-20616: Untrusted search path vulnerability in the installer of SKYSEA Client View Ver.1.020.05b to Ver.16.001.01g allows an attacker to gain privileges via a Trojan horse DLL in an unspecified directory.\n\n- CVE-2021-20674: Untrusted search path vulnerability in Installer of MagicConnect Client program distributed before 2021 March 1 allows an attacker to gain privileges and via a Trojan horse DLL in an unspecified directory and to execute arbitrary code with the privilege of the user invoking the installer when a terminal is connected remotely using Remote desktop.\n\n- CVE-2021-20722: Untrusted search path vulnerability in the installers of ScanSnap Manager prior to versions V7.0L20 and the Software Download Installer prior to WinSSInst2JP.exe and WinSSInst2iX1500JP.exe allows an attacker to gain privileges and execute arbitrary code with the privilege of the user invoking the installer via a Trojan horse DLL in an unspecified directory.\n\n- CVE-2021-20726: Untrusted search path vulnerability in The Installer of Overwolf 2.168.0.n and earlier allows an attacker to gain privileges and execute arbitrary code with the privilege of the user invoking the installer via a Trojan horse DLL in an unspecified directory.\n\n- CVE-2021-20793: Untrusted search path vulnerability in the installer of Sony Audio USB Driver V1.10 and prior and the installer of HAP Music Transfer Ver.1.3.0 and prior allows an attacker to gain privileges and execute arbitrary code via a Trojan horse DLL in an unspecified directory.\n\n- CVE-2021-36770: Encode.pm, as distributed in Perl through 5.34.0, allows local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse Encode::ConfigLocal library (in the current working directory) that preempts dynamic module loading. Exploitation requires an unusual configuration, and certain 2021 versions of Encode.pm (3.05 through 3.11). This issue occurs because the || operator evaluates @INC in a scalar context, and thus @INC has only an integer value.\n\n- CVE-2021-40981: ASUS ROG Armoury Crate Lite before 4.2.10 allows local users to gain privileges by placing a Trojan horse file in the publicly writable %PROGRAMDATA%\\\\ASUS\\\\GamingCenterLib directory.\n\n- CVE-2021-28954: In Chris Walz bit before 1.0.5 on Windows, attackers can run arbitrary code via a .exe file in a crafted repository.\n\n- CVE-2021-22195: Client side code execution in gitlab-vscode-extension v3.15.0 and earlier allows attacker to execute code on user system\n\n- CVE-2021-21999: VMware Tools for Windows (11.x.y prior to 11.2.6), VMware Remote Console for Windows (12.x prior to 12.0.1) , VMware App Volumes (2.x prior to 2.18.10 and 4 prior to 2103) contain a local privilege escalation vulnerability. An attacker with normal access to a virtual machine may exploit this issue by placing a malicious file renamed as `openssl.cnf' in an unrestricted directory which would allow code to be executed with elevated privileges.\n\n- CVE-2020-25238: A vulnerability has been identified in PCS neo (Administration Console) (All versions < V3.1), TIA Portal (V15, V15.1 and V16). Manipulating certain files in specific folders could allow a local attacker to execute code with SYSTEM privileges. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with a valid account and limited access rights on the system.\n\n- CVE-2020-15663: If Firefox is installed to a user-writable directory, the Mozilla Maintenance Service would execute updater.exe from the install location with system privileges. Although the Mozilla Maintenance Service does ensure that updater.exe is signed by Mozilla, the version could have been rolled back to a previous version which would have allowed exploitation of an older bug and arbitrary code execution with System Privileges. *Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 80, Thunderbird < 78.2, Thunderbird < 68.12, Firefox ESR < 68.12, and Firefox ESR < 78.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-33436: NoMachine for Windows prior to version 6.15.1 and 7.5.2 suffer from local privilege escalation due to the lack of safe DLL loading. This vulnerability allows local non-privileged users to perform DLL Hijacking via any writable directory listed under the system path and ultimately execute code as NT AUTHORITY\\\\SYSTEM.\n\n- CVE-2021-45975: In ListCheck.exe in Acer Care Center 4.x before 4.00.3038, a vulnerability in the loading mechanism of Windows DLLs could allow a local attacker to perform a DLL hijacking attack. This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of directory search paths at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a malicious DLL file on the targeted system. This file will execute when the vulnerable application launches. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system with local administrator privileges.\n\n- CVE-2021-44226: Razer Synapse before 3.7.0228.022817 allows privilege escalation because it relies on %PROGRAMDATA%\\\\Razer\\\\Synapse3\\\\Service\\\\bin even if %PROGRAMDATA%\\\\Razer has been created by any unprivileged user before Synapse is installed. The unprivileged user may have placed Trojan horse DLLs there.\n\n- CVE-2022-28965: Multiple DLL hijacking vulnerabilities via the components instup.exe and wsc_proxy.exe in Avast Premium Security before v21.11.2500 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted DLL file.\n\n- CVE-2022-1098: Delta Electronics DIAEnergie (all versions prior to 1.8.02.004) are vulnerable to a DLL hijacking condition. When combined with the Incorrect Default Permissions vulnerability of 4.2.2 above, this makes it possible for an attacker to escalate privileges\n\n- CVE-2022-23050: ManageEngine AppManager15 (Build No:15510) allows an authenticated admin user to upload a DLL file to perform a DLL hijack attack inside the 'working' folder through the 'Upload Files / Binaries' functionality.\n\n- CVE-2022-22736: If Firefox was installed to a world-writable directory, a local privilege escalation could occur when Firefox searched the current directory for system libraries. However the install directory is not world-writable by default.<br>*This bug only affects Firefox for Windows in a non-default installation. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 96.\n\n- CVE-2022-32222: A cryptographic vulnerability exists on Node.js on linux in versions of 18.x prior to 18.40.0 which allowed a default path for openssl.cnf that might be accessible under some circumstances to a non-admin user instead of /etc/ssl as was the case in versions prior to the upgrade to OpenSSL 3.\n\n- CVE-2021-36631: Untrusted search path vulnerability in Baidunetdisk Version 7.4.3 and earlier allows an attacker to gain privileges via a Trojan horse DLL in an unspecified directory.\n\n- CVE-2022-25348: Untrusted search path vulnerability in AttacheCase ver.4.0.2.7 and earlier allows an attacker to gain privileges and execute arbitrary code via a Trojan horse DLL in an unspecified directory.\n\n- CVE-2022-28128: Untrusted search path vulnerability in AttacheCase ver.3.6.1.0 and earlier allows an attacker to gain privileges and execute arbitrary code via a Trojan horse DLL in an unspecified directory.\n\n- CVE-2022-41796: Untrusted search path vulnerability in the installer of Content Transfer (for Windows) Ver.1.3 and prior allows an attacker to gain privileges via a Trojan horse DLL in an unspecified directory.\n\n- CVE-2022-48422: ONLYOFFICE Docs through 7.3 on certain Linux distributions allows local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse libgcc_s.so.1 in the current working directory, which may be any directory in which an ONLYOFFICE document is located.\n\n- CVE-2022-0166: A privilege escalation vulnerability in the McAfee Agent prior to 5.7.5. McAfee Agent uses openssl.cnf during the build process to specify the OPENSSLDIR variable as a subdirectory within the installation directory. A low privilege user could have created subdirectories and executed arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges by creating the appropriate pathway to the specifically created malicious openssl.cnf file.\n\n- CVE-2022-39286: Jupyter Core is a package for the core common functionality of Jupyter projects. Jupyter Core prior to version 4.11.2 contains an arbitrary code execution vulnerability in `jupyter_core` that stems from `jupyter_core` executing untrusted files in CWD. This vulnerability allows one user to run code as another. Version 4.11.2 contains a patch for this issue. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-20001: fish is a command line shell. fish version 3.1.0 through version 3.3.1 is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution. git repositories can contain per-repository configuration that change the behavior of git, including running arbitrary commands. When using the default configuration of fish, changing to a directory automatically runs `git` commands in order to display information about the current repository in the prompt. If an attacker can convince a user to change their current directory into one controlled by the attacker, such as on a shared file system or extracted archive, fish will run arbitrary commands under the attacker's control. This problem has been fixed in fish 3.4.0. Note that running git in these directories, including using the git tab completion, remains a potential trigger for this issue. As a workaround, remove the `fish_git_prompt` function from the prompt.\n\n- CVE-2021-28953: The unofficial C/C++ Advanced Lint extension before 1.9.0 for Visual Studio Code allows attackers to execute arbitrary binaries if the user opens a crafted repository.\n\n- CVE-2022-23853: The LSP (Language Server Protocol) plugin in KDE Kate before 21.12.2 and KTextEditor before 5.91.0 tries to execute the associated LSP server binary when opening a file of a given type. If this binary is absent from the PATH, it will try running the LSP server binary in the directory of the file that was just opened (due to a misunderstanding of the QProcess API, that was never intended). This can be an untrusted directory.\n\n- CVE-2022-22528: SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) - version 16.0, installation makes an entry in the system PATH environment variable in Windows platform which, under certain conditions, allows a Standard User to execute malicious Windows binaries which may lead to privilege escalation on the local system. The issue is with the ASE installer and does not impact other ASE binaries. \n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-668 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-668 (ChildOf)",

This often exists in Linux-based code assuming the controlled nature of the root directory (/) or its subdirectories (/etc, etc), or a code that recursively accesses the parent directory. In Windows, the drive root and some of its subdirectories have weak permissions by default, which makes them uncontrolled.\n\n\nIn some Unix-based systems, a PATH might be created that contains an empty element, e.g. by splicing an empty variable into the PATH. This empty element can be interpreted as equivalent to the current working directory, which might be an untrusted search element.\n\n\nIn software package management frameworks (e.g., npm, RubyGems, or PyPi), the framework may identify dependencies on third-party libraries or other packages, then consult a repository that contains the desired package. The framework may search a public repository before a private repository. This could be exploited by attackers by placing a malicious package in the public repository that has the same name as a package from the private repository. The search path might not be directly under control of the developer relying on the framework, but this search order effectively contains an untrusted element.\n",
