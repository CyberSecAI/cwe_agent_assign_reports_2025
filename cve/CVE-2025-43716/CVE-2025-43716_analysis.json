  "description": "A **directory traversal vulnerability** exists in Ivanti LANDesk Management Gateway through 4.2-1.9. By appending %3F.php to the URI of the /client/index.php endpoint, an attacker can bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access to various endpoints such as /client/index.php%3F.php/gsb/firewall.php within the management web panel, potentially exposing sensitive device information.

Information Extraction:**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Path traversal in the `/client/index.php` endpoint.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability leading to broken access control.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to the administrative management panel, allowing retrieval of sensitive information, including user lists, firewall settings and rules, certificates, and other critical configuration data.\n*   **Attack vectors:** Accessing the vulnerable endpoint by appending \"%3F.php\" to the URI.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated attacker.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** The device has reached its end-of-life (EoL), and no patches are available. The recommended mitigation is to replace the device or implement strict network access controls.\n\n**3. Additional Details:**\n\n*   The content provides more detail than the official CVE description would likely contain, including specific endpoints and the method of exploitation.",

CWE-306 is included as a secondary weakness because the path traversal allows access to areas that should be protected by authentication, suggesting a lack of authentication. Both CWE-22 and CWE-306 are base-level CWEs which is the preferred level of abstraction.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper limitation of a pathname** (CWE-22) which allows bypassing access controls. This leads to **missing authentication for critical functions** (CWE-306) as the attacker gains unauthorized access to sensitive endpoints. The chain highlights how a path traversal vulnerability can lead to a broken authentication scheme and exposure of sensitive data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment strongly indicates CWE-22 as the primary weakness due to the **directory traversal vulnerability** described in the vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary. The ability to bypass access controls further suggests that authentication is either missing or improperly implemented, motivating the inclusion of CWE-306 as a secondary weakness. The evidence is strong, and the selected CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states a \"**directory traversal vulnerability**\" exists, which directly aligns with CWE-22. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating: \"Root cause of vulnerability: Path traversal in the `/client/index.php` endpoint\" and \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Path traversal vulnerability leading to broken access control.\" The ability to \"bypass access controls\" points towards a potential lack of authentication, which is why CWE-306 was also included.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-912: Hidden Functionality\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains functionality that is not documented, not part of the specification, and not accessible through an interface or command sequence that is obvious to the product's users or administrators.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
