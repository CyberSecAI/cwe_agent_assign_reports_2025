# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-43716

## Description

A **directory traversal vulnerability** exists in Ivanti LANDesk Management Gateway through 4.2-1.9. By appending %3F.php to the URI of the /client/index.php endpoint, an attacker can bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access to various endpoints such as /client/index.php%3F.php/gsb/firewall.php within the management web panel, potentially exposing sensitive device information. NOTE This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Weakness:** directory traversal vulnerability
- **Impact:** bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access to various endpoints
- **Attacker:** attacker
- **Product:** Ivanti LANDesk Management Gateway
- **Version:** through 4.2-1.9
- **Component:** /client/index.php endpoint

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-22 | Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is that CWE-22 is a base-level weakness describing path traversal. CWE-306 is included as a secondary weakness because the path traversal allows access to areas that should be protected by authentication, suggesting a lack of authentication. Both CWE-22 and CWE-306 are base-level CWEs which is the preferred level of abstraction.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **improper limitation of a pathname** (CWE-22) which allows bypassing access controls. This leads to **missing authentication for critical functions** (CWE-306) as the attacker gains unauthorized access to sensitive endpoints. The chain highlights how a path traversal vulnerability can lead to a broken authentication scheme and exposure of sensitive data.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment strongly indicates CWE-22 as the primary weakness due to the **directory traversal vulnerability** described in the vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary. The ability to bypass access controls further suggests that authentication is either missing or improperly implemented, motivating the inclusion of CWE-306 as a secondary weakness. The evidence is strong, and the selected CWEs are at the appropriate level of specificity.

The vulnerability description clearly states a "**directory traversal vulnerability**" exists, which directly aligns with CWE-22. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating: "Root cause of vulnerability: Path traversal in the `/client/index.php` endpoint" and "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Path traversal vulnerability leading to broken access control." The ability to "bypass access controls" points towards a potential lack of authentication, which is why CWE-306 was also included.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the product does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-912: Hidden Functionality
**Abstraction Level**: Class

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
