Affected is the function qrCode of the file src/main/java/io/github/controller/QrCodeController.java. The manipulation of the argument w/h leads to resource consumption. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This product is using a rolling release to provide continious delivery. Therefore, no version details for affected nor updated releases are available.",
