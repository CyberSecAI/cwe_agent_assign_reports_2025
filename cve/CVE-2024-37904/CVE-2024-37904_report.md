# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-37904

## Description

Minder is an open source Software Supply Chain Security Platform. Minders Git provider is vulnerable to a denial of service from a maliciously configured GitHub repository. The Git provider clones users repositories using the `github.com/go-git/go-git/v5` library on lines `L55-L89`. The Git provider does the following on the lines `L56-L62`. First, it sets the `CloneOptions`, specifying the url, the depth etc. It then validates the options. It then sets up an in-memory filesystem, to which it clones and Finally, it clones the repository. The `(g *Git) Clone()` method is vulnerable to a DoS attack A Minder user can instruct Minder to clone a large repository which will exhaust memory and crash the Minder server. The root cause of this vulnerability is a combination of the following conditions 1. Users can control the Git URL which Minder clones, 2. Minder **does not enforce a size limit** to the repository, 3. Minder clones the entire repository into memory. This issue has been addressed in commit `7979b43` which has been included in release version v0.0.52. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** does not enforce a size limit
- **Impact:** ['DoS attack', 'denial of service', 'exhaust memory and crash']
- **Vector:** maliciously configured GitHub repository
- **Product:** Minder
- **Version:** before v0.0.52
- **Component:** Git provider

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-770 | Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. The application **does not enforce a size limit** on the repository being cloned, leading to resource exhaustion. |
| CWE-789 | Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value | 0.7 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE. Cloning a large repository into memory based on user-controlled input, without validation of size, leads to excessive memory allocation. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-770 Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**, as the system does not impose size limits on the cloned repository. A related weakness is **CWE-789 Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value**, since the lack of size limits results in excessive memory allocation. **CWE-789** is a child of **CWE-770**, providing more specific details about the memory allocation issue.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain begins with the lack of size limit on the repository being cloned (**CWE-770**). This leads to cloning of a large repository into memory based on user-controlled input (**CWE-789**), culminating in memory exhaustion and denial of service.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis strongly points to **CWE-770** as the primary weakness because the root cause is the **failure to limit or throttle the allocation of resources**, specifically the size of the repository being cloned. The vulnerability description highlights that the Minder system **does not enforce a size limit** on the repository. The resulting memory exhaustion is a direct consequence of this missing limit. The description states "A Minder user can instruct Minder to clone a large repository which will exhaust memory and crash the Minder server".

**CWE-789** is considered a secondary weakness, as it describes the specific case of allocating excessive memory. However, the more general **CWE-770** better captures the fundamental issue of resource management.

The hierarchical relationship between **CWE-770** and **CWE-789** confirms that **CWE-789** is a more specific instance of the broader resource allocation problem described by **CWE-770**.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component
in another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the
intended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.
