# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-11009

## Vulnerability Description
The Internal Linking for SEO traffic & Ranking Auto internal links (100% automatic) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **time-based SQL Injection** via the post_id parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.1 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11009

**Vulnerable Software:** WordPress plugin "Internal Linking for SEO traffic & Ranking â€“ Auto internal links (100% automatic)" versions <= 1.2.1

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization and lack of prepared statements when handling user-supplied input, specifically the `post_id` parameter, in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to time-based SQL injection. This occurs because the `post_id` parameter is not properly escaped or validated before being used in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the WordPress database.
*   **Potential Data Manipulation**: Although not explicitly stated, SQL injection can potentially be used to modify data in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is conducted remotely via HTTP requests.
*   **Specific Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `post_id`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with administrative privileges or higher (Administrator+).
*   **Access to Admin Panel:** The attacker needs access to the WordPress admin panel.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerable code is present in the `LinksController.php` file.
* The SQL injection occurs due to the lack of prepared statements and proper sanitization when the plugin constructs SQL queries, specifically when handling the `post_id` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was patched in version 1.2.2 of the plugin.
* The plugin uses AJAX requests to interact with the server, which is where the vulnerable parameter is used.
* The fix involves adding capability checks, using `absint` for sanitizing the post ID, and most importantly, using prepared statements.
* The provided diffs in `LinksController.php` clearly show the changes made to add capability checks, proper sanitization of input parameters (`post_id` and others) using `absint` and `esc_url_raw`, and to implement prepared statements using `$wpdb->prepare()` to prevent SQL injection.
* The updated code also uses more robust checks for valid IDs and includes error handling to return more specific error messages.
