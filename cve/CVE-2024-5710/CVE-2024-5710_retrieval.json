This vulnerability allows attackers to perform unauthorized actions such as creating, updating, viewing, deleting, blocking, and unblocking any teams, as well as adding or deleting any member to or from any teams. The vulnerability stems from **insufficient access control** checks in various team management endpoints, enabling attackers to exploit these functionalities without proper authorization.',

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    berriai/litellm version 1.34.34 is vulnerable to **improper access control** in its team management functionality. This vulnerability allows attackers to perform unauthorized actions such as creating, updating, viewing, deleting, blocking, and unblocking any teams, as well as adding or deleting any member to or from any teams. The vulnerability stems from **insufficient access control** checks in various team management endpoints, enabling attackers to exploit these functionalities without proper authorization.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'improper access control'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
