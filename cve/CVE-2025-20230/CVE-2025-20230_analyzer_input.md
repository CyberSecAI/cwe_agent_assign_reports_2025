# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-20230

## Vulnerability Description
In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.4.1, 9.3.3, 9.2.5, and 9.1.8, and versions below 3.8.38 and 3.7.23 of the Splunk Secure Gateway app on Splunk Cloud Platform, a low-privileged user that does not hold the admin or power Splunk roles could edit and delete other user data in App Key Value Store (KVStore) collections that the Splunk Secure Gateway app created. This is due to **missing access control and incorrect ownership** of the data in those KVStore collections.In the affected versions, the `nobody` user owned the data in the KVStore collections. This meant that there was no specific owner assigned to the data in those collections.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## CVE-2025-20230 Analysis

This content **relates** to CVE-2025-20230 as indicated by the advisory ID and CVE ID matching. It provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

Missing access control and incorrect ownership of data in App Key Value Store (KVStore) collections created by the Splunk Secure Gateway app. The `nobody` user owned the data, meaning no specific owner was assigned.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   CWE-284: Improper Access Control

**Impact of exploitation:**

A low-privileged user (not holding “admin” or “power” roles) could edit and delete other user data in the affected KVStore collections.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Network accessible
*   Low complexity

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Low-privileged user within the Splunk environment.
*   Network access.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Upgrade Splunk Enterprise to versions 9.4.1, 9.3.3, 9.2.5, 9.1.8, or higher.
*   Upgrade Splunk Secure Gateway app to versions 3.8.38 or 3.7.23 or higher.
*   Disable the Splunk Secure Gateway App (workaround).
*   Remove the Splunk Secure Gateway App (workaround, if not using related functionality).

**CVSSv3.1 Score:** 4.3 (Medium)

**CVSSv3.1 Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
