## Vulnerability Description
5ire is a cross-platform desktop artificial intelligence assistant and model context protocol client. Versions prior to 0.11.1 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting in chatbot responses due to **insufficient sanitization**. This, in turn, can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via unsafe Electron protocol handling and exposed Electron APIs. All users of 5ire client versions prior to patched releases, particularly those interacting with untrusted chatbots or pasting external content, are affected. Version 0.11.1 contains a patch for the issue.

**positive.security_31d8b277_20250624_140651.html:**

*   **Relates to CVE-2025-47777:** YES
*   **Extracted Information:**
    *   **Root cause of vulnerability:**
        *   Insufficient validation of user input that is later treated as a URL and opened with the help of the operating system.
    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
        *   Code execution by exploiting OS behavior for specific URI schemes and file extensions.
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in 3rd party application URL handlers.
    *   **Impact of exploitation:**
        *   Code execution.
    *   **Attack vectors:**
