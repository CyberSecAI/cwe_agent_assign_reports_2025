## Vulnerability Description
The hash table used to manage connections in picoquic before b80fd3f uses a **weak hash function**, allowing remote attackers to cause a considerable CPU load on the server (a Hash DoS attack) by initiating connections with colliding Source Connection IDs (SCIDs).

**Content from github.com_dbb8133c_20250624_123634.html (stripped)**

*   **Relevance:** The content directly relates to the picoquic library, which is mentioned in the CVE description. The commit history and file changes suggest the implementation of fixes related to hash functions.
*   **Extract:**
    *   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Hash Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks exploit the algorithmic complexity of hash tables when pushing them to their worst-case complexity. This is due to the use of weak hash functions, which allows for easy collisions.
    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is present in the implementation of the hash table used by the peer SCID to manage connections.
    *   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker is able to significantly slow down vulnerable servers. Some experimental results obtained with one vulnerable library showed us that the implementation suffered a factor 300 slowdown, when only 10k parallel connections were initiated by malicious clients.
    *   **Attack vectors:** An attacker can freely choose CIDs that collide under the target hash function used by a vulnerable server.
    *   **Mitigation or fix:** The code includes modifications to the hash function, including the introduction of `siphash.c` and modifications to `picohash.c` and `picoquic_internal.h`.  The fix is at commit `b80fd3f`.
*   **More Detail than Official CVE Description:** Yes, the content provides much more detail by explaining the root cause of the vulnerability, the attack vectors, and the impact of exploitation, along with the files changed.

**Content from github.com_de97bab9_20250624_123632.html (stripped)**

*   **Relevance:** The content is a technical advisory on Hash Denial-of-Service attacks in multiple QUIC implementations. The document explicitly mentions and describes a vulnerability in `picoquic`, which is specified in the CVE.
*   **Extract:**
    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Hash DoS attacks exploit collisions in weak hash functions, triggering the worst-case performance of hash tables. The vulnerability is present in hash table implementations, where the peer SCID is used to index the connection. Many server implementations use hash tables to manage connections, and furthermore that they use the peer SCID as a key to index the connection.
    *   **Impact of exploitation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker is able to significantly slow down vulnerable servers. Some experimental results obtained with one vulnerable library showed us that the implementation suffered a factor 300 slowdown, when only 10k parallel connections were initiated by malicious clients.
    *   **Attack vectors:** An attacker can freely choose CIDs that collide under the target hash function used by a vulnerable server.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Malicious clients can induce significant burden with minimal effort, while the server bears the computational load.
    *   **Mitigation or fix:** The advisory mentions `picoquic` fixed at commit `b80fd3f` on branch master, dated 2025-02-18, tracked under CVE-2025-24946.
*   **More Detail than Official CVE Description:** Yes, the content provides more detail by explaining the root cause of the vulnerability, the attack vectors, and the impact of exploitation.
