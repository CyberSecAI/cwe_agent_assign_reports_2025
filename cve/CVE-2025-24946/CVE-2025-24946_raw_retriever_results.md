# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-24946

# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2025-24946
## Query
The hash table used to manage connections in picoquic before b80fd3f uses a weak hash function, allowing remote attackers to cause a considerable CPU load on the server (a Hash DoS attack) by initiating connections with colliding Source Connection IDs (SCIDs).

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'weak hash function'
