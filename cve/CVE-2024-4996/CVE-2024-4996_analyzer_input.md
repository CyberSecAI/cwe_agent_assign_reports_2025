# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-4996

## Vulnerability Description
Use of a **hard-coded password** for a database administrator account created during Wapro ERPinstallation allows an attacker to retrieve embedded sensitive data stored in the database. The password is same among all Wapro ERPinstallations.This issue affects Wapro ERP Desktop versions before 8.90.0.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **hard-coded password**
- **impact:** retrieve embedded sensitive data
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Wapro ERP Desktop
- **version:** before 8.90.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-4996:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of hard-coded credentials within the Wapro ERP Desktop software. Specifically, a fixed password is used for a special database account across all installations of the software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials:** The primary weakness is the presence of a hard-coded password for a database account. This is a significant security flaw as it provides a known access method for unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain access to sensitive information stored in the database. Because the password is the same for all installations, a compromise on one system could enable an attacker to target other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves an attacker using the hard-coded password to gain access to the database. 
- The attacker would need to have network access to the database server or the ability to access it directly if the database is stored locally on the targeted machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to know the hard-coded password, which, by the nature of the vulnerability, is static and available to anyone with this knowledge.
- The attacker must have network connectivity to the database server or local access if the database is stored locally on the targeted machine.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of Wapro ERP Desktop software up to 8.90.0.
- The vulnerability was reported to CERT Polska, who coordinated the disclosure process.
