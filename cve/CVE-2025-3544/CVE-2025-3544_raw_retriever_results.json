This issue affects the function FCGI_CheckStringIfContainsSemicolon of the file /api/wizard/getCapabilityWeb of the component HTTP POST Request Handler. The manipulation leads to command injection. Access to the local network is required for this attack to succeed. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.",
