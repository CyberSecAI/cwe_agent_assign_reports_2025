# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-30140

## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered on G-Net Dashcam BB GONX devices. A Public Domain name is Used for the Internal Domain Name. It uses an unregistered public domain name as an internal domain, creating a security risk. This domain was not owned by GNET originally, allowing an attacker to register it and potentially intercept sensitive device traffic (it has since been registered by the vulnerability discoverer). If the dashcam or related services attempt to resolve this domain over the public Internet instead of locally, it could lead to data exfiltration or man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **use of unregistered public domain name**
- **weakness:** **domain name resolution over public internet**
- **product:** G-Net Dashcam BB GONX
- **impact:** ['data exfiltration', 'man-in-the-middle attacks']
- **attacker:** attacker

## Analysis of CVE-2025-30140 based on provided content

The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities found in the GNET G-ONX dashcam. Here's an extraction of information specifically related to **CVE-2025-30140**:

**CVE-2025-30140: Public Domain Used for Internal Domain Name**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The GNET G-ONX dashcam was configured to use a public domain name (with a ".com" TLD) as an internal domain name, and that domain was not registered.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of a public domain for internal purposes creates a security risk as it can be exploited by attackers.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers could potentially exploit the unregistered domain to compromise the dashcam and its associated network.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker could register the domain and potentially intercept traffic or launch attacks targeting the dashcam.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to register the domain name.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** The researchers registered the domain to protect dashcam owners and notified the manufacturer. The manufacturer needs to use a properly registered and secured domain for internal purposes.
