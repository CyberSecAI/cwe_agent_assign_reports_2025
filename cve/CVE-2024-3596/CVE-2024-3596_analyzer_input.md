# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-3596

## Vulnerability Description

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2024-3596:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The core issue lies in the RADIUS protocol's use of MD5 for integrity checks, specifically the Response Authenticator calculation. This calculation uses a simple MD5 hash of the packet and a shared secret: `Response Authenticator = MD5(packet + secret)`.
*   The vulnerability is due to the well-known weakness of MD5 regarding collision attacks, combined with predictable aspects of the RADIUS packet structure that allow for a chosen-prefix collision.
*   Specifically, the lack of mandatory integrity checks on Access-Request packets, which allows attackers to manipulate the content.
*   The Proxy-State attribute, intended for proxy-to-server signaling, inadvertently enables attackers to inject arbitrary data into packets to create the MD5 collision.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Integrity Check**: RADIUS relies on MD5, which is vulnerable to chosen-prefix collision attacks.
*   **Lack of Access-Request Authentication**: Access-Request packets do not have mandatory authentication or integrity checks, enabling attackers to forge them.
*   **Predictable Packet Structure**: Parts of RADIUS packets are predictable, allowing attackers to manipulate specific sections to control the MD5 hash output.
*   **Abuse of Proxy-State**: The Proxy-State attribute allows injection of arbitrary data without affecting client or server behavior, which can be used to trigger the MD5 collision.
*   **Clear-text Transmission**: RADIUS/UDP and RADIUS/TCP transmits most data unencrypted, except for some obfuscated fields relying on MD5.
*   **Vulnerable Shared Secrets**: Short or weak shared secrets are easily cracked using brute-force methods.
*   **Obfuscated Tunnel-Password in CoA-Request Packets**: The Request Authenticator for CoA-Request packets is not random, thus weakening the obfuscation of the Tunnel-Password attribute.
*   **Weak Authentication Methods**: Protocols such as MS-CHAP are vulnerable to cracking attacks, revealing the underlying password.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass**: Attackers can forge RADIUS responses, bypassing server-side authentication.
*   **Authorization Manipulation**: Attackers can change the type of response, converting Access-Reject to Access-Accept, modifying authorization attributes.
*   **MFA Bypass**: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) can be circumvented by modifying Access-Challenge responses to Access-Accept.
*   **Data Modification**: Attributes in the RADIUS response can be modified, potentially redirecting user traffic.
*   **Compromise of Shared Secrets:** Attackers may be able to brute force shared secrets, further exposing the network.
*   **Exposure of Personal Data**:  Clear-text transmission of RADIUS traffic can expose sensitive user data such as usernames, passwords, device information, and locations.
*  **Redirection Attacks:** Attackers could redirect user traffic to malicious websites by injecting vendor specific attributes.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** The attacker must be positioned on the network path between the RADIUS client (NAS) and the server. This could be on the same LAN or even across the internet in case RADIUS/UDP is used in clear text.
*   **Packet Interception and Modification:** The attacker intercepts Access-Request packets, modifies them, and injects malicious data.
*   **Chosen-Prefix Attack**: The attacker exploits the MD5 weakness by manipulating the content of the Access-Request packet (primarily using Proxy-State) to force a collision of the hash value.
*   **Response Spoofing**: The attacker modifies the RADIUS server's response to an Access-Request before it reaches the client.
*   **Proxy Abuse**: If proxies are used, they can be targeted in the chain, and can modify packets.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have access to the network where RADIUS communication occurs, allowing them to eavesdrop, modify, and inject packets.
*   **Knowledge of RADIUS Protocol:** The attacker must understand the structure and workings of the RADIUS protocol, including the use of MD5 and the attributes involved.
*   **MD5 Collision Calculation**: The attacker needs to use tools to find MD5 collisions with chosen prefixes. This capability is widely available now.
*  **Ability to Perform a Man-in-the-Middle Attack**: Ability to intercept and modify packets.
* **Optional Resources:** Although not mandatory, GPU resources can significantly speed up the MD5 collision finding.
