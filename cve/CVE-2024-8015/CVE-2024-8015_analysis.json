  "description": "In Progress Telerik Report Server versions prior to 2024 Q3 (10.2.24.924), a remote code execution attack is possible through object injection via an **insecure type resolution** vulnerability.",

  },
  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from an **insecure type resolution**, specifically, the \"Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection')\" (CWE-470). This indicates that the application uses user-provided input to determine which classes or code should be executed.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n*   **Unsafe Reflection:** The core weakness is the use of externally controlled input in the process of resolving types. This is often done with reflection and may allow an attacker to force the application to instantiate or load arbitrary classes.\n*   **Object Injection:** The vulnerability makes the application susceptible to object injection attacks where an attacker can manipulate the data provided to cause the system to create malicious objects.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   The attack vector is through user-provided input that influences type resolution within the Telerik Report Server. The specific method for delivering this malicious input is not detailed in this content.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to provide input that will be processed by the vulnerable type resolution mechanism within the Telerik Report Server.\n*   The attacker would likely need to have access to the Telerik Report Server application.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*   **Affected Versions:** Telerik Report Server 2024 Q3 (10.2.24.806) and earlier versions are affected.\n*   **Solution:** Upgrade to version 2024 Q3 (10.2.24.924) or later.\n*   **Mitigation:** As a temporary measure, changing the Report Server's Application Pool user to one with limited permissions can mitigate the vulnerability.\n*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.1, indicating a critical severity.\n*   **Credit:** Markus Wulftange with CODE WHITE GmbH is credited for the responsible disclosure of this vulnerability.",

The secondary CWE, CWE-470, represents **unsafe reflection** where externally-controlled input is used to select classes or code. CWE-470 can lead to object injection, which is a prerequisite for CWE-502. Both CWEs are base level, which is the preferred level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    cwe470[\"CWE-470: Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection')\"]\n    \n    cwe502 <--|CANFOLLOW| cwe470\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe502 primary\n    class cwe470 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insecure type resolution** (potentially leading to CWE-470), leading to object injection, and culminating in remote code execution via **deserialization of untrusted data** (CWE-502).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-502 as the primary weakness due to its prevalence in similar CVE descriptions and its direct relation to the vulnerability's impact (remote code execution via object injection). The retriever results also listed CWE-502 as a potential candidate. The evidence explicitly mentions \"object injection via an **insecure type resolution** vulnerability,\" which is a hallmark of deserialization issues where untrusted data leads to arbitrary object creation and code execution.\n\nCWE-470 was considered as a secondary weakness, as the **insecure type resolution** suggests the use of externally-controlled input to select classes or code, which is the definition of CWE-470. While the description doesn't explicitly state deserialization is happening, the presence of object injection strongly suggests it.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-917: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a framework such as a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g. \"eval\").\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
