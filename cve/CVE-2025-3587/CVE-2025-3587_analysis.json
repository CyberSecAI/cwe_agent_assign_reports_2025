The description indicates a problem with authorization, making CWE-285 a strong initial candidate. However, given the potential for more specific information, CWE-862 and CWE-639 were also considered.

The guidance reinforces this selection, highlighting that CWE-285 is appropriate when the issue involves improper or missing role checks.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states \"**improper authorization**,\" which directly supports the selection of CWE-285. While other CWEs like CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) were considered, the current information does not provide enough detail to definitively classify the vulnerability as specifically missing authorization or an authorization bypass. Therefore, CWE-285, as a broader class, is the most appropriate choice based on the available evidence. The selection of CWE-285 is at the optimal level of specificity given the information provided; if more details were available, a more specific child CWE might be selected.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
