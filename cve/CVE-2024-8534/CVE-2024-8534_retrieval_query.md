    ## WEAKNESS: 'Memory safety vulnerability'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity (Score: 368.74)

The product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data....

### 2. CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (Score: 363.61)

The product does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources....

### 3. CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write (Score: 353.54)

The product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....

### 4. CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition (Score: 352.52)

The product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state....

### 5. CWE-287: Improper Authentication (Score: 350.28)

When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct....
