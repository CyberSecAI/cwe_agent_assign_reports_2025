  "description": "VRCX is an assistant/companion application for VRChat. In versions prior to 2024.03.23, a CefSharp browser with over-permission and **cross-site scripting** via overlay notification can be combined to result in remote command execution. These vulnerabilities are patched in VRCX 2023.12.24. In addition to the patch, VRCX maintainers worked with the VRC team and blocked the older version of VRCX on the VRCs API side. Users who use the older version of VRCX must update their installation to continue using VRCX.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-42366:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from a combination of two weaknesses:\n\n1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Overlay Notifications:** The VRCX application displays in-game notifications in an overlay. A flaw in how these notifications are processed allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code. Specifically, VRChat log parsing issues permit attackers to spoof display names, bypassing the usual sanitization and injecting malicious code.\n\n2.  **Over-Permissioned CefSharp Browser:** The VRCX application uses a CefSharp browser to render UI elements and expose the `AppApi` object to the browser. The `AppApi` object includes powerful methods, such as `StartGameFromPath`, that can execute arbitrary commands on the host system.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **XSS:** The primary vulnerability is an XSS vulnerability caused by insufficient input sanitization when processing VRChat log data used for overlay notifications.\n*   **Unrestricted Command Execution:** The `StartGameFromPath` function within the `AppApi` lacks sufficient checks and allows for arbitrary command execution by providing the function with a path and arguments.\n*   **Overly Permissive Javascript Bindings:**  The CefSharp browser has access to the `AppApi` object, allowing Javascript to call the function.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the user's machine. By injecting malicious JavaScript via an overlay notification, an attacker can leverage the `AppApi.StartGameFromPath` function to execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to:\n\n*   Complete control of the user's system.\n*   Installation of malware.\n*   Data exfiltration.\n*   Other malicious activities.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   The attack vector is via malicious log data that spoofs a user's display name that is then displayed through the overlay notification. This requires a malicious user to be in the same VRChat instance as the target.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to generate VRChat logs that contain a spoofed display name.\n*   The attacker must be in the same VRChat instance as the target user to trigger the crafted notification.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was patched in VRCX version 2024.03.23.\n*   The VRC team also blocked older versions of VRCX on their API side to mitigate the risk.\n*   The provided content identifies the specific lines of code within the application where the vulnerabilities exist.\n*   The `AppApi` object is exposed to the browser, which is a security risk.\n*   The `StartGameFromPath` method accepts an executable path and arguments, providing a way to execute arbitrary commands.\n*   The attacker can use javascript `CefSharp.BindObjectAsync('AppApi')` to gain access to the `AppApi` object and invoke the `StartGameFromPath` method.",

Then the malicious code leverages overly permissive Javascript Bindings (CWE-863) to execute arbitrary commands, leading to Remote Command Execution.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section, which details the root cause as a combination of XSS and overly permissive Javascript bindings. The primary CWE is CWE-79 [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] because the vulnerability leverages **cross-site scripting** via overlay notification. The XSS allows the attacker to inject malicious JavaScript. The injected JavaScript can then call the `StartGameFromPath` function.\nCWE-863 [Incorrect Authorization] is a secondary weakness because the Javascript Bindings allowed the `AppApi` object to be accessed, but the more specific root cause is the **Cross-Site Scripting** vulnerability.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
