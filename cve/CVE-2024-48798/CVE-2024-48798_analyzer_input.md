### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** obtain sensitive information
- **vector:** firmware update process
- **attacker:** remote attacker
- **product:** Hubble Connected (com.hubbleconnected.vervelife)
- **version:** 2.00.81

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to a vulnerability involving a lack of access control in the firmware update process for "com.hubbleconnected.vervelife", which aligns with the general idea of a CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper access controls on the Hubble Connected firmware server. The server directly provides firmware files when requested via a URL obtained from reverse engineering the application, without requiring any authentication or authorization.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Incorrect Access Control:** The core issue is the absence of access controls on the firmware server, allowing anyone with the URL to download firmware files.
    *   **Firmware Leakage:** The lack of access control leads to the exposure and potential download of firmware files.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Unauthorized Firmware Access:** Attackers can download the latest firmware before its public release.
    *   **Security Analysis:** Allows attackers to analyze the firmware for vulnerabilities and proprietary information.
    *   **Malicious Firmware Modification:** Enables attackers to create modified firmware images with malicious code.
    *   **Compromised Firmware Distribution:** Attackers could distribute compromised firmware updates to unsuspecting users.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector is through HTTPS requests to the firmware server using URLs extracted from the mobile application.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Reverse Engineering:** The attacker must be able to reverse engineer the `com.hubbleconnected.vervelife` application to discover the firmware download URLs.
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTPS requests to the firmware server.
    *   No user authentication or authorization is required.

**Technical Details:**

The attacker reverse-engineered the `com.hubbleconnected.vervelife` app to identify how firmware update URLs are generated by using the `getOTAUrl` method in the `DrakePlusProduct` class. The attacker then crafted HTTPS GET requests using the extracted URL to the firmware server (`ota.hubble.in`). The server responded with a JSON payload containing download links to firmware images. This allowed the attacker to directly download the firmware. The report details the exact HTTP requests and responses.

The report indicates that the attacker was able to download 4 different firmware files.

**Remediation:**

The report suggests:

*   Implement proper access control mechanisms on the firmware server. This could involve verifying device IDs and user IDs before allowing firmware downloads.
*   Implement authentication for firmware update requests. The app should use authentication credentials when requesting firmware updates.

**Additional Notes:**
The report emphasizes that it is for informational purposes only and the author is not responsible for any misuse of the information.
