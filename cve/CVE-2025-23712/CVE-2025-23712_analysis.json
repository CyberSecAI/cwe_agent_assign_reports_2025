Classified as Broken Access Control (OWASP Top 10 A1).\n\nImpact of exploitation:\nA malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions. The specific impact varies case by case.\n\nAttack vectors:\nCross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\nUnauthenticated.\n\nMitigation or fix:\nUpdate to version 2.3.0 or later. Patchstack users can enable auto-update for vulnerable plugins.\n\nAdditional details:\n- CVSS score: 7.1 (Low severity)\n- Vulnerable versions: <= 2.2.9\n- Fixed in version: 2.3.0\n- Reported by: SOPROBRO on October 30, 2024\n- Published by Patchstack on January 16, 2025.\n\nThe content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.",

The selection of **CWE-79** [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')] is at the Base level because it is a general type of Cross-Site Scripting.\n\n**CWEs Considered But Not Used:**\n\n*   CWE-89 [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')], CWE-601 [URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')], CWE-918 [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)], and CWE-434 [Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type] were considered but not used because they are not directly supported by the vulnerability description.",
