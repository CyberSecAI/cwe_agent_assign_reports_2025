This can lead to secondary weaknesses like Stored **XSS (CWE-79)** because the attacker can inject malicious scripts that are then stored and executed by other users.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe79 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe352\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of CSRF protection (CWE-352)** which enables an attacker to inject malicious input without proper authorization. This leads to the **Stored XSS (CWE-79)** vulnerability.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary root cause of this vulnerability is the **lack of CSRF protection (CWE-352)** in the MFPlugin. This allows attackers to perform actions on behalf of users without their consent. Because of this **lack of protection**, an attacker can inject malicious scripts leading to **Stored XSS (CWE-79)**. The retriever results also suggest both CWE-352 and CWE-79 as relevant.
