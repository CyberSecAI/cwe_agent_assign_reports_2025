# Vulnerability Description

    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved iio light Add check for array bounds in veml6075_read_int_time_ms The array contains only 5 elements, but the index calculated by veml6075_read_int_time_index can range from 0 to 7, which could lead to out-of-bounds access. The check prevents this issue. Coverity Issue CID 1574309 (#1 of 1) **Out-of-bounds read** (OVERRUN) overrun-local Overrunning array veml6075_it_ms of 5 4-byte elements at element index 7 (byte offset 31) using index int_index (which evaluates to 7) This is hardening against potentially broken hardware. Good to have but not necessary to backport.

### 4. CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset (Score: 528.54)

The product performs pointer arithmetic on a valid pointer, but it uses an offset that can point outside of the intended range of valid memory locations for the resulting pointer....

### 5. CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound) (Score: 521.72)

The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result....
