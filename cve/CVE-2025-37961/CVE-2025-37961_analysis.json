  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ipvs fix uninit-value for saddr in do_output_route4 syzbot reports for uninit-value for the saddr argument [1]. commit 4754957f04f5 (ipvs do not use random local source address for tunnels) already implies that the input value of saddr should be ignored but the code is still reading it which can prevent to connect the route.
