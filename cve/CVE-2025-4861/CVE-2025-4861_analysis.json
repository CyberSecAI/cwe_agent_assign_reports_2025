Content from github.com\\_bb943b89\\_20250624\\_162849.html (stripped)**\n\n*   **Relates to CVE-2025-4861:** YES\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the \"/admin/admin-profile.php\" file. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the \"contactnumber\" parameter, which allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection. The content indicates the vulnerability is present in the \"contactnumber\" parameter.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database, cause sensitive data leakage, tamper with data, gain complete control over the system, and disrupt services.\n*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is the \"contactnumber\" parameter within the POST request to the \"/admin/admin-profile.php\" file.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to submit a crafted POST request to the vulnerable file, including a malicious payload within the \"contactnumber\" parameter. No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:**\n    *   Employ prepared statements and parameter binding.\n    *   Conduct input validation and filtering.\n    *   Minimize database user permissions.\n*   **More detail than the official CVE description:** Yes, the content provides a specific payload, the affected file, and detailed impact descriptions. It also includes steps for mitigation.\n\n**2.  Content from phpgurukul.com\\_de9331c8\\_20250624\\_162851.html (text)**\n\n*   **Relates to CVE-2025-4861:** NO\n*   **Reason:** This content is a blog and resource website for PHP tutorials and projects, not directly related to the specific SQL injection vulnerability identified in the GitHub content.",

The retriever results also heavily favored CWE-89. There weren't other relationships to consider as alternatives in this case. The abstraction level of Base is appropriate as it directly represents the **root cause** of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    \n    class cwe89 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')** (CWE-89) due to insufficient validation of the \"contactnumber\" parameter.\n2.  **Impact:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database, cause sensitive data leakage, tamper with data, gain complete control over the system, and disrupt services.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the explicit statement in the vulnerability description that the manipulation of the \"contactnumber\" argument leads to **sql injection**. This is strongly supported by the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which states: \"A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the \"/admin/admin-profile.php\" file. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the \"contactnumber\" parameter, which allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries.\" The retriever results also clearly pointed to CWE-89 as the most relevant CWE.
