  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2025-0684', description='A flaw was found in grub2. When performing a symlink lookup from a reiserfs filesystem, grubs reiserfs fs module uses user-controlled parameters from the filesystem geometry to determine the internal buffer size, however, it **improperly checks for integer overflows**. A maliciouly crafted filesystem may lead some of those buffer size calculations to overflow, causing it to perform a grub_malloc() operation with a smaller size than expected. As a result, the grub_reiserfs_read_symlink() will call grub_reiserfs_read_real() with a overflown length parameter, leading to a heap based out-of-bounds write during data reading. This flaw may be leveraged to corrupt grubs internal critical data and can result in arbitrary code execution, by-passing secure boot protections.', key_phrases={'component': 'reiserfs fs module', 'rootcause': 'improperly checks for integer overflows', 'vector': 'maliciously crafted filesystem', 'weakness': 'heap based out-of-bounds write, buffer size calculations overflow', 'product': 'grub2', 'impact': \"['arbitrary code execution', 'bypass secure boot protections', 'corrupt grubs internal critical data']\", 'attacker': '', 'version': ''}, reference_content='## Analysis of CVE-2025-0684 Content\\n\\nHere\\'s an analysis of the provided content, focusing on information relevant to CVE-2025-0684, as described in the bug report:\\n\\n**1. Verification:**\\n\\nThe content directly references \"CVE-2025-0684\" and provides a description aligning with a vulnerability in `grub2` related to `reiserfs`. Therefore, the content is **RELEVANT**.\\n\\n**2. Extracted Information:**\\n\\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow when handling symlinks in the `reiserfs` filesystem module within `grub2`. The vulnerability stems from improper checks for integer overflows when calculating buffer sizes using user-controlled parameters from the filesystem geometry.\\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n    *   Integer overflow\\n    *   Heap-based out-of-bounds write\\n*   **Impact of exploitation:**\\n    *   Corruption of `grub`\\'s internal critical data.\\n    *   Potential for arbitrary code execution, bypassing secure boot protections.\\n*   **Attack vectors:**\\n    *   Maliciously crafted `reiserfs` filesystem.\\n    *   Exploitation occurs during symlink lookup.\\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n    *   Ability to create or modify a `reiserfs` filesystem.\\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** Not specified in this content.\\n\\n**3. Details beyond official CVE description:**\\n\\nThe bug report provides a more detailed explanation of *how* the integer overflow leads to the out-of-bounds write, specifically mentioning the `grub_reiserfs_read_symlink()` and `grub_reiserfs_read_real()` functions and the overflowed length parameter.

Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-21668: Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n\n- CVE-2008-1440: lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop\n\n- CVE-2008-2374: lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-31401: An issue was discovered in tcp_rcv() in nptcp.c in HCC embedded InterNiche 4.0.1. The TCP header processing code doesn't sanitize the value of the IP total length field (header length + data length). With a crafted IP packet, an integer overflow occurs whenever the value of the IP data length is calculated by subtracting the length of the header from the total length of the IP packet.\n\n- CVE-2021-31802: NETGEAR R7000 1.0.11.116 devices have a heap-based Buffer Overflow that is exploitable from the local network without authentication. The vulnerability exists within the handling of an HTTP request. An attacker can leverage this to execute code as root. The problem is that a user-provided length value is trusted during a backup.cgi file upload. The attacker must add a \\\\n before the Content-Length header.\n\n- CVE-2021-37663: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions due to incomplete validation in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeV2`, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/84d053187cb80d975ef2b9684d4b61981bca0c41/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_op.cc#L59) has some validation but does not check that `min_range` and `max_range` both have the same non-zero number of elements. If `axis` is provided (i.e., not `-1`), then validation should check that it is a value in range for the rank of `input` tensor and then the lengths of `min_range` and `max_range` inputs match the `axis` dimension of the `input` tensor. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 6da6620efad397c85493b8f8667b821403516708. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-37665: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions due to incomplete validation in MKL implementation of requantization, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/mkl/mkl_requantization_range_per_channel_op.cc) does not validate the dimensions of the `input` tensor. A similar issue occurs in `MklRequantizePerChannelOp`. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/mkl/mkl_requantize_per_channel_op.cc) does not perform full validation for all the input arguments. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 9e62869465573cb2d9b5053f1fa02a81fce21d69 and in the Github commit 203214568f5bc237603dbab6e1fd389f1572f5c9. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0.

Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-25727: Memory Corruption in modem due to improper length check while copying into memory in Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Voice & Music\n\n- CVE-2022-25793: A Stack-based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in Autodesk 3ds Max 2022, 2021, and 2020 may lead to code execution through the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer when parsing ActionScript Byte Code files.

This does _not_ affect source code found on aescrypt.com, nor is the vulnerability present when providing a password or a key via the `-p` or `-k` command-line options. The problem was fixed via in commit 68761851b and will be included in release 3.16. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should us the `-p` or `-k` options to provide a password or key.\n\n- CVE-2022-36063: Azure RTOS USBx is a USB host, device, and on-the-go (OTG) embedded stack, fully integrated with Azure RTOS ThreadX and available for all Azure RTOS ThreadX\u2013supported processors. Azure RTOS USBX implementation of host support for USB CDC ECM includes an integer underflow and a buffer overflow in the `_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function which may be potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution or denial of service. Setting mac address string descriptor length to a `0` or `1` allows an attacker to introduce an integer underflow followed (string_length) by a buffer overflow of the `cdc_ecm -> ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id` array. This may allow one to redirect the code execution flow or introduce a denial of service. The fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel). Improved mac address string descriptor length validation to check for unexpectedly small values may be used as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-36620: D-link DIR-816 A2_v1.10CNB04, DIR-878 DIR_878_FW1.30B08.img is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via /goform/addRouting.\n\n- CVE-2022-37134: D-link DIR-816 A2_v1.10CNB04.img is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via /goform/form2Wan.cgi.

If a BGP update message is received over an established BGP session where a BGP SR-TE policy tunnel attribute is malformed and BGP update tracing flag is enabled, the rpd will core. This issue can happen with any BGP session as long as the previous conditions are met. This issue can not propagate as the crash occurs as soon as the malformed update is received. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S1; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2-S2, 21.1R3. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 20.4R1.\n\n- CVE-2022-4171: The demon image annotation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to improper input validation in versions up to, and including 5.0. This is due to the plugin improperly validating the number of characters supplied during an annotation despite there being a setting to limit the number characters input. This means that unauthenticated attackers can bypass the length restrictions and input more characters than allowed via the settings.\n\n- CVE-2022-25375: An issue was discovered in drivers/usb/gadget/function/rndis.c in the Linux kernel before 5.16.10. The RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command.

In affected versions the Istio control plane, `istiod`, is vulnerable to a request processing error, allowing a malicious attacker that sends a specially crafted message which results in the control plane crashing. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15012, but does not require any authentication from the attacker. For simple installations, Istiod is typically only reachable from within the cluster, limiting the blast radius. However, for some deployments, especially [multicluster](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/multicluster/primary-remote/) topologies, this port is exposed over the public internet. There are no effective workarounds, beyond upgrading. Limiting network access to Istiod to the minimal set of clients can help lessen the scope of the vulnerability to some extent.\n\n- CVE-2021-31556: An issue was discovered in the Oauth extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. MWOAuthConsumerSubmitControl.php does not ensure that the length of an RSA key will fit in a MySQL blob.\n\n- CVE-2022-20686: Multiple vulnerabilities in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) functionality of Cisco ATA 190 Series Analog Telephone Adapter firmware could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device and cause the LLDP service to restart. These vulnerabilities are due to missing length validation of certain LLDP packet header fields. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious LLDP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code on the affected device and cause LLDP to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\n- CVE-2022-20385: a function called 'nla_parse', do not check the len of para, it will check nla_type (which can be controlled by userspace) with 'maxtype' (in this case, it is GSCAN_MAX), then it access polciy array 'policy[type]', which OOB access happens.Product: AndroidVersions: Android SoCAndroid ID: A-238379819\n\n- CVE-2022-26125: Buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in FRRouting through 8.1.0 due to wrong checks on the input packet length in isisd/isis_tlvs.c.\n\n- CVE-2022-26127: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in FRRouting through 8.1.0 due to missing a check on the input packet length in the babel_packet_examin function in babeld/message.c.\n\n- CVE-2022-26128: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in FRRouting through 8.1.0 due to a wrong check on the input packet length in the babel_packet_examin function in babeld/message.c.\n\n- CVE-2022-36086: linked_list_allocator is an allocator usable for no_std systems. Prior to version 0.10.2, the heap initialization methods were missing a minimum size check for the given heap size argument. This could lead to out-of-bound writes when a heap was initialized with a size smaller than `3 * size_of::<usize>` because of metadata write operations. This vulnerability impacts all the initialization functions on the `Heap` and `LockedHeap` types, including `Heap::new`, `Heap::init`, `Heap::init_from_slice`, and `LockedHeap::new`. It also affects multiple uses of the `Heap::extend` method. Version 0.10.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, ensure that the heap is only initialized with a size larger than `3 * size_of::<usize>` and that the `Heap::extend` method is only called with sizes larger than `2 * size_of::<usize>()`. Also, ensure that the total heap size is (and stays) a multiple of `2 * size_of::<usize>()`.\n\n- CVE-2022-36938: DexLoader function get_stringidx_fromdex() in Redex prior to commit 3b44c64 can load an out of bound address when loading the string index table, potentially allowing remote code execution during processing of a 3rd party Android APK file.\n\n- CVE-2021-1058: NVIDIA vGPU software contains a vulnerability in the guest kernel mode driver and vGPU plugin, in which an input data size is not validated, which may lead to tampering of data or denial of service.

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/maxpooling_op.cc) misses some validation for the `orig_input` and `orig_output` tensors. The fixes for CVE-2021-29579 were incomplete. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 136b51f10903e044308cf77117c0ed9871350475. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-37677: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the shape inference code for `tf.raw_ops.Dequantize` has a vulnerability that could trigger a denial of service via a segfault if an attacker provides invalid arguments. The shape inference [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/ops/array_ops.cc#L2999-L3014) uses `axis` to select between two different values for `minmax_rank` which is then used to retrieve tensor dimensions. However, code assumes that `axis` can be either `-1` or a value greater than `-1`, with no validation for the other values. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit da857cfa0fde8f79ad0afdbc94e88b5d4bbec764. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-39193: Frontier is Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer. Prior to commit number 0b962f218f0cdd796dadfe26c3f09e68f7861b26, a bug in `pallet-ethereum` can cause invalid transactions to be included in the Ethereum block state in `pallet-ethereum` due to not validating the input data size. Any invalid transactions included this way have no possibility to alter the internal Ethereum or Substrate state. The transaction will appear to have be included, but is of no effect as it is rejected by the EVM engine. The impact is further limited by Substrate extrinsic size constraints. A patch is available in commit number 0b962f218f0cdd796dadfe26c3f09e68f7861b26. There are no workarounds aside from applying the patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-39690: In setDisplayPadding of WallpaperManagerService.java, there is a possible way to cause a persistent DoS due to improper input validation.

This crash affects the availability of the software and dependent downstream components.\n\n- CVE-2022-23580: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. During shape inference, TensorFlow can allocate a large vector based on a value from a tensor controlled by the user. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-29202: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.ragged.constant` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a denial of service by consuming all available memory. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36078: Binary provides encoding/decoding in Borsh and other formats. The vulnerability is a memory allocation vulnerability that can be exploited to allocate slices in memory with (arbitrary) excessive size value, which can either exhaust available memory or crash the whole program. When using `github.com/gagliardetto/binary` to parse unchecked (or wrong type of) data from untrusted sources of input (e.g. the blockchain) into slices, it's possible to allocate memory with excessive size. When `dec.Decode(&val)` method is used to parse data into a structure that is or contains slices of values, the length of the slice was previously read directly from the data itself without any checks on the size of it, and then a slice was allocated. This could lead to an overflow and an allocation of memory with excessive size value. Users should upgrade to `v0.7.1` or higher. A workaround is not to rely on the `dec.Decode(&val)` function to parse the data, but to use a custom `UnmarshalWithDecoder()` method that reads and checks the length of any slice.\n\n- CVE-2022-37311: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large location request parameter to the redirect servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-37312: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large request body containing a redirect URL to the deferrer servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-39294: conduit-hyper integrates a conduit application with the hyper server. Prior to version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` did not check any limit on a request's length before calling [`hyper::body::to_bytes`](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/body/fn.to_bytes.html). An attacker could send a malicious request with an abnormally large `Content-Length`, which could lead to a panic if memory allocation failed for that request. In version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` sets an internal limit of 128 MiB per request, otherwise returning status 400 (\"Bad Request\"). This crate is part of the implementation of Rust's [crates.io](https://crates.io/), but that service is not affected due to its existing cloud infrastructure, which already drops such malicious requests. Even with the new limit in place, `conduit-hyper` is not recommended for production use, nor to directly serve the public Internet.\n\n- CVE-2022-4111: Unrestricted file size limit can lead to DoS in tooljet/tooljet <1.27 by allowing a logged in attacker to upload profile pictures over 2MB. \n\n- CVE-2022-41968: Nextcloud Server is an open source personal cloud server.

This vulnerability is due to missing length validation of certain Cisco Discovery Protocol packet header fields. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to exhaust available memory and cause the service to restart. Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability. \n\n- CVE-2022-21208: The package node-opcua before 2.74.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to a missing limitation on the number of received chunks - per single session or in total for all concurrent sessions. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending an unlimited number of huge chunks (e.g. 2GB each) without sending the Final closing chunk.\n\n- CVE-2022-29212: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, certain TFLite models that were created using TFLite model converter would crash when loaded in the TFLite interpreter. The culprit is that during quantization the scale of values could be greater than 1 but code was always assuming sub-unit scaling. Thus, since code was calling `QuantizeMultiplierSmallerThanOneExp`, the `TFLITE_CHECK_LT` assertion would trigger and abort the process. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29196: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackpropFilterV2` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate that the `filter_sizes` argument is a vector. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29200: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.LSTMBlockCell` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate the ranks of any of the arguments to this API call. This results in `CHECK`-failures when the elements of the tensor are accessed. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-789 (CanPrecede)",

This vulnerability has been patched in version 0.9.18.1 and above. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-39293: Azure RTOS USBX is a high-performance USB host, device, and on-the-go (OTG) embedded stack, that is fully integrated with Azure RTOS ThreadX. The case is, in [_ux_host_class_pima_read](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/master/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c), there is data length from device response, returned in the very first packet, and read by [L165 code](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L165), as header_length. Then in [L178 code](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L178), there is a \u201cif\u201d branch, which check the expression of \u201c(header_length - UX_HOST_CLASS_PIMA_DATA_HEADER_SIZE) > data_length\u201d where if header_length is smaller than UX_HOST_CLASS_PIMA_DATA_HEADER_SIZE, calculation could overflow and then [L182 code](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L182) the calculation of data_length is also overflow, this way the later [while loop start from L192](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L192) can move data_pointer to unexpected address and cause write buffer overflow.

An attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedResizeBilinear` by manipulating input values so that float rounding results in off-by-one error in accessing image elements. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/44b7f486c0143f68b56c34e2d01e146ee445134a/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_resize_bilinear_op.cc#L62-L66) computes two integers (representing the upper and lower bounds for interpolation) by ceiling and flooring a floating point value. For some values of `in`, `interpolation->upper[i]` might be smaller than `interpolation->lower[i]`. This is an issue if `interpolation->upper[i]` is capped at `in_size-1` as it means that `interpolation->lower[i]` points outside of the image. Then, in the interpolation code(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/44b7f486c0143f68b56c34e2d01e146ee445134a/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_resize_bilinear_op.cc#L245-L264), this would result in heap buffer overflow. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-3156: Sudo before 1.9.5p2 contains an off-by-one error that can result in a heap-based buffer overflow, which allows privilege escalation to root via \"sudoedit -s\" and a command-line argument that ends with a single backslash character.\n\n- CVE-2021-31875: In mjs_json.c in Cesanta MongooseOS mJS 1.26, a maliciously formed JSON string can trigger an off-by-one heap-based buffer overflow in mjs_json_parse, which can potentially lead to redirection of control flow. NOTE: the original reporter disputes the significance of this finding because \"there isn\u2019t very much of an opportunity to exploit this reliably for an information leak, so there isn\u2019t any real security impact.\"\n\n- CVE-2021-37164: A buffer overflow issue was discovered in HMI3 Control Panel in Swisslog Healthcare Nexus Panel operated by released versions of software before Nexus Software 7.2.5.7. In the tcpTxThread function, the received data is copied to a stack buffer. An off-by-3 condition can occur, resulting in a stack-based buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2020-27171: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. kernel/bpf/verifier.c has an off-by-one error (with a resultant integer underflow) affecting out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic, leading to side-channel attacks that defeat Spectre mitigations and obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, aka CID-10d2bb2e6b1d.\n\n- CVE-2021-21118: Insufficient data validation in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 88.0.4324.96 allowed a remote attacker to potentially perform out of bounds memory access via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-21938: A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Palette box parser functionality of Accusoft ImageGear 19.10. A specially-crafted file can lead to code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-3999: A flaw was found in glibc. An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd() may lead to memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. A local attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd() in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.\n\n- CVE-2021-46848: GNU Libtasn1 before 4.19.0 has an ETYPE_OK off-by-one array size check that affects asn1_encode_simple_der.\n\n- CVE-2022-34970: Crow before 1.0+4 has a heap-based buffer overflow via the function qs_parse in query_string.h. On successful exploitation this vulnerability allows attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code in the context of the vulnerable service.\n\n- CVE-2022-3821: An off-by-one Error issue was discovered in Systemd in format_timespan() function of time-util.c. An attacker could supply specific values for time and accuracy that leads to buffer overrun in format_timespan(), leading to a Denial of Service.\n\n- CVE-2022-39274: LoRaMac-node is a reference implementation and documentation of a LoRa network node. Versions of LoRaMac-node prior to 4.7.0 are vulnerable to a buffer overflow. Improper size validation of the incoming radio frames can lead to an 65280-byte out-of-bounds write. The function `ProcessRadioRxDone` implicitly expects incoming radio frames to have at least a payload of one byte or more. An empty payload leads to a 1-byte out-of-bounds read of user controlled content when the payload buffer is reused. This allows an attacker to craft a FRAME_TYPE_PROPRIETARY frame with size -1 which results in an 65280-byte out-of-bounds memcopy likely with partially controlled attacker data. Corrupting a large part if the data section is likely to cause a DoS. If the large out-of-bounds write does not immediately crash the attacker may gain control over the execution due to now controlling large parts of the data section. Users are advised to upgrade either by updating their package or by manually applying the patch commit `e851b079`.\n\n- CVE-2022-47517: An issue was discovered in the libsofia-sip fork in drachtio-server before 0.8.19. It allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a crafted UDP message that causes a url_canonize2 heap-based buffer over-read because of an off-by-one error.\n\n- CVE-2022-36354: A heap out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the RLA format parser of OpenImageIO master-branch-9aeece7a and v2.3.19.0. More specifically, in the way run-length encoded byte spans are handled. A malformed RLA file can lead to an out-of-bounds read of heap metadata which can result in sensitive information leak. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-24988: In galois_2p8 before 0.1.2, PrimitivePolynomialField::new has an off-by-one buffer overflow for a vector.\n\n- CVE-2022-41916: Heimdal is an implementation of ASN.1/DER, PKIX, and Kerberos. Versions prior to 7.7.1 are vulnerable to a denial of service vulnerability in Heimdal's PKI certificate validation library, affecting the KDC (via PKINIT) and kinit (via PKINIT), as well as any third-party applications using Heimdal's libhx509.

Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the \"out\" parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the \"outlen\" parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the \"out\" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k).\n\n- CVE-2021-27378: An issue was discovered in the rand_core crate before 0.6.2 for Rust.

If the `splits` argument of `RaggedBincount` does not specify a valid `SparseTensor`(https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/sparse/SparseTensor), then an attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow. This will cause a read from outside the bounds of the `splits` tensor buffer in the implementation of the `RaggedBincount` op(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8b677d79167799f71c42fd3fa074476e0295413a/tensorflow/core/kernels/bincount_op.cc#L430-L433). Before the `for` loop, `batch_idx` is set to 0. The user controls the `splits` array, making it contain only one element, 0. Thus, the code in the `while` loop would increment `batch_idx` and then try to read `splits(1)`, which is outside of bounds. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2 and TensorFlow 2.3.3, as these are also affected.\n\n- CVE-2021-29514: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. If the `splits` argument of `RaggedBincount` does not specify a valid `SparseTensor`(https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/sparse/SparseTensor), then an attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow. This will cause a read from outside the bounds of the `splits` tensor buffer in the implementation of the `RaggedBincount` op(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8b677d79167799f71c42fd3fa074476e0295413a/tensorflow/core/kernels/bincount_op.cc#L430-L446). Before the `for` loop, `batch_idx` is set to 0. The attacker sets `splits(0)` to be 7, hence the `while` loop does not execute and `batch_idx` remains 0. This then results in writing to `out(-1, bin)`, which is before the heap allocated buffer for the output tensor. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2 and TensorFlow 2.3.3, as these are also affected.\n\n- CVE-2021-29520: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.

Later, when reading/writing to this buffer, code uses the value computed here, instead of the number of elements in the tensor. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29542: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow by passing crafted inputs to `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams`.

The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.MaxPool3DGradGrad` is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/596c05a159b6fbb9e39ca10b3f7753b7244fa1e9/tensorflow/core/kernels/pooling_ops_3d.cc#L694-L696) does not check that the initialization of `Pool3dParameters` completes successfully. Since the constructor(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/596c05a159b6fbb9e39ca10b3f7753b7244fa1e9/tensorflow/core/kernels/pooling_ops_3d.cc#L48-L88) uses `OP_REQUIRES` to validate conditions, the first assertion that fails interrupts the initialization of `params`, making it contain invalid data. In turn, this might cause a heap buffer overflow, depending on default initialized values. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29577: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.

The SSH protocol keeps track of two shared secrets during the lifetime of the session. One of them is called secret_hash and the other session_id. Initially, both of them are the same, but after key re-exchange, previous session_id is kept and used as an input to new secret_hash. Historically, both of these buffers had shared length variable, which worked as long as these buffers were same. But the key re-exchange operation can also change the key exchange method, which can be based on hash of different size, eventually creating \"secret_hash\" of different size than the session_id has. This becomes an issue when the session_id memory is zeroed or when it is used again during second key re-exchange.\n\n- CVE-2021-36530: ngiflib 0.4 has a heap overflow in GetByteStr() at ngiflib.c:108 in NGIFLIB_NO_FILE mode, GetByteStr() copy memory buffer without checking the boundary.\n\n- CVE-2021-36531: ngiflib 0.4 has a heap overflow in GetByte() at ngiflib.c:70 in NGIFLIB_NO_FILE mode, GetByte() reads memory buffer without checking the boundary.\n\n- CVE-2021-36584: An issue was discovered in GPAC 1.0.1.

In version 2.8.0, the `TensorKey` hash function used total estimated `AllocatedBytes()`, which (a) is an estimate per tensor, and (b) is a very poor hash function for constants (e.g. `int32_t`). It also tried to access individual tensor bytes through `tensor.data()` of size `AllocatedBytes()`. This led to ASAN failures because the `AllocatedBytes()` is an estimate of total bytes allocated by a tensor, including any pointed-to constructs (e.g. strings), and does not refer to contiguous bytes in the `.data()` buffer. The discoverers could not use this byte vector anyway because types such as `tstring` include pointers, whereas they needed to hash the string values themselves. This issue is patched in Tensorflow versions 2.9.0 and 2.8.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-2991: A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the Linux kernel's LightNVM subsystem.

The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNorm` is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. If the tensors are empty, the same implementation can trigger undefined behavior by dereferencing null pointers. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/57d86e0db5d1365f19adcce848dfc1bf89fdd4c7/tensorflow/core/kernels/fused_batch_norm_op.cc) fails to validate that `scale`, `offset`, `mean` and `variance` (the last two only when required) all have the same number of elements as the number of channels of `x`. This results in heap out of bounds reads when the buffers backing these tensors are indexed past their boundary. If the tensors are empty, the validation mentioned in the above paragraph would also trigger and prevent the undefined behavior. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29988: Firefox incorrectly treated an inline list-item element as a block element, resulting in an out of bounds read or memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

The function ezxml_parse_str() performs incorrect memory handling while parsing crafted XML files (out-of-bounds read after a certain strcspn failure).\n\n- CVE-2021-32761: Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. A vulnerability involving out-of-bounds read and integer overflow to buffer overflow exists starting with version 2.2 and prior to versions 5.0.13, 6.0.15, and 6.2.5. On 32-bit systems, Redis `*BIT*` command are vulnerable to integer overflow that can potentially be exploited to corrupt the heap, leak arbitrary heap contents or trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter to a very large value and constructing specially crafted commands bit commands. This problem only affects Redis on 32-bit platforms, or compiled as a 32-bit binary. Redis versions 5.0.`3m 6.0.15, and 6.2.5 contain patches for this issue. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the `redis-server` executable is to prevent users from modifying the `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.\n\n- CVE-2021-3409: The patch for CVE-2020-17380/CVE-2020-25085 was found to be ineffective, thus making QEMU vulnerable to the out-of-bounds read/write access issues previously found in the SDHCI controller emulation code. This flaw allows a malicious privileged guest to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service or potential code execution. QEMU up to (including) 5.2.0 is affected by this.\n\n- CVE-2021-3517: There is a flaw in the xml entity encoding functionality of libxml2 in versions before 2.9.11. An attacker who is able to supply a crafted file to be processed by an application linked with the affected functionality of libxml2 could trigger an out-of-bounds read. The most likely impact of this flaw is to application availability, with some potential impact to confidentiality and integrity if an attacker is able to use memory information to further exploit the application.\n\n- CVE-2021-3712: ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit.

Prior to version 2.0.2, there is a bug in Wasmtime's implementation of its pooling instance allocator when the allocator is configured to give WebAssembly instances a maximum of zero pages of memory. In this configuration, the virtual memory mapping for WebAssembly memories did not meet the compiler-required configuration requirements for safely executing WebAssembly modules. Wasmtime's default settings require virtual memory page faults to indicate that wasm reads/writes are out-of-bounds, but the pooling allocator's configuration would not create an appropriate virtual memory mapping for this meaning out of bounds reads/writes can successfully read/write memory unrelated to the wasm sandbox within range of the base address of the memory mapping created by the pooling allocator. This bug is not applicable with the default settings of the `wasmtime` crate. This bug can only be triggered by setting `InstanceLimits::memory_pages` to zero. This is expected to be a very rare configuration since this means that wasm modules cannot allocate any pages of linear memory. All wasm modules produced by all current toolchains are highly likely to use linear memory, so it's expected to be unlikely that this configuration is set to zero by any production embedding of Wasmtime. This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2. This bug can be worked around by increasing the `memory_pages` allotment when configuring the pooling allocator to a value greater than zero. If an embedding wishes to still prevent memory from actually being used then the `Store::limiter` method can be used to dynamically disallow growth of memory beyond 0 bytes large. Note that the default `memory_pages` value is greater than zero.\n\n- CVE-2022-41902: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The function MakeGrapplerFunctionItem takes arguments that determine the sizes of inputs and outputs. If the inputs given are greater than or equal to the sizes of the outputs, an out-of-bounds memory read or a crash is triggered. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit a65411a1d69edfb16b25907ffb8f73556ce36bb7. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.8.4, 2.9.3, and 2.10.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-41981: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the TGA file format parser of OpenImageIO v2.3.19.0. A specially-crafted targa file can lead to out of bounds read and write on the process stack, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-4203: A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. In theory it could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext) although we are not aware of any working exploit leading to memory contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects. \n\n- CVE-2022-48303: GNU Tar through 1.34 has a one-byte out-of-bounds read that results in use of uninitialized memory for a conditional jump.

This will allow an attacker to send a NEWSCAN request to a listening agent on the network as well as receive the agent's HTTP request verifying its authtoken. In AEAgent.cpp, the agent responding back over HTTP is vulnerable to a Heap Overflow if the POST payload response is too large. The POST payload response is converted to Unicode using vswprintf. This is written to a buffer only 0x2000 bytes big. If POST payload is larger, then heap overflow will occur.\n\n- CVE-2021-20110: Due to Manage Engine Asset Explorer Agent 1.0.34 not validating HTTPS certificates, an attacker on the network can statically configure their IP address to match the Asset Explorer's Server IP address. This will allow an attacker to send a NEWSCAN request to a listening agent on the network as well as receive the agent's HTTP request verifying its authtoken. In httphandler.cpp, the agent reaching out over HTTP is vulnerable to an Integer Overflow, which can be turned into a Heap Overflow allowing for remote code execution as NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM on the agent machine. The Integer Overflow occurs when receiving POST response from the Manage Engine server, and the agent calling \"HttpQueryInfoW\" in order to get the \"Content-Length\" size from the incoming POST request. This size is taken, but multiplied to a larger amount. If an attacker specifies a Content-Length size of 1073741823 or larger, this integer arithmetic will wrap the value back around to smaller integer, then calls \"calloc\" with this size to allocate memory. The following API \"InternetReadFile\" will copy the POST data into this buffer, which will be too small for the contents, and cause heap overflow.\n\n- CVE-2021-32728: The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud Server with a computer. Clients using the Nextcloud end-to-end encryption feature download the public and private key via an API endpoint. In versions prior to 3.3.0, the Nextcloud Desktop client fails to check if a private key belongs to previously downloaded public certificate. If the Nextcloud instance serves a malicious public key, the data would be encrypted for this key and thus could be accessible to a malicious actor. This issue is fixed in Nextcloud Desktop Client version 3.3.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.\n\n- CVE-2021-20327: A specific version of the Node.js mongodb-client-encryption module does not perform correct validation of the KMS server\u2019s certificate. This vulnerability in combination with a privileged network position active MITM attack could result in interception of traffic between the Node.js driver and the KMS service rendering client-side field level encryption (CSFLE) ineffective. This issue was discovered during internal testing and affects mongodb-client-encryption module version 1.2.0, which was available from 2021-Jan-29 and deprecated in the NPM Registry on 2021-Feb-04. This vulnerability does not impact driver traffic payloads with CSFLE-supported key services from applications residing inside the AWS, GCP, and Azure nework fabrics due to compensating controls in these environments. This issue does not impact driver workloads that don\u2019t use Field Level Encryption. This issue affect MongoDB Node.js Driver mongodb-client-encryption module version 1.2.0 \n\n- CVE-2021-20732: The ATOM (ATOM - Smart life App for Android versions prior to 1.8.1 and ATOM - Smart life App for iOS versions prior to 1.8.2) does not verify server certificate properly, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to eavesdrop on encrypted communication via a crafted certificate.\n\n- CVE-2021-20833: The SNKRDUNK Market Place App for iOS versions prior to 2.2.0 does not verify server certificate properly, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to eavesdrop on and/or alter encrypted communication via a crafted certificate.\n\n- CVE-2021-21559: Dell EMC NetWorker, versions 18.x, 19.1.x, 19.2.x 19.3.x, 19.4, and 19.4.0.1 contain an Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in the client (NetWorker Management Console) components which uses SSL encrypted connection in order to communicate with the application server. An unauthenticated attacker in the same network collision domain as the NetWorker Management Console client could potentially exploit this vulnerability to perform man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept and tamper the traffic between the client and the application server.\n\n- CVE-2021-32727: Nextcloud Android Client is the Android client for Nextcloud. Clients using the Nextcloud end-to-end encryption feature download the public and private key via an API endpoint. In versions prior to 3.16.1, the Nextcloud Android client skipped a step that involved the client checking if a private key belonged to a previously downloaded public certificate. If the Nextcloud instance served a malicious public key, the data would be encrypted for this key and thus could be accessible to a malicious actor. The vulnerability is patched in version 3.16.1.

Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-287 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-287 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-322 (PeerOf)",

The binary is usually named wscd or mini_upnpd and is the successor to miniigd. The server is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow vulnerability that is present due to unsafe parsing of the UPnP SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE Callback header. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows remote unauthenticated attackers to gain arbitrary code execution on the affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-35395: Realtek Jungle SDK version v2.x up to v3.4.14B provides an HTTP web server exposing a management interface that can be used to configure the access point. Two versions of this management interface exists: one based on Go-Ahead named webs and another based on Boa named boa. Both of them are affected by these vulnerabilities. Specifically, these binaries are vulnerable to the following issues: - stack buffer overflow in formRebootCheck due to unsafe copy of submit-url parameter - stack buffer overflow in formWsc due to unsafe copy of submit-url parameter - stack buffer overflow in formWlanMultipleAP due to unsafe copy of submit-url parameter - stack buffer overflow in formWlSiteSurvey due to unsafe copy of ifname parameter - stack buffer overflow in formStaticDHCP due to unsafe copy of hostname parameter - stack buffer overflow in formWsc due to unsafe copy of 'peerPin' parameter - arbitrary command execution in formSysCmd via the sysCmd parameter - arbitrary command injection in formWsc via the 'peerPin' parameter Exploitability of identified issues will differ based on what the end vendor/manufacturer did with the Realtek SDK webserver. Some vendors use it as-is, others add their own authentication implementation, some kept all the features from the server, some remove some of them, some inserted their own set of features. However, given that Realtek SDK implementation is full of insecure calls and that developers tends to re-use those examples in their custom code, any binary based on Realtek SDK webserver will probably contains its own set of issues on top of the Realtek ones (if kept). Successful exploitation of these issues allows remote attackers to gain arbitrary code execution on the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-35474: Stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in cachekey plugin of Apache Traffic Server.

From inspection it is clear that the defect is also present in releases from those series, but they have not been officially tested for the vulnerability), The outcome of encountering the defect while reading a lease that will trigger it varies, according to: the component being affected (i.e., dhclient or dhcpd) whether the package was built as a 32-bit or 64-bit binary whether the compiler flag -fstack-protection-strong was used when compiling In dhclient, ISC has not successfully reproduced the error on a 64-bit system. However, on a 32-bit system it is possible to cause dhclient to crash when reading an improper lease, which could cause network connectivity problems for an affected system due to the absence of a running DHCP client process. In dhcpd, when run in DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 mode: if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 32-bit architecture AND the -fstack-protection-strong flag was specified to the compiler, dhcpd may exit while parsing a lease file containing an objectionable lease, resulting in lack of service to clients. Additionally, the offending lease and the lease immediately following it in the lease database may be improperly deleted. if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 64-bit architecture OR if the -fstack-protection-strong compiler flag was NOT specified, the crash will not occur, but it is possible for the offending lease and the lease which immediately followed it to be improperly deleted.\n\n- CVE-2020-14107: A stack overflow in the HTTP server of Cast can be exploited to make the app crash in LAN.\n\n- CVE-2021-38427: RTI Connext DDS Professional and Connext DDS Secure Versions 4.2.x to 6.1.0 are vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, which may allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-42529: XMP Toolkit SDK version 2021.07 (and earlier) is affected by a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.

Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may be further mitigated based on stack layout for any given platform/compiler. Pre-announcements of CVE-2022-3602 described this issue as CRITICAL. Further analysis based on some of the mitigating factors described above have led this to be downgraded to HIGH. Users are still encouraged to upgrade to a new version as soon as possible.

The implementation of `tf.io.decode_raw` produces incorrect results and crashes the Python interpreter when combining `fixed_length` and wider datatypes. The implementation of the padded version(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc) is buggy due to a confusion about pointer arithmetic rules. First, the code computes(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L61) the width of each output element by dividing the `fixed_length` value to the size of the type argument. The `fixed_length` argument is also used to determine the size needed for the output tensor(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L63-L79). This is followed by reencoding code(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L85-L94). The erroneous code is the last line above: it is moving the `out_data` pointer by `fixed_length * sizeof(T)` bytes whereas it only copied at most `fixed_length` bytes from the input. This results in parts of the input not being decoded into the output. Furthermore, because the pointer advance is far wider than desired, this quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data. This OOB write leads to interpreter crash in the reproducer mentioned here, but more severe attacks can be mounted too, given that this gadget allows writing to periodically placed locations in memory. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29947: Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 87.

This value may be required as an index into a buffer, a loop iterator, or simply necessary state data. In any case, the value cannot be trusted and the system will be in an undefined state. While this method may be employed viably to isolate the low bits of a value, this usage is rare, and truncation usually implies that an implementation error has occurred.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-17087: Chain: integer truncation (CWE-197) causes small buffer allocation (CWE-131) leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) in kernel pool, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2009-0231: Integer truncation of length value leads to heap-based buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2008-3282: Size of a particular type changes for 64-bit platforms, leading to an integer truncation in document processor causes incorrect index to be generated.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-21859: An exploitable integer truncation vulnerability exists within the MPEG-4 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library v1.0.1. The stri_box_read function is used when processing atoms using the 'stri' FOURCC code. An attacker can convince a user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-21860: An exploitable integer truncation vulnerability exists within the MPEG-4 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library v1.0.1. A specially crafted MPEG-4 input can cause an improper memory allocation resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory corruption. The FOURCC code, 'trik', is parsed by the function within the library. An attacker can convince a user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-21861: An exploitable integer truncation vulnerability exists within the MPEG-4 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library v1.0.1.

Versions prior to 4.9 are vulnerable to an Out-of-bounds read. While processing the L2CAP protocol, the Bluetooth Low Energy stack of Contiki-NG needs to map an incoming channel ID to its metadata structure. While looking up the corresponding channel structure in get_channel_for_cid (in os/net/mac/ble/ble-l2cap.c), a bounds check is performed on the incoming channel ID, which is meant to ensure that the channel ID does not exceed the maximum number of supported channels.However, an integer truncation issue leads to only the lowest byte of the channel ID to be checked, which leads to an incomplete out-of-bounds check. A crafted channel ID leads to out-of-bounds memory to be read and written with attacker-controlled data. The vulnerability has been patched in the \"develop\" branch of Contiki-NG, and will be included in release 4.9. As a workaround, Users can apply the patch in Contiki-NG pull request 2081 on GitHub.\n\n- CVE-2022-42324: Oxenstored 32->31 bit integer truncation issues Integers in Ocaml are 63 or 31 bits of signed precision. The Ocaml Xenbus library takes a C uint32_t out of the ring and casts it directly to an Ocaml integer. In 64-bit Ocaml builds this is fine, but in 32-bit builds, it truncates off the most significant bit, and then creates unsigned/signed confusion in the remainder. This in turn can feed a negative value into logic not expecting a negative value, resulting in unexpected exceptions being thrown. The unexpected exception is not handled suitably, creating a busy-loop trying (and failing) to take the bad packet out of the xenstore ring.\n\n- CVE-2022-34169: The Apache Xalan Java XSLT library is vulnerable to an integer truncation issue when processing malicious XSLT stylesheets. This can be used to corrupt Java class files generated by the internal XSLTC compiler and execute arbitrary Java bytecode. Users are recommended to update to version 2.7.3 or later. Note: Java runtimes (such as OpenJDK) include repackaged copies of Xalan.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-681 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-681 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-681 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-195 (CanAlsoBe)\n\n- CWE-196 (CanAlsoBe)\n\n- CWE-192 (CanAlsoBe)\n\n- CWE-194 (CanAlsoBe)",

Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-21668: Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n\n- CVE-2008-1440: lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop\n\n- CVE-2008-2374: lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-31401: An issue was discovered in tcp_rcv() in nptcp.c in HCC embedded InterNiche 4.0.1. The TCP header processing code doesn't sanitize the value of the IP total length field (header length + data length). With a crafted IP packet, an integer overflow occurs whenever the value of the IP data length is calculated by subtracting the length of the header from the total length of the IP packet.\n\n- CVE-2021-31802: NETGEAR R7000 1.0.11.116 devices have a heap-based Buffer Overflow that is exploitable from the local network without authentication. The vulnerability exists within the handling of an HTTP request. An attacker can leverage this to execute code as root. The problem is that a user-provided length value is trusted during a backup.cgi file upload. The attacker must add a \\\\n before the Content-Length header.\n\n- CVE-2021-37663: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions due to incomplete validation in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeV2`, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/84d053187cb80d975ef2b9684d4b61981bca0c41/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_op.cc#L59) has some validation but does not check that `min_range` and `max_range` both have the same non-zero number of elements. If `axis` is provided (i.e., not `-1`), then validation should check that it is a value in range for the rank of `input` tensor and then the lengths of `min_range` and `max_range` inputs match the `axis` dimension of the `input` tensor. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 6da6620efad397c85493b8f8667b821403516708. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-37665: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions due to incomplete validation in MKL implementation of requantization, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/mkl/mkl_requantization_range_per_channel_op.cc) does not validate the dimensions of the `input` tensor. A similar issue occurs in `MklRequantizePerChannelOp`. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/mkl/mkl_requantize_per_channel_op.cc) does not perform full validation for all the input arguments. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 9e62869465573cb2d9b5053f1fa02a81fce21d69 and in the Github commit 203214568f5bc237603dbab6e1fd389f1572f5c9. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-3655: A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in versions prior to v5.14-rc1. Missing size validations on inbound SCTP packets may allow the kernel to read uninitialized memory.\n\n- CVE-2021-21404: Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program. In Syncthing before version 1.15.0, the relay server `strelaysrv` can be caused to crash and exit by sending a relay message with a negative length field. Similarly, Syncthing itself can crash for the same reason if given a malformed message from a malicious relay server when attempting to join the relay. Relay joins are essentially random (from a subset of low latency relays) and Syncthing will by default restart when crashing, at which point it's likely to pick another non-malicious relay.

Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-25727: Memory Corruption in modem due to improper length check while copying into memory in Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Voice & Music\n\n- CVE-2022-25793: A Stack-based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in Autodesk 3ds Max 2022, 2021, and 2020 may lead to code execution through the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer when parsing ActionScript Byte Code files.

Azure RTOS USBX implementation of host support for USB CDC ECM includes an integer underflow and a buffer overflow in the `_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function which may be potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution or denial of service. Setting mac address string descriptor length to a `0` or `1` allows an attacker to introduce an integer underflow followed (string_length) by a buffer overflow of the `cdc_ecm -> ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id` array. This may allow one to redirect the code execution flow or introduce a denial of service. The fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel). Improved mac address string descriptor length validation to check for unexpectedly small values may be used as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-36620: D-link DIR-816 A2_v1.10CNB04, DIR-878 DIR_878_FW1.30B08.img is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via /goform/addRouting.\n\n- CVE-2022-37134: D-link DIR-816 A2_v1.10CNB04.img is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via /goform/form2Wan.cgi.

In affected versions the Istio control plane, `istiod`, is vulnerable to a request processing error, allowing a malicious attacker that sends a specially crafted message which results in the control plane crashing. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15012, but does not require any authentication from the attacker. For simple installations, Istiod is typically only reachable from within the cluster, limiting the blast radius. However, for some deployments, especially [multicluster](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/multicluster/primary-remote/) topologies, this port is exposed over the public internet. There are no effective workarounds, beyond upgrading. Limiting network access to Istiod to the minimal set of clients can help lessen the scope of the vulnerability to some extent.\n\n- CVE-2021-31556: An issue was discovered in the Oauth extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2.

A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code on the affected device and cause LLDP to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\n- CVE-2022-20385: a function called 'nla_parse', do not check the len of para, it will check nla_type (which can be controlled by userspace) with 'maxtype' (in this case, it is GSCAN_MAX), then it access polciy array 'policy[type]', which OOB access happens.Product: AndroidVersions: Android SoCAndroid ID: A-238379819\n\n- CVE-2022-26125: Buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in FRRouting through 8.1.0 due to wrong checks on the input packet length in isisd/isis_tlvs.c.\n\n- CVE-2022-26127: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in FRRouting through 8.1.0 due to missing a check on the input packet length in the babel_packet_examin function in babeld/message.c.\n\n- CVE-2022-26128: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in FRRouting through 8.1.0 due to a wrong check on the input packet length in the babel_packet_examin function in babeld/message.c.\n\n- CVE-2022-36086: linked_list_allocator is an allocator usable for no_std systems. Prior to version 0.10.2, the heap initialization methods were missing a minimum size check for the given heap size argument. This could lead to out-of-bound writes when a heap was initialized with a size smaller than `3 * size_of::<usize>` because of metadata write operations. This vulnerability impacts all the initialization functions on the `Heap` and `LockedHeap` types, including `Heap::new`, `Heap::init`, `Heap::init_from_slice`, and `LockedHeap::new`. It also affects multiple uses of the `Heap::extend` method. Version 0.10.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, ensure that the heap is only initialized with a size larger than `3 * size_of::<usize>` and that the `Heap::extend` method is only called with sizes larger than `2 * size_of::<usize>()`. Also, ensure that the total heap size is (and stays) a multiple of `2 * size_of::<usize>()`.\n\n- CVE-2022-36938: DexLoader function get_stringidx_fromdex() in Redex prior to commit 3b44c64 can load an out of bound address when loading the string index table, potentially allowing remote code execution during processing of a 3rd party Android APK file.\n\n- CVE-2021-1058: NVIDIA vGPU software contains a vulnerability in the guest kernel mode driver and vGPU plugin, in which an input data size is not validated, which may lead to tampering of data or denial of service.

In affected versions an attacker can trigger a denial of service via a segmentation fault in `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGrad` caused by missing validation. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/maxpooling_op.cc) misses some validation for the `orig_input` and `orig_output` tensors. The fixes for CVE-2021-29579 were incomplete. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 136b51f10903e044308cf77117c0ed9871350475. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-37677: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the shape inference code for `tf.raw_ops.Dequantize` has a vulnerability that could trigger a denial of service via a segfault if an attacker provides invalid arguments. The shape inference [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/ops/array_ops.cc#L2999-L3014) uses `axis` to select between two different values for `minmax_rank` which is then used to retrieve tensor dimensions. However, code assumes that `axis` can be either `-1` or a value greater than `-1`, with no validation for the other values. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit da857cfa0fde8f79ad0afdbc94e88b5d4bbec764. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-39193: Frontier is Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer. Prior to commit number 0b962f218f0cdd796dadfe26c3f09e68f7861b26, a bug in `pallet-ethereum` can cause invalid transactions to be included in the Ethereum block state in `pallet-ethereum` due to not validating the input data size. Any invalid transactions included this way have no possibility to alter the internal Ethereum or Substrate state. The transaction will appear to have be included, but is of no effect as it is rejected by the EVM engine. The impact is further limited by Substrate extrinsic size constraints.

We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-29202: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.ragged.constant` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a denial of service by consuming all available memory. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36078: Binary provides encoding/decoding in Borsh and other formats. The vulnerability is a memory allocation vulnerability that can be exploited to allocate slices in memory with (arbitrary) excessive size value, which can either exhaust available memory or crash the whole program. When using `github.com/gagliardetto/binary` to parse unchecked (or wrong type of) data from untrusted sources of input (e.g. the blockchain) into slices, it's possible to allocate memory with excessive size. When `dec.Decode(&val)` method is used to parse data into a structure that is or contains slices of values, the length of the slice was previously read directly from the data itself without any checks on the size of it, and then a slice was allocated. This could lead to an overflow and an allocation of memory with excessive size value. Users should upgrade to `v0.7.1` or higher. A workaround is not to rely on the `dec.Decode(&val)` function to parse the data, but to use a custom `UnmarshalWithDecoder()` method that reads and checks the length of any slice.\n\n- CVE-2022-37311: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large location request parameter to the redirect servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-37312: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large request body containing a redirect URL to the deferrer servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-39294: conduit-hyper integrates a conduit application with the hyper server. Prior to version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` did not check any limit on a request's length before calling [`hyper::body::to_bytes`](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/body/fn.to_bytes.html). An attacker could send a malicious request with an abnormally large `Content-Length`, which could lead to a panic if memory allocation failed for that request. In version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` sets an internal limit of 128 MiB per request, otherwise returning status 400 (\"Bad Request\"). This crate is part of the implementation of Rust's [crates.io](https://crates.io/), but that service is not affected due to its existing cloud infrastructure, which already drops such malicious requests. Even with the new limit in place, `conduit-hyper` is not recommended for production use, nor to directly serve the public Internet.\n\n- CVE-2022-4111: Unrestricted file size limit can lead to DoS in tooljet/tooljet <1.27 by allowing a logged in attacker to upload profile pictures over 2MB. \n\n- CVE-2022-41968: Nextcloud Server is an open source personal cloud server. Prior to versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.5, calendar name lengths are not validated before writing to a database. As a result, an attacker can send unnecessary amounts of data against the database. Version 23.0.10 and 24.0.5 contain patches for the issue. No known workarounds are available.\n\n- CVE-2022-20488: In NotificationChannel of NotificationChannel.java, there is a possible failure to persist permissions settings due to resource exhaustion. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-12 Android-12L Android-13Android ID: A-242703217\n\n- CVE-2022-20491: In NotificationChannel of NotificationChannel.java, there is a possible failure to persist permissions settings due to resource exhaustion. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-12 Android-12L Android-13Android ID: A-242703556\n\n- CVE-2022-20691: A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol functionality of Cisco ATA 190 Series Adaptive Telephone Adapter firmware could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a DoS condition of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to missing length validation of certain Cisco Discovery Protocol packet header fields. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to exhaust available memory and cause the service to restart. Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability. \n\n- CVE-2022-21208: The package node-opcua before 2.74.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to a missing limitation on the number of received chunks - per single session or in total for all concurrent sessions. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending an unlimited number of huge chunks (e.g. 2GB each) without sending the Final closing chunk.\n\n- CVE-2022-29212: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, certain TFLite models that were created using TFLite model converter would crash when loaded in the TFLite interpreter. The culprit is that during quantization the scale of values could be greater than 1 but code was always assuming sub-unit scaling. Thus, since code was calling `QuantizeMultiplierSmallerThanOneExp`, the `TFLITE_CHECK_LT` assertion would trigger and abort the process. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29196: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackpropFilterV2` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate that the `filter_sizes` argument is a vector. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29200: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.LSTMBlockCell` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate the ranks of any of the arguments to this API call. This results in `CHECK`-failures when the elements of the tensor are accessed. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-789 (CanPrecede)",

When sending an ICMPv6 error message because of invalid extension header options in an incoming IPv6 packet, there is an attempt to remove the RPL extension headers. Because the packet length and the extension header length are unchecked (with respect to the available data) at this stage, and these variables are susceptible to integer underflow, it is possible to construct an invalid extension header that will cause memory corruption issues and lead to a Denial-of-Service condition. This is related to rpl-ext-header.c.\n\n- CVE-2021-3321: Integer Underflow in Zephyr in IEEE 802154 Fragment Reassembly Header Removal. Zephyr versions >= >=2.4.0 contain Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow (CWE-680).

The case is, in [_ux_host_class_pima_read](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/master/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c), there is data length from device response, returned in the very first packet, and read by [L165 code](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L165), as header_length. Then in [L178 code](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L178), there is a \u201cif\u201d branch, which check the expression of \u201c(header_length - UX_HOST_CLASS_PIMA_DATA_HEADER_SIZE) > data_length\u201d where if header_length is smaller than UX_HOST_CLASS_PIMA_DATA_HEADER_SIZE, calculation could overflow and then [L182 code](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L182) the calculation of data_length is also overflow, this way the later [while loop start from L192](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L192) can move data_pointer to unexpected address and cause write buffer overflow.

An attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedResizeBilinear` by manipulating input values so that float rounding results in off-by-one error in accessing image elements. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/44b7f486c0143f68b56c34e2d01e146ee445134a/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_resize_bilinear_op.cc#L62-L66) computes two integers (representing the upper and lower bounds for interpolation) by ceiling and flooring a floating point value. For some values of `in`, `interpolation->upper[i]` might be smaller than `interpolation->lower[i]`. This is an issue if `interpolation->upper[i]` is capped at `in_size-1` as it means that `interpolation->lower[i]` points outside of the image. Then, in the interpolation code(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/44b7f486c0143f68b56c34e2d01e146ee445134a/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_resize_bilinear_op.cc#L245-L264), this would result in heap buffer overflow. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-3156: Sudo before 1.9.5p2 contains an off-by-one error that can result in a heap-based buffer overflow, which allows privilege escalation to root via \"sudoedit -s\" and a command-line argument that ends with a single backslash character.\n\n- CVE-2021-31875: In mjs_json.c in Cesanta MongooseOS mJS 1.26, a maliciously formed JSON string can trigger an off-by-one heap-based buffer overflow in mjs_json_parse, which can potentially lead to redirection of control flow. NOTE: the original reporter disputes the significance of this finding because \"there isn\u2019t very much of an opportunity to exploit this reliably for an information leak, so there isn\u2019t any real security impact.\"\n\n- CVE-2021-37164: A buffer overflow issue was discovered in HMI3 Control Panel in Swisslog Healthcare Nexus Panel operated by released versions of software before Nexus Software 7.2.5.7. In the tcpTxThread function, the received data is copied to a stack buffer. An off-by-3 condition can occur, resulting in a stack-based buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2020-27171: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. kernel/bpf/verifier.c has an off-by-one error (with a resultant integer underflow) affecting out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic, leading to side-channel attacks that defeat Spectre mitigations and obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, aka CID-10d2bb2e6b1d.\n\n- CVE-2021-21118: Insufficient data validation in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 88.0.4324.96 allowed a remote attacker to potentially perform out of bounds memory access via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-21938: A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Palette box parser functionality of Accusoft ImageGear 19.10. A specially-crafted file can lead to code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-3999: A flaw was found in glibc. An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd() may lead to memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. A local attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd() in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.\n\n- CVE-2021-46848: GNU Libtasn1 before 4.19.0 has an ETYPE_OK off-by-one array size check that affects asn1_encode_simple_der.\n\n- CVE-2022-34970: Crow before 1.0+4 has a heap-based buffer overflow via the function qs_parse in query_string.h. On successful exploitation this vulnerability allows attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code in the context of the vulnerable service.\n\n- CVE-2022-3821: An off-by-one Error issue was discovered in Systemd in format_timespan() function of time-util.c. An attacker could supply specific values for time and accuracy that leads to buffer overrun in format_timespan(), leading to a Denial of Service.\n\n- CVE-2022-39274: LoRaMac-node is a reference implementation and documentation of a LoRa network node. Versions of LoRaMac-node prior to 4.7.0 are vulnerable to a buffer overflow. Improper size validation of the incoming radio frames can lead to an 65280-byte out-of-bounds write. The function `ProcessRadioRxDone` implicitly expects incoming radio frames to have at least a payload of one byte or more. An empty payload leads to a 1-byte out-of-bounds read of user controlled content when the payload buffer is reused. This allows an attacker to craft a FRAME_TYPE_PROPRIETARY frame with size -1 which results in an 65280-byte out-of-bounds memcopy likely with partially controlled attacker data. Corrupting a large part if the data section is likely to cause a DoS. If the large out-of-bounds write does not immediately crash the attacker may gain control over the execution due to now controlling large parts of the data section. Users are advised to upgrade either by updating their package or by manually applying the patch commit `e851b079`.\n\n- CVE-2022-47517: An issue was discovered in the libsofia-sip fork in drachtio-server before 0.8.19. It allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a crafted UDP message that causes a url_canonize2 heap-based buffer over-read because of an off-by-one error.\n\n- CVE-2022-36354: A heap out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the RLA format parser of OpenImageIO master-branch-9aeece7a and v2.3.19.0. More specifically, in the way run-length encoded byte spans are handled. A malformed RLA file can lead to an out-of-bounds read of heap metadata which can result in sensitive information leak. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-24988: In galois_2p8 before 0.1.2, PrimitivePolynomialField::new has an off-by-one buffer overflow for a vector.\n\n- CVE-2022-41916: Heimdal is an implementation of ASN.1/DER, PKIX, and Kerberos. Versions prior to 7.7.1 are vulnerable to a denial of service vulnerability in Heimdal's PKI certificate validation library, affecting the KDC (via PKINIT) and kinit (via PKINIT), as well as any third-party applications using Heimdal's libhx509. Users should upgrade to Heimdal 7.7.1 or 7.8. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-30155: Windows Kernel Denial of Service Vulnerability\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-682 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-682 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-617 (CanPrecede)\n\n- CWE-170 (CanPrecede)\n\n- CWE-119 (CanPrecede)",

Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the \"out\" parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the \"outlen\" parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the \"out\" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k).\n\n- CVE-2021-27378: An issue was discovered in the rand_core crate before 0.6.2 for Rust. Because read_u32_into and read_u64_into mishandle certain buffer-length checks, a random number generator may be seeded with too little data.\n\n- CVE-2021-28039: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 5.9.x through 5.11.3, as used with Xen. In some less-common configurations, an x86 PV guest OS user can crash a Dom0 or driver domain via a large amount of I/O activity. The issue relates to misuse of guest physical addresses when a configuration has CONFIG_XEN_UNPOPULATED_ALLOC but not CONFIG_XEN_BALLOON_MEMORY_HOTPLUG.\n\n- CVE-2021-40027: The bone voice ID TA has a vulnerability in calculating the buffer length,Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect data confidentiality. \n\n- CVE-2021-38423: All versions of GurumDDS improperly calculate the size to be used when allocating the buffer, which may result in a buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2021-38435: RTI Connext DDS Professional and Connext DDS Secure Versions 4.2x to 6.1.0 not correctly calculate the size when allocating the buffer, which may result in a buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2021-1647: Microsoft Defender Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-21776: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the SGI Format Buffer Size Processing functionality of Accusoft ImageGear 19.8.

The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4.\n\n- CVE-2021-29512: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. If the `splits` argument of `RaggedBincount` does not specify a valid `SparseTensor`(https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/sparse/SparseTensor), then an attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow. This will cause a read from outside the bounds of the `splits` tensor buffer in the implementation of the `RaggedBincount` op(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8b677d79167799f71c42fd3fa074476e0295413a/tensorflow/core/kernels/bincount_op.cc#L430-L433). Before the `for` loop, `batch_idx` is set to 0. The user controls the `splits` array, making it contain only one element, 0. Thus, the code in the `while` loop would increment `batch_idx` and then try to read `splits(1)`, which is outside of bounds. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2 and TensorFlow 2.3.3, as these are also affected.\n\n- CVE-2021-29514: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. If the `splits` argument of `RaggedBincount` does not specify a valid `SparseTensor`(https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/sparse/SparseTensor), then an attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow. This will cause a read from outside the bounds of the `splits` tensor buffer in the implementation of the `RaggedBincount` op(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8b677d79167799f71c42fd3fa074476e0295413a/tensorflow/core/kernels/bincount_op.cc#L430-L446). Before the `for` loop, `batch_idx` is set to 0. The attacker sets `splits(0)` to be 7, hence the `while` loop does not execute and `batch_idx` remains 0. This then results in writing to `out(-1, bin)`, which is before the heap allocated buffer for the output tensor. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2 and TensorFlow 2.3.3, as these are also affected.\n\n- CVE-2021-29520: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.

We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29542: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow by passing crafted inputs to `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams`. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1cdd4da14282210cc759e468d9781741ac7d01bf/tensorflow/core/kernels/string_ngrams_op.cc#L171-L185) fails to consider corner cases where input would be split in such a way that the generated tokens should only contain padding elements. If input is such that `num_tokens` is 0, then, for `data_start_index=0` (when left padding is present), the marked line would result in reading `data[-1]`.

Since the user controls the shape of the input arguments, an attacker could trigger a heap OOB access when `parent_output_index` is shorter than `row_split`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29576: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.

The SSH protocol keeps track of two shared secrets during the lifetime of the session. One of them is called secret_hash and the other session_id. Initially, both of them are the same, but after key re-exchange, previous session_id is kept and used as an input to new secret_hash. Historically, both of these buffers had shared length variable, which worked as long as these buffers were same. But the key re-exchange operation can also change the key exchange method, which can be based on hash of different size, eventually creating \"secret_hash\" of different size than the session_id has.

In version 2.8.0, the `TensorKey` hash function used total estimated `AllocatedBytes()`, which (a) is an estimate per tensor, and (b) is a very poor hash function for constants (e.g. `int32_t`). It also tried to access individual tensor bytes through `tensor.data()` of size `AllocatedBytes()`. This led to ASAN failures because the `AllocatedBytes()` is an estimate of total bytes allocated by a tensor, including any pointed-to constructs (e.g. strings), and does not refer to contiguous bytes in the `.data()` buffer. The discoverers could not use this byte vector anyway because types such as `tstring` include pointers, whereas they needed to hash the string values themselves.

The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNorm` is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. If the tensors are empty, the same implementation can trigger undefined behavior by dereferencing null pointers. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/57d86e0db5d1365f19adcce848dfc1bf89fdd4c7/tensorflow/core/kernels/fused_batch_norm_op.cc) fails to validate that `scale`, `offset`, `mean` and `variance` (the last two only when required) all have the same number of elements as the number of channels of `x`. This results in heap out of bounds reads when the buffers backing these tensors are indexed past their boundary. If the tensors are empty, the validation mentioned in the above paragraph would also trigger and prevent the undefined behavior. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29988: Firefox incorrectly treated an inline list-item element as a block element, resulting in an out of bounds read or memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

The function ezxml_parse_str() performs incorrect memory handling while parsing crafted XML files (out-of-bounds read after a certain strcspn failure).\n\n- CVE-2021-32761: Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. A vulnerability involving out-of-bounds read and integer overflow to buffer overflow exists starting with version 2.2 and prior to versions 5.0.13, 6.0.15, and 6.2.5. On 32-bit systems, Redis `*BIT*` command are vulnerable to integer overflow that can potentially be exploited to corrupt the heap, leak arbitrary heap contents or trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter to a very large value and constructing specially crafted commands bit commands. This problem only affects Redis on 32-bit platforms, or compiled as a 32-bit binary. Redis versions 5.0.`3m 6.0.15, and 6.2.5 contain patches for this issue. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the `redis-server` executable is to prevent users from modifying the `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.\n\n- CVE-2021-3409: The patch for CVE-2020-17380/CVE-2020-25085 was found to be ineffective, thus making QEMU vulnerable to the out-of-bounds read/write access issues previously found in the SDHCI controller emulation code. This flaw allows a malicious privileged guest to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service or potential code execution. QEMU up to (including) 5.2.0 is affected by this.\n\n- CVE-2021-3517: There is a flaw in the xml entity encoding functionality of libxml2 in versions before 2.9.11. An attacker who is able to supply a crafted file to be processed by an application linked with the affected functionality of libxml2 could trigger an out-of-bounds read. The most likely impact of this flaw is to application availability, with some potential impact to confidentiality and integrity if an attacker is able to use memory information to further exploit the application.\n\n- CVE-2021-3712: ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2y).\n\n- CVE-2021-31174: Microsoft Excel Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-27408: The affected product is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read, which can cause information leakage leading to arbitrary code execution if chained to the out-of-bounds write vulnerability on the Welch Allyn medical device management tools (Welch Allyn Service Tool: versions prior to v1.10, Welch Allyn Connex Device Integration Suite \u2013 Network Connectivity Engine (NCE): versions prior to v5.3, Welch Allyn Software Development Kit (SDK): versions prior to v3.2, Welch Allyn Connex Central Station (CS): versions prior to v1.8.6, Welch Allyn Service Monitor: versions prior to v1.7.0.0, Welch Allyn Connex Vital Signs Monitor (CVSM): versions prior to v2.43.02, Welch Allyn Connex Integrated Wall System (CIWS): versions prior to v2.43.02, Welch Allyn Connex Spot Monitor (CSM): versions prior to v1.52, Welch Allyn Spot Vital Signs 4400 Device (Spot 4400) / Welch Allyn Spot 4400 Vital Signs Extended Care Device: versions prior to v1.11.00).\n\n- CVE-2021-27791: The function that is used to parse the Authentication header in Brocade Fabric OS Web application service before Brocade Fabric OS v9.0.1a and v8.2.3a fails to properly process a malformed authentication header from the client, resulting in reading memory addresses outside the intended range.

Prior to version 2.0.2, there is a bug in Wasmtime's implementation of its pooling instance allocator when the allocator is configured to give WebAssembly instances a maximum of zero pages of memory. In this configuration, the virtual memory mapping for WebAssembly memories did not meet the compiler-required configuration requirements for safely executing WebAssembly modules. Wasmtime's default settings require virtual memory page faults to indicate that wasm reads/writes are out-of-bounds, but the pooling allocator's configuration would not create an appropriate virtual memory mapping for this meaning out of bounds reads/writes can successfully read/write memory unrelated to the wasm sandbox within range of the base address of the memory mapping created by the pooling allocator. This bug is not applicable with the default settings of the `wasmtime` crate. This bug can only be triggered by setting `InstanceLimits::memory_pages` to zero. This is expected to be a very rare configuration since this means that wasm modules cannot allocate any pages of linear memory. All wasm modules produced by all current toolchains are highly likely to use linear memory, so it's expected to be unlikely that this configuration is set to zero by any production embedding of Wasmtime. This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2. This bug can be worked around by increasing the `memory_pages` allotment when configuring the pooling allocator to a value greater than zero. If an embedding wishes to still prevent memory from actually being used then the `Store::limiter` method can be used to dynamically disallow growth of memory beyond 0 bytes large. Note that the default `memory_pages` value is greater than zero.\n\n- CVE-2022-41902: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The function MakeGrapplerFunctionItem takes arguments that determine the sizes of inputs and outputs. If the inputs given are greater than or equal to the sizes of the outputs, an out-of-bounds memory read or a crash is triggered. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit a65411a1d69edfb16b25907ffb8f73556ce36bb7. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.8.4, 2.9.3, and 2.10.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-41981: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the TGA file format parser of OpenImageIO v2.3.19.0. A specially-crafted targa file can lead to out of bounds read and write on the process stack, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-4203: A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. In theory it could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext) although we are not aware of any working exploit leading to memory contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects. \n\n- CVE-2022-48303: GNU Tar through 1.34 has a one-byte out-of-bounds read that results in use of uninitialized memory for a conditional jump. Exploitation to change the flow of control has not been demonstrated.

This will allow an attacker to send a NEWSCAN request to a listening agent on the network as well as receive the agent's HTTP request verifying its authtoken. In AEAgent.cpp, the agent responding back over HTTP is vulnerable to a Heap Overflow if the POST payload response is too large. The POST payload response is converted to Unicode using vswprintf. This is written to a buffer only 0x2000 bytes big. If POST payload is larger, then heap overflow will occur.\n\n- CVE-2021-20110: Due to Manage Engine Asset Explorer Agent 1.0.34 not validating HTTPS certificates, an attacker on the network can statically configure their IP address to match the Asset Explorer's Server IP address. This will allow an attacker to send a NEWSCAN request to a listening agent on the network as well as receive the agent's HTTP request verifying its authtoken. In httphandler.cpp, the agent reaching out over HTTP is vulnerable to an Integer Overflow, which can be turned into a Heap Overflow allowing for remote code execution as NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM on the agent machine. The Integer Overflow occurs when receiving POST response from the Manage Engine server, and the agent calling \"HttpQueryInfoW\" in order to get the \"Content-Length\" size from the incoming POST request. This size is taken, but multiplied to a larger amount. If an attacker specifies a Content-Length size of 1073741823 or larger, this integer arithmetic will wrap the value back around to smaller integer, then calls \"calloc\" with this size to allocate memory. The following API \"InternetReadFile\" will copy the POST data into this buffer, which will be too small for the contents, and cause heap overflow.\n\n- CVE-2021-32728: The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud Server with a computer. Clients using the Nextcloud end-to-end encryption feature download the public and private key via an API endpoint. In versions prior to 3.3.0, the Nextcloud Desktop client fails to check if a private key belongs to previously downloaded public certificate. If the Nextcloud instance serves a malicious public key, the data would be encrypted for this key and thus could be accessible to a malicious actor. This issue is fixed in Nextcloud Desktop Client version 3.3.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.\n\n- CVE-2021-20327: A specific version of the Node.js mongodb-client-encryption module does not perform correct validation of the KMS server\u2019s certificate. This vulnerability in combination with a privileged network position active MITM attack could result in interception of traffic between the Node.js driver and the KMS service rendering client-side field level encryption (CSFLE) ineffective. This issue was discovered during internal testing and affects mongodb-client-encryption module version 1.2.0, which was available from 2021-Jan-29 and deprecated in the NPM Registry on 2021-Feb-04. This vulnerability does not impact driver traffic payloads with CSFLE-supported key services from applications residing inside the AWS, GCP, and Azure nework fabrics due to compensating controls in these environments. This issue does not impact driver workloads that don\u2019t use Field Level Encryption. This issue affect MongoDB Node.js Driver mongodb-client-encryption module version 1.2.0 \n\n- CVE-2021-20732: The ATOM (ATOM - Smart life App for Android versions prior to 1.8.1 and ATOM - Smart life App for iOS versions prior to 1.8.2) does not verify server certificate properly, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to eavesdrop on encrypted communication via a crafted certificate.\n\n- CVE-2021-20833: The SNKRDUNK Market Place App for iOS versions prior to 2.2.0 does not verify server certificate properly, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to eavesdrop on and/or alter encrypted communication via a crafted certificate.\n\n- CVE-2021-21559: Dell EMC NetWorker, versions 18.x, 19.1.x, 19.2.x 19.3.x, 19.4, and 19.4.0.1 contain an Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in the client (NetWorker Management Console) components which uses SSL encrypted connection in order to communicate with the application server. An unauthenticated attacker in the same network collision domain as the NetWorker Management Console client could potentially exploit this vulnerability to perform man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept and tamper the traffic between the client and the application server.\n\n- CVE-2021-32727: Nextcloud Android Client is the Android client for Nextcloud. Clients using the Nextcloud end-to-end encryption feature download the public and private key via an API endpoint. In versions prior to 3.16.1, the Nextcloud Android client skipped a step that involved the client checking if a private key belonged to a previously downloaded public certificate. If the Nextcloud instance served a malicious public key, the data would be encrypted for this key and thus could be accessible to a malicious actor. The vulnerability is patched in version 3.16.1. As a workaround, do not add additional end-to-end encrypted devices to a user account.\n\n- CVE-2021-3547: OpenVPN 3 Core Library version 3.6 and 3.6.1 allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to bypass the certificate authentication by issuing an unrelated server certificate using the same hostname found in the verify-x509-name option in a client configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-20989: Fibaro Home Center 2 and Lite devices with firmware version 4.600 and older initiate SSH connections to the Fibaro cloud to provide remote access and remote support capabilities. This connection can be intercepted using DNS spoofing attack and a device initiated remote port-forward channel can be used to connect to the web management interface. Knowledge of authorization credentials to the management interface is required to perform any further actions.\n\n- CVE-2020-12053: In Unisys Stealth 3.4.x, 4.x and 5.x before 5.0.026, if certificate-based authorization is used without HTTPS, an endpoint could be authorized without a private key.\n\n- CVE-2021-3162: Docker Desktop Community before 2.5.0.0 on macOS mishandles certificate checking, leading to local privilege escalation.\n\n- CVE-2021-43882: Microsoft Defender for IoT Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2020-0601: A spoofing vulnerability exists in the way Windows CryptoAPI (Crypt32.dll) validates Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) certificates.An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by using a spoofed code-signing certificate to sign a malicious executable, making it appear the file was from a trusted, legitimate source, aka 'Windows CryptoAPI Spoofing Vulnerability'.\n\n- CVE-2021-3935: When PgBouncer is configured to use \"cert\" authentication, a man-in-the-middle attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries when a connection is first established, despite the use of TLS certificate verification and encryption. This flaw affects PgBouncer versions prior to 1.16.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-20703: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Small Business RV160, RV260, RV340, and RV345 Series Routers could allow an attacker to do any of the following: Execute arbitrary code Elevate privileges Execute arbitrary commands Bypass authentication and authorization protections Fetch and run unsigned software Cause denial of service (DoS) For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2022-26923: Active Directory Domain Services Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2022-1632: An Improper Certificate Validation attack was found in Openshift. A re-encrypt Route with destinationCACertificate explicitly set to the default serviceCA skips internal Service TLS certificate validation. This flaw allows an attacker to exploit an invalid certificate, resulting in a loss of confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2022-29482: 'Mobaoku-Auction&Flea Market' App for iOS versions prior to 5.5.16 improperly verifies server certificates, which may allow an attacker to eavesdrop on an encrypted communication via a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\n- CVE-2022-34156: 'Hulu / ????' App for iOS versions prior to 3.0.81 improperly verifies server certificates, which may allow an attacker to eavesdrop on an encrypted communication via a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\n- CVE-2022-45597: ComponentSpace.Saml2 4.4.0 Missing SSL Certificate Validation. NOTE: the vendor does not consider this a vulnerability because the report is only about use of certificates at the application layer (not the transport layer) and \"Certificates are exchanged in a controlled fashion between entities within a trust relationship. This is why self-signed certificates may be used and why validating certificates isn\u2019t as important as doing so for the transport layer certificates.\"\n\n- CVE-2022-29908: The folioupdate service in Fabasoft Cloud Enterprise Client 22.4.0043 allows Local Privilege Escalation.\n\n- CVE-2021-45035: Velneo vClient on its 28.1.3 version, does not correctly check the certificate of authenticity by default. This could allow an attacker that has access to the network to perform a MITM attack in order to obtain the user\u00b4s credentials.\n\n- CVE-2022-25640: In wolfSSL before 5.2.0, a TLS 1.3 server cannot properly enforce a requirement for mutual authentication. A client can simply omit the certificate_verify message from the handshake, and never present a certificate.\n\n- CVE-2022-31083: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-287 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-287 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-322 (PeerOf)",

Specifically, these binaries are vulnerable to the following issues: - stack buffer overflow in formRebootCheck due to unsafe copy of submit-url parameter - stack buffer overflow in formWsc due to unsafe copy of submit-url parameter - stack buffer overflow in formWlanMultipleAP due to unsafe copy of submit-url parameter - stack buffer overflow in formWlSiteSurvey due to unsafe copy of ifname parameter - stack buffer overflow in formStaticDHCP due to unsafe copy of hostname parameter - stack buffer overflow in formWsc due to unsafe copy of 'peerPin' parameter - arbitrary command execution in formSysCmd via the sysCmd parameter - arbitrary command injection in formWsc via the 'peerPin' parameter Exploitability of identified issues will differ based on what the end vendor/manufacturer did with the Realtek SDK webserver. Some vendors use it as-is, others add their own authentication implementation, some kept all the features from the server, some remove some of them, some inserted their own set of features. However, given that Realtek SDK implementation is full of insecure calls and that developers tends to re-use those examples in their custom code, any binary based on Realtek SDK webserver will probably contains its own set of issues on top of the Realtek ones (if kept). Successful exploitation of these issues allows remote attackers to gain arbitrary code execution on the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-35474: Stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in cachekey plugin of Apache Traffic Server.

From inspection it is clear that the defect is also present in releases from those series, but they have not been officially tested for the vulnerability), The outcome of encountering the defect while reading a lease that will trigger it varies, according to: the component being affected (i.e., dhclient or dhcpd) whether the package was built as a 32-bit or 64-bit binary whether the compiler flag -fstack-protection-strong was used when compiling In dhclient, ISC has not successfully reproduced the error on a 64-bit system. However, on a 32-bit system it is possible to cause dhclient to crash when reading an improper lease, which could cause network connectivity problems for an affected system due to the absence of a running DHCP client process. In dhcpd, when run in DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 mode: if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 32-bit architecture AND the -fstack-protection-strong flag was specified to the compiler, dhcpd may exit while parsing a lease file containing an objectionable lease, resulting in lack of service to clients. Additionally, the offending lease and the lease immediately following it in the lease database may be improperly deleted. if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 64-bit architecture OR if the -fstack-protection-strong compiler flag was NOT specified, the crash will not occur, but it is possible for the offending lease and the lease which immediately followed it to be improperly deleted.\n\n- CVE-2020-14107: A stack overflow in the HTTP server of Cast can be exploited to make the app crash in LAN.\n\n- CVE-2021-38427: RTI Connext DDS Professional and Connext DDS Secure Versions 4.2.x to 6.1.0 are vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, which may allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-42529: XMP Toolkit SDK version 2021.07 (and earlier) is affected by a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.

Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may be further mitigated based on stack layout for any given platform/compiler. Pre-announcements of CVE-2022-3602 described this issue as CRITICAL. Further analysis based on some of the mitigating factors described above have led this to be downgraded to HIGH. Users are still encouraged to upgrade to a new version as soon as possible. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.

The implementation of `tf.io.decode_raw` produces incorrect results and crashes the Python interpreter when combining `fixed_length` and wider datatypes. The implementation of the padded version(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc) is buggy due to a confusion about pointer arithmetic rules. First, the code computes(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L61) the width of each output element by dividing the `fixed_length` value to the size of the type argument. The `fixed_length` argument is also used to determine the size needed for the output tensor(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L63-L79). This is followed by reencoding code(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L85-L94). The erroneous code is the last line above: it is moving the `out_data` pointer by `fixed_length * sizeof(T)` bytes whereas it only copied at most `fixed_length` bytes from the input. This results in parts of the input not being decoded into the output. Furthermore, because the pointer advance is far wider than desired, this quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data. This OOB write leads to interpreter crash in the reproducer mentioned here, but more severe attacks can be mounted too, given that this gadget allows writing to periodically placed locations in memory. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29947: Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 87.

This value may be required as an index into a buffer, a loop iterator, or simply necessary state data. In any case, the value cannot be trusted and the system will be in an undefined state. While this method may be employed viably to isolate the low bits of a value, this usage is rare, and truncation usually implies that an implementation error has occurred.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-17087: Chain: integer truncation (CWE-197) causes small buffer allocation (CWE-131) leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) in kernel pool, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2009-0231: Integer truncation of length value leads to heap-based buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2008-3282: Size of a particular type changes for 64-bit platforms, leading to an integer truncation in document processor causes incorrect index to be generated.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-21859: An exploitable integer truncation vulnerability exists within the MPEG-4 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library v1.0.1. The stri_box_read function is used when processing atoms using the 'stri' FOURCC code. An attacker can convince a user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-21860: An exploitable integer truncation vulnerability exists within the MPEG-4 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library v1.0.1. A specially crafted MPEG-4 input can cause an improper memory allocation resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory corruption. The FOURCC code, 'trik', is parsed by the function within the library. An attacker can convince a user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-21861: An exploitable integer truncation vulnerability exists within the MPEG-4 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library v1.0.1. When processing the 'hdlr' FOURCC code, a specially crafted MPEG-4 input can cause an improper memory allocation resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory corruption. An attacker can convince a user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-21862: Multiple exploitable integer truncation vulnerabilities exist within the MPEG-4 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library v1.0.1. A specially crafted MPEG-4 input can cause an improper memory allocation resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory corruption The implementation of the parser used for the \u201cXtra\u201d FOURCC code is handled.

Versions prior to 4.9 are vulnerable to an Out-of-bounds read. While processing the L2CAP protocol, the Bluetooth Low Energy stack of Contiki-NG needs to map an incoming channel ID to its metadata structure. While looking up the corresponding channel structure in get_channel_for_cid (in os/net/mac/ble/ble-l2cap.c), a bounds check is performed on the incoming channel ID, which is meant to ensure that the channel ID does not exceed the maximum number of supported channels.However, an integer truncation issue leads to only the lowest byte of the channel ID to be checked, which leads to an incomplete out-of-bounds check. A crafted channel ID leads to out-of-bounds memory to be read and written with attacker-controlled data. The vulnerability has been patched in the \"develop\" branch of Contiki-NG, and will be included in release 4.9. As a workaround, Users can apply the patch in Contiki-NG pull request 2081 on GitHub.\n\n- CVE-2022-42324: Oxenstored 32->31 bit integer truncation issues Integers in Ocaml are 63 or 31 bits of signed precision. The Ocaml Xenbus library takes a C uint32_t out of the ring and casts it directly to an Ocaml integer. In 64-bit Ocaml builds this is fine, but in 32-bit builds, it truncates off the most significant bit, and then creates unsigned/signed confusion in the remainder. This in turn can feed a negative value into logic not expecting a negative value, resulting in unexpected exceptions being thrown. The unexpected exception is not handled suitably, creating a busy-loop trying (and failing) to take the bad packet out of the xenstore ring.\n\n- CVE-2022-34169: The Apache Xalan Java XSLT library is vulnerable to an integer truncation issue when processing malicious XSLT stylesheets. This can be used to corrupt Java class files generated by the internal XSLTC compiler and execute arbitrary Java bytecode. Users are recommended to update to version 2.7.3 or later. Note: Java runtimes (such as OpenJDK) include repackaged copies of Xalan.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-681 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-681 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-681 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-195 (CanAlsoBe)\n\n- CWE-196 (CanAlsoBe)\n\n- CWE-192 (CanAlsoBe)\n\n- CWE-194 (CanAlsoBe)",

    "enhanced_query": "## Vulnerability Description\nA flaw was found in grub2. When performing a symlink lookup from a reiserfs filesystem, grubs reiserfs fs module uses user-controlled parameters from the filesystem geometry to determine the internal buffer size, however, it **improperly checks for integer overflows**. A maliciouly crafted filesystem may lead some of those buffer size calculations to overflow, causing it to perform a grub_malloc() operation with a smaller size than expected. As a result, the grub_reiserfs_read_symlink() will call grub_reiserfs_read_real() with a overflown length parameter, leading to a heap based out-of-bounds write during data reading. This flaw may be leveraged to corrupt grubs internal critical data and can result in arbitrary code execution, by-passing secure boot protections.\n\n### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\n- **component:** reiserfs fs module\n- **rootcause:** **improperly checks for integer overflows**\n- **vector:** maliciously crafted filesystem\n- **weakness:** **heap based out-of-bounds write, buffer size calculations overflow**\n- **product:** grub2\n- **impact:** ['arbitrary code execution', 'bypass secure boot protections', 'corrupt grubs internal critical data']\n\n## CVE Reference Links Content Summary\n## Analysis of CVE-2025-0684 Content\n\nHere's an analysis of the provided content, focusing on information relevant to CVE-2025-0684, as described in the bug report:\n\n**1.

Details beyond official CVE description:**\n\nThe bug report provides a more detailed explanation of *how* the integer overflow leads to the out-of-bounds write, specifically mentioning the `grub_reiserfs_read_symlink()` and `grub_reiserfs_read_real()` functions and the overflowed length parameter. It also explicitly states the potential to bypass secure boot protections.\n\n## Retriever Results\n\n### Top Combined Results\n\n| Rank | CWE ID | Name | Abstraction | Usage  | Retrievers | Individual Scores |\n|------|--------|------|-------------|-------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | 190 | Integer Overflow or Wraparound | Base | Allowed | alternate_terms | 0.800 |\n| 2 | 1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.662 |\n| 3 | 191 | Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound) | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.649 |\n| 4 | 193 | Off-by-one Error | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.637 |\n| 5 | 131 | Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.637 |\n| 6 | 909 | Missing Initialization of Resource | Class | Allowed-with-Review | dense | 0.594 |\n| 7 | 1339 | Insufficient Precision or Accuracy of a Real Number | Base | Allowed | graph | 0.002 |\n| 8 | 122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | Variant | Allowed | sparse | 0.619 |\n| 9 | 125 | Out-of-bounds Read | Base | Allowed | sparse | 0.614 |\n| 10 | 119 | Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer | Class | Discouraged | sparse | 0.603 |\n\n\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to store in the\n         associated representation. When this occurs, the value may\n         become a very small or negative number.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOverflow: The terms \"overflow\" and \"wraparound\" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.\nWraparound: The terms \"overflow\" and \"wraparound\" are used interchangeably by some people, but they can have more precise distinctions by others. See Terminology Notes.\nwrap, wrap-around, wrap around: Alternate spellings of \"wraparound\"\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Be careful of terminology problems with \"overflow,\" \"underflow,\" and \"wraparound\" - see Terminology Notes. Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n**Suggested Alternatives:**\n- CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound). Consider CWE-191 when the result is less than the minimum value that can be represented (sometimes called \"underflows\").\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Integer overflows can be primary to buffer overflows when they cause less memory to be allocated than expected.\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\n\"Integer overflow\" is sometimes used to cover several types of errors, including signedness errors, or buffer overflows that involve manipulation of integer data types instead of characters. Part of the confusion results from the fact that 0xffffffff is -1 in a signed context. Other confusion also arises because of the role that integer overflows have in chains.\n\n\nA \"wraparound\" is a well-defined, standard behavior that follows specific rules for how to handle situations when the intended numeric value is too large or too small to be represented, as specified in standards such as C11.\n\n\n\"Overflow\" is sometimes conflated with \"wraparound\" but typically indicates a non-standard or undefined behavior.\n\n\nThe \"overflow\" term is sometimes used to indicate cases where either the maximum or the minimum is exceeded, but others might only use \"overflow\" to indicate exceeding the maximum while using \"underflow\" for exceeding the minimum.\n\n\nSome people use \"overflow\" to mean any value outside the representable range - whether greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum - but CWE uses \"underflow\" for cases in which the intended result is less than the minimum.\n\n\nSee [REF-1440] for additional explanation of the ambiguity of terminology.\n\n\n**[Other]** While there may be circumstances in which the logic intentionally relies on wrapping - such as with modular arithmetic in timers or counters - it can have security consequences if the wrap is unexpected. This is especially the case if the integer overflow can be triggered using user-supplied inputs.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2022-0545:** Chain: 3D renderer has an integer overflow (CWE-190) leading to write-what-where condition (CWE-123) using a crafted image.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify a quantity (such as size or length), but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the quantity has the required properties.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nSpecified quantities include size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, and others. Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-789\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** This entry is still under development and will continue to see updates and content improvements.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-21668:** Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n- **CVE-2008-1440:** lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop\n- **CVE-2008-2374:** lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.\n\n### Extended Description\nThis can happen in signed and unsigned cases.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nInteger underflow: \n\n\"Integer underflow\" is sometimes used to identify signedness errors in which an originally positive number becomes negative as a result of subtraction. However, there are cases of bad subtraction in which unsigned integers are involved, so it's not always a signedness issue.\n\n\n\"Integer underflow\" is occasionally used to describe array index errors in which the index is negative.\n\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** This is not always a buffer overflow. For example, an off-by-one error could be a factor in a partial comparison, a read from the wrong memory location, an incorrect conditional, etc.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2003-0252:** Off-by-one error allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via requests that do not contain newlines.\n- **CVE-2001-1391:** Off-by-one vulnerability in driver allows users to modify kernel memory.\n- **CVE-2002-0083:** Off-by-one error allows local users or remote malicious servers to gain privileges.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Some examples include:\n\n\n  - simple math errors,\n\n  - incorrectly updating parallel counters,\n\n  - not accounting for size differences when \"transforming\" one input to another format (e.g. URL canonicalization or other transformation that can generate a result that's larger than the original input, i.e. \"expansion\").\n\nThis level of detail is rarely available in public reports, so it is difficult to find good examples.\n\n**[Maintenance]** \n\nThis weakness may be a composite or a chain. It also may contain layering or perspective differences.\n\n\nThis issue may be associated with many different types of incorrect calculations (CWE-682), although the integer overflow (CWE-190) is probably the most prevalent. This can be primary to resource consumption problems (CWE-400), including uncontrolled memory allocation (CWE-789). However, its relationship with out-of-bounds buffer access (CWE-119) must also be considered.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-17087:** Chain: integer truncation (CWE-197) causes small buffer allocation (CWE-131) leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) in kernel pool, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2004-1363:** substitution overflow: buffer overflow using environment variables that are expanded after the length check is performed\n- **CVE-2004-0747:** substitution overflow: buffer overflow using expansion of environment variables\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product does not initialize a critical resource.\n\n### Extended Description\nMany resources require initialization before they can be properly used. If a resource is not initialized, it could contain unpredictable or expired data, or it could be initialized to defaults that are invalid. This can have security implications when the resource is expected to have certain properties or values.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nChildOf -> CWE-665\nCanPrecede -> CWE-908\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed-with-Review\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n**Comments:** Examine children of this entry to see if there is a better fit\n**Reasons:**\n- Abstraction\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-20739:** A variable that has its value set in a conditional statement is sometimes used when the conditional fails, sometimes causing data leakage\n- **CVE-2005-1036:** Chain: Bypass of access restrictions due to improper authorization (CWE-862) of a user results from an improperly initialized (CWE-909) I/O permission bitmap\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-1339: Insufficient Precision or Accuracy of a Real Number\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product processes a real number with an implementation in which the number's representation does not preserve required accuracy and precision in its fractional part, causing an incorrect result.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nWhen a security decision or calculation requires highly precise, accurate numbers such as financial calculations or prices, then small variations in the number could be exploited by an attacker. \n\n\nThere are multiple ways to store the fractional part of a real number in a computer. In all of these cases, there is a limit to the accuracy of recording a fraction. If the fraction can be represented in a fixed number of digits (binary or decimal), there might not be enough digits assigned to represent the number. In other cases the number cannot be represented in a fixed number of digits due to repeating in decimal or binary notation (e.g. 0.333333...) or due to a transcendental number such as \u03a0 or \u221a2. Rounding of numbers can lead to situations where the computer results do not adequately match the result of sufficiently accurate math. \n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-682\nPeerOf -> CWE-190\nCanPrecede -> CWE-834\nCanPrecede -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Relationship]** Heap-based buffer overflows are usually just as dangerous as stack-based buffer overflows.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-43537:** Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2007-4268:** Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)\n- **CVE-2009-2523:** Chain: product does not handle when an input string is not NULL terminated (CWE-170), leading to buffer over-read (CWE-125) or heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nOOB read: Shorthand for \"Out of bounds\" read\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\nChildOf -> CWE-119\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2023-1018:** The reference implementation code for a Trusted Platform Module does not implement length checks on data, allowing for an attacker to read 2 bytes past the end of a buffer.\n- **CVE-2020-11899:** Out-of-bounds read in IP stack used in embedded systems, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2014-0160:** Chain: \"Heartbleed\" bug receives an inconsistent length parameter (CWE-130) enabling an out-of-bounds read (CWE-126), returning memory that could include private cryptographic keys and other sensitive data.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction:** Class\n**Status:** Stable\n\n### Description\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nBuffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools intend for it to mean \"write past the end of a buffer,\" whereas others use the same term to mean \"any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer.\" Others could mean \"any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write.\" Since the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.\nbuffer overrun: Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term \"buffer overrun,\" but most people use \"buffer overflow.\" See the alternate term for \"buffer overflow\" for context.\nmemory safety: Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the \"memory safety\" term.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-118\nChildOf -> CWE-20\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Discouraged\n**Rationale:** CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.\n**Comments:** Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.\n**Reasons:**\n- Frequent Misuse\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Applicable Platform]** \n\nIt is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2021-22991:** Incorrect URI normalization in application traffic product leads to buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-29557:** Buffer overflow in Wi-Fi router web interface, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2009-2550:** Classic stack-based buffer overflow in media player using a long entry in a playlist\n\n",

Code may rely on specified quantities to allocate resources, perform calculations, control iteration, etc. When the quantity is not properly validated, then attackers can specify malicious quantities to cause excessive resource allocation, trigger unexpected failures, enable buffer overflows, etc.\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-21668: Chain: Python library does not limit the resources used to process images that specify a very large number of bands (CWE-1284), leading to excessive memory consumption (CWE-789) or an integer overflow (CWE-190).\n\n- CVE-2008-1440: lack of validation of length field leads to infinite loop\n\n- CVE-2008-2374: lack of validation of string length fields allows memory consumption or buffer over-read\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-31401: An issue was discovered in tcp_rcv() in nptcp.c in HCC embedded InterNiche 4.0.1. The TCP header processing code doesn't sanitize the value of the IP total length field (header length + data length). With a crafted IP packet, an integer overflow occurs whenever the value of the IP data length is calculated by subtracting the length of the header from the total length of the IP packet.\n\n- CVE-2021-31802: NETGEAR R7000 1.0.11.116 devices have a heap-based Buffer Overflow that is exploitable from the local network without authentication. The vulnerability exists within the handling of an HTTP request. An attacker can leverage this to execute code as root. The problem is that a user-provided length value is trusted during a backup.cgi file upload. The attacker must add a \\\\n before the Content-Length header.\n\n- CVE-2021-37663: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions due to incomplete validation in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeV2`, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/84d053187cb80d975ef2b9684d4b61981bca0c41/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_op.cc#L59) has some validation but does not check that `min_range` and `max_range` both have the same non-zero number of elements. If `axis` is provided (i.e., not `-1`), then validation should check that it is a value in range for the rank of `input` tensor and then the lengths of `min_range` and `max_range` inputs match the `axis` dimension of the `input` tensor. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 6da6620efad397c85493b8f8667b821403516708. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-37665: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions due to incomplete validation in MKL implementation of requantization, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/mkl/mkl_requantization_range_per_channel_op.cc) does not validate the dimensions of the `input` tensor. A similar issue occurs in `MklRequantizePerChannelOp`. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/mkl/mkl_requantize_per_channel_op.cc) does not perform full validation for all the input arguments. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 9e62869465573cb2d9b5053f1fa02a81fce21d69 and in the Github commit 203214568f5bc237603dbab6e1fd389f1572f5c9. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-3655: A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel in versions prior to v5.14-rc1.

Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read. While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-25727: Memory Corruption in modem due to improper length check while copying into memory in Snapdragon Consumer IOT, Snapdragon Industrial IOT, Snapdragon Voice & Music\n\n- CVE-2022-25793: A Stack-based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in Autodesk 3ds Max 2022, 2021, and 2020 may lead to code execution through the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer when parsing ActionScript Byte Code files. This vulnerability may allow arbitrary code execution on affected installations of Autodesk 3ds Max.\n\n- CVE-2022-2845: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.0218. \n\n- CVE-2022-35928: AES Crypt is a file encryption software for multiple platforms. AES Crypt for Linux built using the source on GitHub and having the version number 3.11 has a vulnerability with respect to reading user-provided passwords and confirmations via command-line prompts. Passwords lengths were not checked before being read. This vulnerability may lead to buffer overruns. This does _not_ affect source code found on aescrypt.com, nor is the vulnerability present when providing a password or a key via the `-p` or `-k` command-line options. The problem was fixed via in commit 68761851b and will be included in release 3.16. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should us the `-p` or `-k` options to provide a password or key.\n\n- CVE-2022-36063: Azure RTOS USBx is a USB host, device, and on-the-go (OTG) embedded stack, fully integrated with Azure RTOS ThreadX and available for all Azure RTOS ThreadX\u2013supported processors. Azure RTOS USBX implementation of host support for USB CDC ECM includes an integer underflow and a buffer overflow in the `_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function which may be potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution or denial of service. Setting mac address string descriptor length to a `0` or `1` allows an attacker to introduce an integer underflow followed (string_length) by a buffer overflow of the `cdc_ecm -> ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id` array. This may allow one to redirect the code execution flow or introduce a denial of service. The fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel). Improved mac address string descriptor length validation to check for unexpectedly small values may be used as a workaround.\n\n- CVE-2022-36620: D-link DIR-816 A2_v1.10CNB04, DIR-878 DIR_878_FW1.30B08.img is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via /goform/addRouting.\n\n- CVE-2022-37134: D-link DIR-816 A2_v1.10CNB04.img is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via /goform/form2Wan.cgi.

In affected versions the Istio control plane, `istiod`, is vulnerable to a request processing error, allowing a malicious attacker that sends a specially crafted message which results in the control plane crashing. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15012, but does not require any authentication from the attacker. For simple installations, Istiod is typically only reachable from within the cluster, limiting the blast radius. However, for some deployments, especially [multicluster](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/multicluster/primary-remote/) topologies, this port is exposed over the public internet. There are no effective workarounds, beyond upgrading. Limiting network access to Istiod to the minimal set of clients can help lessen the scope of the vulnerability to some extent.\n\n- CVE-2021-31556: An issue was discovered in the Oauth extension for MediaWiki through 1.35.2. MWOAuthConsumerSubmitControl.php does not ensure that the length of an RSA key will fit in a MySQL blob.\n\n- CVE-2022-20686: Multiple vulnerabilities in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) functionality of Cisco ATA 190 Series Analog Telephone Adapter firmware could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device and cause the LLDP service to restart. These vulnerabilities are due to missing length validation of certain LLDP packet header fields. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious LLDP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code on the affected device and cause LLDP to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\n- CVE-2022-20385: a function called 'nla_parse', do not check the len of para, it will check nla_type (which can be controlled by userspace) with 'maxtype' (in this case, it is GSCAN_MAX), then it access polciy array 'policy[type]', which OOB access happens.Product: AndroidVersions: Android SoCAndroid ID: A-238379819\n\n- CVE-2022-26125: Buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in FRRouting through 8.1.0 due to wrong checks on the input packet length in isisd/isis_tlvs.c.\n\n- CVE-2022-26127: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in FRRouting through 8.1.0 due to missing a check on the input packet length in the babel_packet_examin function in babeld/message.c.\n\n- CVE-2022-26128: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in FRRouting through 8.1.0 due to a wrong check on the input packet length in the babel_packet_examin function in babeld/message.c.\n\n- CVE-2022-36086: linked_list_allocator is an allocator usable for no_std systems. Prior to version 0.10.2, the heap initialization methods were missing a minimum size check for the given heap size argument. This could lead to out-of-bound writes when a heap was initialized with a size smaller than `3 * size_of::<usize>` because of metadata write operations. This vulnerability impacts all the initialization functions on the `Heap` and `LockedHeap` types, including `Heap::new`, `Heap::init`, `Heap::init_from_slice`, and `LockedHeap::new`. It also affects multiple uses of the `Heap::extend` method. Version 0.10.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, ensure that the heap is only initialized with a size larger than `3 * size_of::<usize>` and that the `Heap::extend` method is only called with sizes larger than `2 * size_of::<usize>()`. Also, ensure that the total heap size is (and stays) a multiple of `2 * size_of::<usize>()`.\n\n- CVE-2022-36938: DexLoader function get_stringidx_fromdex() in Redex prior to commit 3b44c64 can load an out of bound address when loading the string index table, potentially allowing remote code execution during processing of a 3rd party Android APK file.\n\n- CVE-2021-1058: NVIDIA vGPU software contains a vulnerability in the guest kernel mode driver and vGPU plugin, in which an input data size is not validated, which may lead to tampering of data or denial of service.

In affected versions an attacker can trigger a denial of service via a segmentation fault in `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGrad` caused by missing validation. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/maxpooling_op.cc) misses some validation for the `orig_input` and `orig_output` tensors. The fixes for CVE-2021-29579 were incomplete. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 136b51f10903e044308cf77117c0ed9871350475. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-37677: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the shape inference code for `tf.raw_ops.Dequantize` has a vulnerability that could trigger a denial of service via a segfault if an attacker provides invalid arguments. The shape inference [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/ops/array_ops.cc#L2999-L3014) uses `axis` to select between two different values for `minmax_rank` which is then used to retrieve tensor dimensions. However, code assumes that `axis` can be either `-1` or a value greater than `-1`, with no validation for the other values. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit da857cfa0fde8f79ad0afdbc94e88b5d4bbec764. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-39193: Frontier is Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer. Prior to commit number 0b962f218f0cdd796dadfe26c3f09e68f7861b26, a bug in `pallet-ethereum` can cause invalid transactions to be included in the Ethereum block state in `pallet-ethereum` due to not validating the input data size. Any invalid transactions included this way have no possibility to alter the internal Ethereum or Substrate state. The transaction will appear to have be included, but is of no effect as it is rejected by the EVM engine. The impact is further limited by Substrate extrinsic size constraints. A patch is available in commit number 0b962f218f0cdd796dadfe26c3f09e68f7861b26. There are no workarounds aside from applying the patch.\n\n- CVE-2021-39690: In setDisplayPadding of WallpaperManagerService.java, there is a possible way to cause a persistent DoS due to improper input validation.

This crash affects the availability of the software and dependent downstream components.\n\n- CVE-2022-23580: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. During shape inference, TensorFlow can allocate a large vector based on a value from a tensor controlled by the user. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2022-29202: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.ragged.constant` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a denial of service by consuming all available memory. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-36078: Binary provides encoding/decoding in Borsh and other formats. The vulnerability is a memory allocation vulnerability that can be exploited to allocate slices in memory with (arbitrary) excessive size value, which can either exhaust available memory or crash the whole program. When using `github.com/gagliardetto/binary` to parse unchecked (or wrong type of) data from untrusted sources of input (e.g. the blockchain) into slices, it's possible to allocate memory with excessive size. When `dec.Decode(&val)` method is used to parse data into a structure that is or contains slices of values, the length of the slice was previously read directly from the data itself without any checks on the size of it, and then a slice was allocated. This could lead to an overflow and an allocation of memory with excessive size value. Users should upgrade to `v0.7.1` or higher. A workaround is not to rely on the `dec.Decode(&val)` function to parse the data, but to use a custom `UnmarshalWithDecoder()` method that reads and checks the length of any slice.\n\n- CVE-2022-37311: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large location request parameter to the redirect servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-37312: OX App Suite through 7.10.6 has Uncontrolled Resource Consumption via a large request body containing a redirect URL to the deferrer servlet.\n\n- CVE-2022-39294: conduit-hyper integrates a conduit application with the hyper server. Prior to version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` did not check any limit on a request's length before calling [`hyper::body::to_bytes`](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/body/fn.to_bytes.html). An attacker could send a malicious request with an abnormally large `Content-Length`, which could lead to a panic if memory allocation failed for that request. In version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` sets an internal limit of 128 MiB per request, otherwise returning status 400 (\"Bad Request\"). This crate is part of the implementation of Rust's [crates.io](https://crates.io/), but that service is not affected due to its existing cloud infrastructure, which already drops such malicious requests. Even with the new limit in place, `conduit-hyper` is not recommended for production use, nor to directly serve the public Internet.\n\n- CVE-2022-4111: Unrestricted file size limit can lead to DoS in tooljet/tooljet <1.27 by allowing a logged in attacker to upload profile pictures over 2MB. \n\n- CVE-2022-41968: Nextcloud Server is an open source personal cloud server. Prior to versions 23.0.10 and 24.0.5, calendar name lengths are not validated before writing to a database. As a result, an attacker can send unnecessary amounts of data against the database. Version 23.0.10 and 24.0.5 contain patches for the issue. No known workarounds are available.\n\n- CVE-2022-20488: In NotificationChannel of NotificationChannel.java, there is a possible failure to persist permissions settings due to resource exhaustion. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed.

This vulnerability is due to missing length validation of certain Cisco Discovery Protocol packet header fields. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to exhaust available memory and cause the service to restart. Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability. \n\n- CVE-2022-21208: The package node-opcua before 2.74.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to a missing limitation on the number of received chunks - per single session or in total for all concurrent sessions. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending an unlimited number of huge chunks (e.g. 2GB each) without sending the Final closing chunk.\n\n- CVE-2022-29212: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, certain TFLite models that were created using TFLite model converter would crash when loaded in the TFLite interpreter. The culprit is that during quantization the scale of values could be greater than 1 but code was always assuming sub-unit scaling. Thus, since code was calling `QuantizeMultiplierSmallerThanOneExp`, the `TFLITE_CHECK_LT` assertion would trigger and abort the process. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29196: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackpropFilterV2` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate that the `filter_sizes` argument is a vector. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-29200: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.LSTMBlockCell` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code does not validate the ranks of any of the arguments to this API call. This results in `CHECK`-failures when the elements of the tensor are accessed. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-789 (CanPrecede)",

The case is, in [_ux_host_class_pima_read](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/master/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c), there is data length from device response, returned in the very first packet, and read by [L165 code](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L165), as header_length. Then in [L178 code](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L178), there is a \u201cif\u201d branch, which check the expression of \u201c(header_length - UX_HOST_CLASS_PIMA_DATA_HEADER_SIZE) > data_length\u201d where if header_length is smaller than UX_HOST_CLASS_PIMA_DATA_HEADER_SIZE, calculation could overflow and then [L182 code](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L182) the calculation of data_length is also overflow, this way the later [while loop start from L192](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/082fd9db09a3669eca3358f10b8837a5c1635c0b/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_pima_read.c#L192) can move data_pointer to unexpected address and cause write buffer overflow. The fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel). The following can be used as a workaround: Add check of `header_length`: 1.

An attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedResizeBilinear` by manipulating input values so that float rounding results in off-by-one error in accessing image elements. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/44b7f486c0143f68b56c34e2d01e146ee445134a/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_resize_bilinear_op.cc#L62-L66) computes two integers (representing the upper and lower bounds for interpolation) by ceiling and flooring a floating point value. For some values of `in`, `interpolation->upper[i]` might be smaller than `interpolation->lower[i]`. This is an issue if `interpolation->upper[i]` is capped at `in_size-1` as it means that `interpolation->lower[i]` points outside of the image. Then, in the interpolation code(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/44b7f486c0143f68b56c34e2d01e146ee445134a/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_resize_bilinear_op.cc#L245-L264), this would result in heap buffer overflow. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-3156: Sudo before 1.9.5p2 contains an off-by-one error that can result in a heap-based buffer overflow, which allows privilege escalation to root via \"sudoedit -s\" and a command-line argument that ends with a single backslash character.\n\n- CVE-2021-31875: In mjs_json.c in Cesanta MongooseOS mJS 1.26, a maliciously formed JSON string can trigger an off-by-one heap-based buffer overflow in mjs_json_parse, which can potentially lead to redirection of control flow. NOTE: the original reporter disputes the significance of this finding because \"there isn\u2019t very much of an opportunity to exploit this reliably for an information leak, so there isn\u2019t any real security impact.\"\n\n- CVE-2021-37164: A buffer overflow issue was discovered in HMI3 Control Panel in Swisslog Healthcare Nexus Panel operated by released versions of software before Nexus Software 7.2.5.7. In the tcpTxThread function, the received data is copied to a stack buffer. An off-by-3 condition can occur, resulting in a stack-based buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2020-27171: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. kernel/bpf/verifier.c has an off-by-one error (with a resultant integer underflow) affecting out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic, leading to side-channel attacks that defeat Spectre mitigations and obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, aka CID-10d2bb2e6b1d.\n\n- CVE-2021-21118: Insufficient data validation in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 88.0.4324.96 allowed a remote attacker to potentially perform out of bounds memory access via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2021-21938: A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Palette box parser functionality of Accusoft ImageGear 19.10. A specially-crafted file can lead to code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-3999: A flaw was found in glibc. An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd() may lead to memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. A local attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd() in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.\n\n- CVE-2021-46848: GNU Libtasn1 before 4.19.0 has an ETYPE_OK off-by-one array size check that affects asn1_encode_simple_der.\n\n- CVE-2022-34970: Crow before 1.0+4 has a heap-based buffer overflow via the function qs_parse in query_string.h. On successful exploitation this vulnerability allows attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code in the context of the vulnerable service.\n\n- CVE-2022-3821: An off-by-one Error issue was discovered in Systemd in format_timespan() function of time-util.c. An attacker could supply specific values for time and accuracy that leads to buffer overrun in format_timespan(), leading to a Denial of Service.\n\n- CVE-2022-39274: LoRaMac-node is a reference implementation and documentation of a LoRa network node. Versions of LoRaMac-node prior to 4.7.0 are vulnerable to a buffer overflow. Improper size validation of the incoming radio frames can lead to an 65280-byte out-of-bounds write. The function `ProcessRadioRxDone` implicitly expects incoming radio frames to have at least a payload of one byte or more. An empty payload leads to a 1-byte out-of-bounds read of user controlled content when the payload buffer is reused. This allows an attacker to craft a FRAME_TYPE_PROPRIETARY frame with size -1 which results in an 65280-byte out-of-bounds memcopy likely with partially controlled attacker data. Corrupting a large part if the data section is likely to cause a DoS. If the large out-of-bounds write does not immediately crash the attacker may gain control over the execution due to now controlling large parts of the data section. Users are advised to upgrade either by updating their package or by manually applying the patch commit `e851b079`.\n\n- CVE-2022-47517: An issue was discovered in the libsofia-sip fork in drachtio-server before 0.8.19. It allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a crafted UDP message that causes a url_canonize2 heap-based buffer over-read because of an off-by-one error.\n\n- CVE-2022-36354: A heap out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the RLA format parser of OpenImageIO master-branch-9aeece7a and v2.3.19.0. More specifically, in the way run-length encoded byte spans are handled. A malformed RLA file can lead to an out-of-bounds read of heap metadata which can result in sensitive information leak. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-24988: In galois_2p8 before 0.1.2, PrimitivePolynomialField::new has an off-by-one buffer overflow for a vector.\n\n- CVE-2022-41916: Heimdal is an implementation of ASN.1/DER, PKIX, and Kerberos. Versions prior to 7.7.1 are vulnerable to a denial of service vulnerability in Heimdal's PKI certificate validation library, affecting the KDC (via PKINIT) and kinit (via PKINIT), as well as any third-party applications using Heimdal's libhx509.

Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the \"out\" parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the \"outlen\" parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the \"out\" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k).\n\n- CVE-2021-27378: An issue was discovered in the rand_core crate before 0.6.2 for Rust.

The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4.\n\n- CVE-2021-29512: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. If the `splits` argument of `RaggedBincount` does not specify a valid `SparseTensor`(https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/sparse/SparseTensor), then an attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow. This will cause a read from outside the bounds of the `splits` tensor buffer in the implementation of the `RaggedBincount` op(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8b677d79167799f71c42fd3fa074476e0295413a/tensorflow/core/kernels/bincount_op.cc#L430-L433). Before the `for` loop, `batch_idx` is set to 0. The user controls the `splits` array, making it contain only one element, 0. Thus, the code in the `while` loop would increment `batch_idx` and then try to read `splits(1)`, which is outside of bounds. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2 and TensorFlow 2.3.3, as these are also affected.\n\n- CVE-2021-29514: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. If the `splits` argument of `RaggedBincount` does not specify a valid `SparseTensor`(https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/sparse/SparseTensor), then an attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow. This will cause a read from outside the bounds of the `splits` tensor buffer in the implementation of the `RaggedBincount` op(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8b677d79167799f71c42fd3fa074476e0295413a/tensorflow/core/kernels/bincount_op.cc#L430-L446). Before the `for` loop, `batch_idx` is set to 0. The attacker sets `splits(0)` to be 7, hence the `while` loop does not execute and `batch_idx` remains 0. This then results in writing to `out(-1, bin)`, which is before the heap allocated buffer for the output tensor. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2 and TensorFlow 2.3.3, as these are also affected.\n\n- CVE-2021-29520: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.

We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29542: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow by passing crafted inputs to `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams`.

Since the user controls the shape of the input arguments, an attacker could trigger a heap OOB access when `parent_output_index` is shorter than `row_split`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.

The SSH protocol keeps track of two shared secrets during the lifetime of the session. One of them is called secret_hash and the other session_id. Initially, both of them are the same, but after key re-exchange, previous session_id is kept and used as an input to new secret_hash. Historically, both of these buffers had shared length variable, which worked as long as these buffers were same. But the key re-exchange operation can also change the key exchange method, which can be based on hash of different size, eventually creating \"secret_hash\" of different size than the session_id has. This becomes an issue when the session_id memory is zeroed or when it is used again during second key re-exchange.\n\n- CVE-2021-36530: ngiflib 0.4 has a heap overflow in GetByteStr() at ngiflib.c:108 in NGIFLIB_NO_FILE mode, GetByteStr() copy memory buffer without checking the boundary.\n\n- CVE-2021-36531: ngiflib 0.4 has a heap overflow in GetByte() at ngiflib.c:70 in NGIFLIB_NO_FILE mode, GetByte() reads memory buffer without checking the boundary.\n\n- CVE-2021-36584: An issue was discovered in GPAC 1.0.1.

In version 2.8.0, the `TensorKey` hash function used total estimated `AllocatedBytes()`, which (a) is an estimate per tensor, and (b) is a very poor hash function for constants (e.g. `int32_t`). It also tried to access individual tensor bytes through `tensor.data()` of size `AllocatedBytes()`. This led to ASAN failures because the `AllocatedBytes()` is an estimate of total bytes allocated by a tensor, including any pointed-to constructs (e.g. strings), and does not refer to contiguous bytes in the `.data()` buffer. The discoverers could not use this byte vector anyway because types such as `tstring` include pointers, whereas they needed to hash the string values themselves. This issue is patched in Tensorflow versions 2.9.0 and 2.8.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-2991: A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the Linux kernel's LightNVM subsystem.

The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNorm` is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. If the tensors are empty, the same implementation can trigger undefined behavior by dereferencing null pointers. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/57d86e0db5d1365f19adcce848dfc1bf89fdd4c7/tensorflow/core/kernels/fused_batch_norm_op.cc) fails to validate that `scale`, `offset`, `mean` and `variance` (the last two only when required) all have the same number of elements as the number of channels of `x`. This results in heap out of bounds reads when the buffers backing these tensors are indexed past their boundary. If the tensors are empty, the validation mentioned in the above paragraph would also trigger and prevent the undefined behavior. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29988: Firefox incorrectly treated an inline list-item element as a block element, resulting in an out of bounds read or memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

The function ezxml_parse_str() performs incorrect memory handling while parsing crafted XML files (out-of-bounds read after a certain strcspn failure).\n\n- CVE-2021-32761: Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. A vulnerability involving out-of-bounds read and integer overflow to buffer overflow exists starting with version 2.2 and prior to versions 5.0.13, 6.0.15, and 6.2.5. On 32-bit systems, Redis `*BIT*` command are vulnerable to integer overflow that can potentially be exploited to corrupt the heap, leak arbitrary heap contents or trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter to a very large value and constructing specially crafted commands bit commands. This problem only affects Redis on 32-bit platforms, or compiled as a 32-bit binary. Redis versions 5.0.`3m 6.0.15, and 6.2.5 contain patches for this issue. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the `redis-server` executable is to prevent users from modifying the `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.\n\n- CVE-2021-3409: The patch for CVE-2020-17380/CVE-2020-25085 was found to be ineffective, thus making QEMU vulnerable to the out-of-bounds read/write access issues previously found in the SDHCI controller emulation code. This flaw allows a malicious privileged guest to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service or potential code execution. QEMU up to (including) 5.2.0 is affected by this.\n\n- CVE-2021-3517: There is a flaw in the xml entity encoding functionality of libxml2 in versions before 2.9.11. An attacker who is able to supply a crafted file to be processed by an application linked with the affected functionality of libxml2 could trigger an out-of-bounds read. The most likely impact of this flaw is to application availability, with some potential impact to confidentiality and integrity if an attacker is able to use memory information to further exploit the application.\n\n- CVE-2021-3712: ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2y).\n\n- CVE-2021-31174: Microsoft Excel Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-27408: The affected product is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read, which can cause information leakage leading to arbitrary code execution if chained to the out-of-bounds write vulnerability on the Welch Allyn medical device management tools (Welch Allyn Service Tool: versions prior to v1.10, Welch Allyn Connex Device Integration Suite \u2013 Network Connectivity Engine (NCE): versions prior to v5.3, Welch Allyn Software Development Kit (SDK): versions prior to v3.2, Welch Allyn Connex Central Station (CS): versions prior to v1.8.6, Welch Allyn Service Monitor: versions prior to v1.7.0.0, Welch Allyn Connex Vital Signs Monitor (CVSM): versions prior to v2.43.02, Welch Allyn Connex Integrated Wall System (CIWS): versions prior to v2.43.02, Welch Allyn Connex Spot Monitor (CSM): versions prior to v1.52, Welch Allyn Spot Vital Signs 4400 Device (Spot 4400) / Welch Allyn Spot 4400 Vital Signs Extended Care Device: versions prior to v1.11.00).\n\n- CVE-2021-27791: The function that is used to parse the Authentication header in Brocade Fabric OS Web application service before Brocade Fabric OS v9.0.1a and v8.2.3a fails to properly process a malformed authentication header from the client, resulting in reading memory addresses outside the intended range.

User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-12 Android-12LAndroid ID: A-221856662\n\n- CVE-2022-24314: A CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability exists that could cause memory leaks potentially resulting in denial of service when an attacker repeatedly sends a specially crafted message. Affected Product: Interactive Graphical SCADA System Data Server (V15.0.0.22020 and prior)\n\n- CVE-2022-28285: When generating the assembly code for <code>MLoadTypedArrayElementHole</code>, an incorrect AliasSet was used. In conjunction with another vulnerability this could have been used for an out of bounds memory read. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 91.8, Firefox < 99, and Firefox ESR < 91.8.\n\n- CVE-2022-2964: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel\u2019s driver for the ASIX AX88179_178A-based USB 2.0/3.0 Gigabit Ethernet Devices. The vulnerability contains multiple out-of-bounds reads and possible out-of-bounds writes.\n\n- CVE-2022-32142: Multiple CODESYS Products are prone to a out-of bounds read or write access. A low privileged remote attacker may craft a request with invalid offset, which can cause an out-of-bounds read or write access, resulting in denial-of-service condition or local memory overwrite, which can lead to a change of local files. User interaction is not required.\n\n- CVE-2022-35260: curl can be told to parse a `.netrc` file for credentials. If that file endsin a line with 4095 consecutive non-white space letters and no newline, curlwould first read past the end of the stack-based buffer, and if the readworks, write a zero byte beyond its boundary.This will in most cases cause a segfault or similar, but circumstances might also cause different outcomes.If a malicious user can provide a custom netrc file to an application or otherwise affect its contents, this flaw could be used as denial-of-service.\n\n- CVE-2022-39392: Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to version 2.0.2, there is a bug in Wasmtime's implementation of its pooling instance allocator when the allocator is configured to give WebAssembly instances a maximum of zero pages of memory. In this configuration, the virtual memory mapping for WebAssembly memories did not meet the compiler-required configuration requirements for safely executing WebAssembly modules. Wasmtime's default settings require virtual memory page faults to indicate that wasm reads/writes are out-of-bounds, but the pooling allocator's configuration would not create an appropriate virtual memory mapping for this meaning out of bounds reads/writes can successfully read/write memory unrelated to the wasm sandbox within range of the base address of the memory mapping created by the pooling allocator. This bug is not applicable with the default settings of the `wasmtime` crate. This bug can only be triggered by setting `InstanceLimits::memory_pages` to zero. This is expected to be a very rare configuration since this means that wasm modules cannot allocate any pages of linear memory. All wasm modules produced by all current toolchains are highly likely to use linear memory, so it's expected to be unlikely that this configuration is set to zero by any production embedding of Wasmtime. This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2. This bug can be worked around by increasing the `memory_pages` allotment when configuring the pooling allocator to a value greater than zero. If an embedding wishes to still prevent memory from actually being used then the `Store::limiter` method can be used to dynamically disallow growth of memory beyond 0 bytes large. Note that the default `memory_pages` value is greater than zero.\n\n- CVE-2022-41902: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The function MakeGrapplerFunctionItem takes arguments that determine the sizes of inputs and outputs. If the inputs given are greater than or equal to the sizes of the outputs, an out-of-bounds memory read or a crash is triggered. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit a65411a1d69edfb16b25907ffb8f73556ce36bb7. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.8.4, 2.9.3, and 2.10.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-41981: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the TGA file format parser of OpenImageIO v2.3.19.0. A specially-crafted targa file can lead to out of bounds read and write on the process stack, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2022-4203: A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. In theory it could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext) although we are not aware of any working exploit leading to memory contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects. \n\n- CVE-2022-48303: GNU Tar through 1.34 has a one-byte out-of-bounds read that results in use of uninitialized memory for a conditional jump. Exploitation to change the flow of control has not been demonstrated.

An attacker who is able to submit a crafted file to an application linked with OpenEXR could cause an out-of-bounds read. The greatest risk from this flaw is to application availability.\n\n- CVE-2022-1441: MP4Box is a component of GPAC-2.0.0, which is a widely-used third-party package on RPM Fusion. When MP4Box tries to parse a MP4 file, it calls the function `diST_box_read()` to read from video. In this function, it allocates a buffer `str` with fixed length. However, content read from `bs` is controllable by user, so is the length, which causes a buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2022-3435: A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in Linux Kernel.

This will allow an attacker to send a NEWSCAN request to a listening agent on the network as well as receive the agent's HTTP request verifying its authtoken. In AEAgent.cpp, the agent responding back over HTTP is vulnerable to a Heap Overflow if the POST payload response is too large. The POST payload response is converted to Unicode using vswprintf. This is written to a buffer only 0x2000 bytes big. If POST payload is larger, then heap overflow will occur.\n\n- CVE-2021-20110: Due to Manage Engine Asset Explorer Agent 1.0.34 not validating HTTPS certificates, an attacker on the network can statically configure their IP address to match the Asset Explorer's Server IP address. This will allow an attacker to send a NEWSCAN request to a listening agent on the network as well as receive the agent's HTTP request verifying its authtoken. In httphandler.cpp, the agent reaching out over HTTP is vulnerable to an Integer Overflow, which can be turned into a Heap Overflow allowing for remote code execution as NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM on the agent machine. The Integer Overflow occurs when receiving POST response from the Manage Engine server, and the agent calling \"HttpQueryInfoW\" in order to get the \"Content-Length\" size from the incoming POST request. This size is taken, but multiplied to a larger amount. If an attacker specifies a Content-Length size of 1073741823 or larger, this integer arithmetic will wrap the value back around to smaller integer, then calls \"calloc\" with this size to allocate memory. The following API \"InternetReadFile\" will copy the POST data into this buffer, which will be too small for the contents, and cause heap overflow.\n\n- CVE-2021-32728: The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud Server with a computer. Clients using the Nextcloud end-to-end encryption feature download the public and private key via an API endpoint. In versions prior to 3.3.0, the Nextcloud Desktop client fails to check if a private key belongs to previously downloaded public certificate. If the Nextcloud instance serves a malicious public key, the data would be encrypted for this key and thus could be accessible to a malicious actor. This issue is fixed in Nextcloud Desktop Client version 3.3.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.\n\n- CVE-2021-20327: A specific version of the Node.js mongodb-client-encryption module does not perform correct validation of the KMS server\u2019s certificate. This vulnerability in combination with a privileged network position active MITM attack could result in interception of traffic between the Node.js driver and the KMS service rendering client-side field level encryption (CSFLE) ineffective. This issue was discovered during internal testing and affects mongodb-client-encryption module version 1.2.0, which was available from 2021-Jan-29 and deprecated in the NPM Registry on 2021-Feb-04. This vulnerability does not impact driver traffic payloads with CSFLE-supported key services from applications residing inside the AWS, GCP, and Azure nework fabrics due to compensating controls in these environments. This issue does not impact driver workloads that don\u2019t use Field Level Encryption. This issue affect MongoDB Node.js Driver mongodb-client-encryption module version 1.2.0 \n\n- CVE-2021-20732: The ATOM (ATOM - Smart life App for Android versions prior to 1.8.1 and ATOM - Smart life App for iOS versions prior to 1.8.2) does not verify server certificate properly, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to eavesdrop on encrypted communication via a crafted certificate.\n\n- CVE-2021-20833: The SNKRDUNK Market Place App for iOS versions prior to 2.2.0 does not verify server certificate properly, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to eavesdrop on and/or alter encrypted communication via a crafted certificate.\n\n- CVE-2021-21559: Dell EMC NetWorker, versions 18.x, 19.1.x, 19.2.x 19.3.x, 19.4, and 19.4.0.1 contain an Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in the client (NetWorker Management Console) components which uses SSL encrypted connection in order to communicate with the application server. An unauthenticated attacker in the same network collision domain as the NetWorker Management Console client could potentially exploit this vulnerability to perform man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept and tamper the traffic between the client and the application server.\n\n- CVE-2021-32727: Nextcloud Android Client is the Android client for Nextcloud. Clients using the Nextcloud end-to-end encryption feature download the public and private key via an API endpoint. In versions prior to 3.16.1, the Nextcloud Android client skipped a step that involved the client checking if a private key belonged to a previously downloaded public certificate. If the Nextcloud instance served a malicious public key, the data would be encrypted for this key and thus could be accessible to a malicious actor. The vulnerability is patched in version 3.16.1. As a workaround, do not add additional end-to-end encrypted devices to a user account.\n\n- CVE-2021-3547: OpenVPN 3 Core Library version 3.6 and 3.6.1 allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to bypass the certificate authentication by issuing an unrelated server certificate using the same hostname found in the verify-x509-name option in a client configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-20989: Fibaro Home Center 2 and Lite devices with firmware version 4.600 and older initiate SSH connections to the Fibaro cloud to provide remote access and remote support capabilities. This connection can be intercepted using DNS spoofing attack and a device initiated remote port-forward channel can be used to connect to the web management interface. Knowledge of authorization credentials to the management interface is required to perform any further actions.\n\n- CVE-2020-12053: In Unisys Stealth 3.4.x, 4.x and 5.x before 5.0.026, if certificate-based authorization is used without HTTPS, an endpoint could be authorized without a private key.\n\n- CVE-2021-3162: Docker Desktop Community before 2.5.0.0 on macOS mishandles certificate checking, leading to local privilege escalation.\n\n- CVE-2021-43882: Microsoft Defender for IoT Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2020-0601: A spoofing vulnerability exists in the way Windows CryptoAPI (Crypt32.dll) validates Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) certificates.An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by using a spoofed code-signing certificate to sign a malicious executable, making it appear the file was from a trusted, legitimate source, aka 'Windows CryptoAPI Spoofing Vulnerability'.\n\n- CVE-2021-3935: When PgBouncer is configured to use \"cert\" authentication, a man-in-the-middle attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries when a connection is first established, despite the use of TLS certificate verification and encryption. This flaw affects PgBouncer versions prior to 1.16.1.\n\n- CVE-2022-20703: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Small Business RV160, RV260, RV340, and RV345 Series Routers could allow an attacker to do any of the following: Execute arbitrary code Elevate privileges Execute arbitrary commands Bypass authentication and authorization protections Fetch and run unsigned software Cause denial of service (DoS) For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2022-26923: Active Directory Domain Services Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2022-1632: An Improper Certificate Validation attack was found in Openshift. A re-encrypt Route with destinationCACertificate explicitly set to the default serviceCA skips internal Service TLS certificate validation. This flaw allows an attacker to exploit an invalid certificate, resulting in a loss of confidentiality.\n\n- CVE-2022-29482: 'Mobaoku-Auction&Flea Market' App for iOS versions prior to 5.5.16 improperly verifies server certificates, which may allow an attacker to eavesdrop on an encrypted communication via a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\n- CVE-2022-34156: 'Hulu / ????' App for iOS versions prior to 3.0.81 improperly verifies server certificates, which may allow an attacker to eavesdrop on an encrypted communication via a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\n- CVE-2022-45597: ComponentSpace.Saml2 4.4.0 Missing SSL Certificate Validation. NOTE: the vendor does not consider this a vulnerability because the report is only about use of certificates at the application layer (not the transport layer) and \"Certificates are exchanged in a controlled fashion between entities within a trust relationship. This is why self-signed certificates may be used and why validating certificates isn\u2019t as important as doing so for the transport layer certificates.\"\n\n- CVE-2022-29908: The folioupdate service in Fabasoft Cloud Enterprise Client 22.4.0043 allows Local Privilege Escalation.\n\n- CVE-2021-45035: Velneo vClient on its 28.1.3 version, does not correctly check the certificate of authenticity by default. This could allow an attacker that has access to the network to perform a MITM attack in order to obtain the user\u00b4s credentials.\n\n- CVE-2022-25640: In wolfSSL before 5.2.0, a TLS 1.3 server cannot properly enforce a requirement for mutual authentication. A client can simply omit the certificate_verify message from the handshake, and never present a certificate.\n\n- CVE-2022-31083: Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and 5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new `rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the `rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-287 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-287 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-322 (PeerOf)",

Specifically, these binaries are vulnerable to the following issues: - stack buffer overflow in formRebootCheck due to unsafe copy of submit-url parameter - stack buffer overflow in formWsc due to unsafe copy of submit-url parameter - stack buffer overflow in formWlanMultipleAP due to unsafe copy of submit-url parameter - stack buffer overflow in formWlSiteSurvey due to unsafe copy of ifname parameter - stack buffer overflow in formStaticDHCP due to unsafe copy of hostname parameter - stack buffer overflow in formWsc due to unsafe copy of 'peerPin' parameter - arbitrary command execution in formSysCmd via the sysCmd parameter - arbitrary command injection in formWsc via the 'peerPin' parameter Exploitability of identified issues will differ based on what the end vendor/manufacturer did with the Realtek SDK webserver. Some vendors use it as-is, others add their own authentication implementation, some kept all the features from the server, some remove some of them, some inserted their own set of features. However, given that Realtek SDK implementation is full of insecure calls and that developers tends to re-use those examples in their custom code, any binary based on Realtek SDK webserver will probably contains its own set of issues on top of the Realtek ones (if kept). Successful exploitation of these issues allows remote attackers to gain arbitrary code execution on the device.\n\n- CVE-2021-35474: Stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in cachekey plugin of Apache Traffic Server.

From inspection it is clear that the defect is also present in releases from those series, but they have not been officially tested for the vulnerability), The outcome of encountering the defect while reading a lease that will trigger it varies, according to: the component being affected (i.e., dhclient or dhcpd) whether the package was built as a 32-bit or 64-bit binary whether the compiler flag -fstack-protection-strong was used when compiling In dhclient, ISC has not successfully reproduced the error on a 64-bit system. However, on a 32-bit system it is possible to cause dhclient to crash when reading an improper lease, which could cause network connectivity problems for an affected system due to the absence of a running DHCP client process. In dhcpd, when run in DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 mode: if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 32-bit architecture AND the -fstack-protection-strong flag was specified to the compiler, dhcpd may exit while parsing a lease file containing an objectionable lease, resulting in lack of service to clients. Additionally, the offending lease and the lease immediately following it in the lease database may be improperly deleted. if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 64-bit architecture OR if the -fstack-protection-strong compiler flag was NOT specified, the crash will not occur, but it is possible for the offending lease and the lease which immediately followed it to be improperly deleted.\n\n- CVE-2020-14107: A stack overflow in the HTTP server of Cast can be exploited to make the app crash in LAN.\n\n- CVE-2021-38427: RTI Connext DDS Professional and Connext DDS Secure Versions 4.2.x to 6.1.0 are vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, which may allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n\n- CVE-2021-42529: XMP Toolkit SDK version 2021.07 (and earlier) is affected by a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.

Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may be further mitigated based on stack layout for any given platform/compiler. Pre-announcements of CVE-2022-3602 described this issue as CRITICAL. Further analysis based on some of the mitigating factors described above have led this to be downgraded to HIGH. Users are still encouraged to upgrade to a new version as soon as possible. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.

The implementation of `tf.io.decode_raw` produces incorrect results and crashes the Python interpreter when combining `fixed_length` and wider datatypes. The implementation of the padded version(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc) is buggy due to a confusion about pointer arithmetic rules. First, the code computes(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L61) the width of each output element by dividing the `fixed_length` value to the size of the type argument. The `fixed_length` argument is also used to determine the size needed for the output tensor(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L63-L79). This is followed by reencoding code(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L85-L94). The erroneous code is the last line above: it is moving the `out_data` pointer by `fixed_length * sizeof(T)` bytes whereas it only copied at most `fixed_length` bytes from the input. This results in parts of the input not being decoded into the output. Furthermore, because the pointer advance is far wider than desired, this quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of the backing data. This OOB write leads to interpreter crash in the reproducer mentioned here, but more severe attacks can be mounted too, given that this gadget allows writing to periodically placed locations in memory. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n- CVE-2021-29947: Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 87.

This value may be required as an index into a buffer, a loop iterator, or simply necessary state data. In any case, the value cannot be trusted and the system will be in an undefined state. While this method may be employed viably to isolate the low bits of a value, this usage is rare, and truncation usually implies that an implementation error has occurred.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-17087: Chain: integer truncation (CWE-197) causes small buffer allocation (CWE-131) leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) in kernel pool, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n- CVE-2009-0231: Integer truncation of length value leads to heap-based buffer overflow.\n\n- CVE-2008-3282: Size of a particular type changes for 64-bit platforms, leading to an integer truncation in document processor causes incorrect index to be generated.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-21859: An exploitable integer truncation vulnerability exists within the MPEG-4 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library v1.0.1. The stri_box_read function is used when processing atoms using the 'stri' FOURCC code. An attacker can convince a user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-21860: An exploitable integer truncation vulnerability exists within the MPEG-4 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library v1.0.1. A specially crafted MPEG-4 input can cause an improper memory allocation resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory corruption. The FOURCC code, 'trik', is parsed by the function within the library. An attacker can convince a user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-21861: An exploitable integer truncation vulnerability exists within the MPEG-4 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library v1.0.1. When processing the 'hdlr' FOURCC code, a specially crafted MPEG-4 input can cause an improper memory allocation resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory corruption. An attacker can convince a user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-21862: Multiple exploitable integer truncation vulnerabilities exist within the MPEG-4 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library v1.0.1. A specially crafted MPEG-4 input can cause an improper memory allocation resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory corruption The implementation of the parser used for the \u201cXtra\u201d FOURCC code is handled. An attacker can convince a user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2020-27194: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.8.15. scalar32_min_max_or in kernel/bpf/verifier.c mishandles bounds tracking during use of 64-bit values, aka CID-5b9fbeb75b6a.\n\n- CVE-2020-17087: Windows Kernel Local Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-33742: Windows MSHTML Platform Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2022-34680: NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler, where an integer truncation can lead to an out-of-bounds read, which may lead to denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2022-41873: Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation IoT devices. Versions prior to 4.9 are vulnerable to an Out-of-bounds read. While processing the L2CAP protocol, the Bluetooth Low Energy stack of Contiki-NG needs to map an incoming channel ID to its metadata structure. While looking up the corresponding channel structure in get_channel_for_cid (in os/net/mac/ble/ble-l2cap.c), a bounds check is performed on the incoming channel ID, which is meant to ensure that the channel ID does not exceed the maximum number of supported channels.However, an integer truncation issue leads to only the lowest byte of the channel ID to be checked, which leads to an incomplete out-of-bounds check. A crafted channel ID leads to out-of-bounds memory to be read and written with attacker-controlled data. The vulnerability has been patched in the \"develop\" branch of Contiki-NG, and will be included in release 4.9. As a workaround, Users can apply the patch in Contiki-NG pull request 2081 on GitHub.\n\n- CVE-2022-42324: Oxenstored 32->31 bit integer truncation issues Integers in Ocaml are 63 or 31 bits of signed precision. The Ocaml Xenbus library takes a C uint32_t out of the ring and casts it directly to an Ocaml integer. In 64-bit Ocaml builds this is fine, but in 32-bit builds, it truncates off the most significant bit, and then creates unsigned/signed confusion in the remainder. This in turn can feed a negative value into logic not expecting a negative value, resulting in unexpected exceptions being thrown. The unexpected exception is not handled suitably, creating a busy-loop trying (and failing) to take the bad packet out of the xenstore ring.\n\n- CVE-2022-34169: The Apache Xalan Java XSLT library is vulnerable to an integer truncation issue when processing malicious XSLT stylesheets. This can be used to corrupt Java class files generated by the internal XSLTC compiler and execute arbitrary Java bytecode. Users are recommended to update to version 2.7.3 or later. Note: Java runtimes (such as OpenJDK) include repackaged copies of Xalan.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-681 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-681 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-681 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-195 (CanAlsoBe)\n\n- CWE-196 (CanAlsoBe)\n\n- CWE-192 (CanAlsoBe)\n\n- CWE-194 (CanAlsoBe)",
