The access control configuration permits Linux to read key registers in TCSR, which can be viewed as a form of authorization bypass where a user can control the key to gain access to sensitive information. |\n| CWE-1394 | Use of Default Cryptographic Key | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. While not explicitly stated, the vulnerability could potentially involve the use of default cryptographic keys if the key registers are accessible due to the access control misconfiguration. |\n| CWE-312 | Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. If the key registers are being read, the keys might be stored in cleartext, representing a potential vulnerability. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE identified is CWE-639, which focuses on authorization bypass through user-controlled keys. This is a base-level CWE, offering a specific characterization of the vulnerability.

The primary CWE, CWE-639, is selected because it directly addresses the authorization bypass aspect. The secondary CWEs, CWE-1394 and CWE-312, are considered based on potential implications of the vulnerability, such as the use of default keys or cleartext storage.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is limited, focusing on the access control misconfiguration and the ability to read key registers. This evidence supports the selection of CWE-639.\n\nThe CWEs are selected at the base level of abstraction to provide a specific characterization of the vulnerability.\nThe retriever results also suggest some cryptographic key related CWEs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n*   CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n*   CWE-1394: Use of Default Cryptographic Key\n*   CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information",
