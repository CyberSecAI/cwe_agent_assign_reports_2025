## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE Content

The provided content relates to **CVE-2025-3205** as it details a SQL injection vulnerability in "codeastro Student Grading System in PHP with Source Code v1.0" specifically within the `studentsubject.php` file. The GitHub issue report provides a detailed description of the vulnerability, its root cause, impact, and proof-of-concept (POC) exploits.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient user input validation for the "studentId" parameter. The application directly uses the parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   System control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable via the `studentId` GET parameter in `studentsubject.php`.
*   Exploitation methods include:
    *   Boolean-based blind SQL injection
    *   Error-based SQL injection
    *   Time-based blind SQL injection
    *   UNION query SQL injection

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.
*   **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.
*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the least necessary privileges.
*   **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**
