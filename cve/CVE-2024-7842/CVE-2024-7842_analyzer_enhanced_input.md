### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** information disclosure
- **product:** Online Graduate Tracer System
- **version:** 1
- **component:** /tracking/admin/export_it.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control in the `export_it.php` file within the Online Graduate Tracer System. This allows unauthenticated users to directly access the file and download sensitive user information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive user data.
*   **Missing Authentication/Authorization:** The lack of proper authentication or authorization checks on `export_it.php` is the core weakness that enables the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can obtain user information such as names, phone numbers, addresses, and possibly other personal details from the system. This information could be used for malicious purposes, including identity theft, phishing, or further targeted attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct Access:** The attack vector is very simple: an unauthenticated user directly accessing the vulnerable URL (`/tracking/admin/export_it.php`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have any account or login credentials.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must know the specific URL of the vulnerable file (`/tracking/admin/export_it.php`).

**Additional Details:**
* The provided content gives specific details about the vulnerable file `/tracking/admin/export_it.php`, which is not present in the official CVE description.
* The provided content also includes a PoC (Proof of Concept), detailing how to exploit the vulnerability: "Visit admin/export_it.php Access this route directly without logging in to download personal information".
