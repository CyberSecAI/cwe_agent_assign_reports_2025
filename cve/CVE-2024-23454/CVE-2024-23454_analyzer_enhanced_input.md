## Vulnerability Description
Apache Hadoops RunJar.run() does not set permissions for temporary directory by default. If sensitive data will be present in this file, all the other local users may be able to view the content. This is because, on unix-like systems, the system temporary directory is shared between all local users. As such, files written in this directory, without setting the correct posix permissions explicitly, may be viewable by all other local users.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper permissions**
- **impact:** view sensitive data
- **attacker:** local users
- **product:** Apache Hadoop
- **component:** RunJar.run()

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-23454:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from Apache Hadoop's `RunJar.run()` method not setting proper permissions on temporary directories by default. Specifically, it fails to set specific POSIX permissions when creating temporary files in a shared system directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The core weakness is the creation of temporary files in a shared directory (`/tmp` on Unix-like systems) without setting restrictive permissions.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Because the permissions are not set correctly, other local users can potentially read the contents of these temporary files if sensitive data is present.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows local users to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information that might be stored in temporary files created by Hadoop's `RunJar.run()` method.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local access to the affected system, because the vulnerability affects how temporary files are created and accessed by different local users on the same system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the same system where the vulnerable Hadoop instance is running.
*   **No Elevated Privileges Required:** The attacker doesn't require any special privileges or elevated access to exploit the vulnerability because the issue is related to the shared file system permissions and that the files are readable by other users.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Apache Hadoop versions prior to 3.4.0 are affected.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is resolved in Hadoop versions 3.4.0 and 3.5.0.
*   **NetApp's Stance:** NetApp has acknowledged the vulnerability in its products but states that none of its products are affected. This likely means that either they don't use the vulnerable part of Hadoop or have implemented mitigations.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability is rated as 6.2 (MEDIUM) with a vector of `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N`.

In summary, CVE-2024-23454 is a local information disclosure vulnerability in Apache Hadoop due to insecure temporary file creation.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
