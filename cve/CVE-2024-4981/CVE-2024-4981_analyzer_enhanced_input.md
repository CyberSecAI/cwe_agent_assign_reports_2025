## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was discovered in Pagure server. If a malicious user were to submit a git repository with symbolic links, the server could unintentionally show incorporate and make visible content from outside the git repo.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** show incorporate and make visible content from outside the git repo
- **vector:** submit a git repository with symbolic links
- **attacker:** malicious user
- **product:** Pagure server

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2024-4981 based on provided content:

The provided content contains information directly related to CVE-2024-4981. Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details extracted from the analyzed sources:

**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `_update_file_in_git()` method in `pagure/lib/git.py` does not adequately check if a file path, when resolving symbolic links, remains within the temporary clone directory. This allows attackers to potentially write data to arbitrary locations on the server.

**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Symbolic Link Following:** The code follows symbolic links without verifying that the resolved path remains within the intended temporary directory.
*   **Path Traversal:** This allows for a path traversal vulnerability, where an attacker can potentially write files outside the temporary directory.

**3. Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation could allow attackers to write fully controlled data to arbitrary paths on the server, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. The proof-of-concept involved overriding `/srv/git/.bashrc` on a test server.

**4. Attack vectors:**

1.  Create a repository on a Pagure instance.
2.  Clone the repository locally.
3.  Create a symbolic link pointing to a location outside the temporary clone directory.
4.  Commit and push the symbolic link to Pagure.
5.  Use the web interface to edit the file (the symbolic link).
6.  Commit the changes, which will write data to the target location of the symbolic link on the server.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to create a repository and push commits to it.
*   The attacker needs to be able to use the web interface to edit files within the repository.
*   The system user `git` needs write permissions to the target location of the symbolic link.

**6. Mitigation or fix:**

The vulnerability was fixed by adding checks to ensure that the resolved file path after following symbolic links remains within the temporary repository directory and is not inside the `.git/` folder. The fix is implemented in commit `454f267` and addresses Red Hat Bugzilla reports #2278745, #2280725, and #2280723.

**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Thomas Chauchefoin.
*   The fix includes a signed-off-by line from Dominik Wombacher.
*   The fix explicitly mentions preventing data leaks and unauthorized changes to files or git configuration.
*   The provided content includes links to the commit, patch, and file changes.
*   The bug was reported via Red Hat Bugzilla #2278745.
