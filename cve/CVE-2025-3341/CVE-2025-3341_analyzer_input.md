## Analysis of CVE-2025-3341 Content

This content **RELATES** to a vulnerability, but it's not directly tied to a CVE with that ID (as the CVE description is a placeholder). It details a SQL injection vulnerability in "Restaurant Management System Project V1.0".  It provides more detail than a typical CVE description.

Here's the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient user input validation of the 'id' parameter in `/admin/reservation_view.php?id=45`. The application directly uses the 'id' parameter in SQL queries without proper cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering
*   Comprehensive system control
*   Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**

*   HTTP GET request to `/admin/reservation_view.php?id=45` with a malicious 'id' parameter.
*   No login or authorization is required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Unauthenticated attacker with network access to the application.
*   Ability to craft malicious SQL queries.

**Mitigation or fix:**

1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:**  Separate SQL code from user input data.
2.  **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input.
3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** Use accounts with the minimum necessary permissions.
4.  **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.

**Payload Examples (from sqlmap):**

The content includes several SQLmap payloads for different types of SQL injection attacks:

*   Boolean-based blind
*   Error-based
*   Time-based blind
*   UNION query
