  "description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An **integer underflow** has been detected in qtdemux_parse_trak function within qtdemux.c. During the strf parsing case, the subtraction size -= 40 can lead to a negative **integer overflow** if it is less than 40. If this happens, the subsequent call to gst_buffer_fill will invoke memcpy with a large tocopy size, resulting in an OOB-read. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-47545\n\n**Root Cause:** An integer underflow vulnerability exists in the `qtdemux_parse_trak` function within `qtdemux.c` when parsing the `strf` FOURCC. Specifically, the subtraction `size -= 40` can result in a negative integer value if `size` is less than 40. This negative value is then used in a subsequent call to `gst_buffer_fill`, leading to an out-of-bounds read.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n- Integer underflow: The subtraction `size -= 40` can result in a negative integer due to insufficient size.\n- Out-of-bounds read: The negative size is used in `gst_buffer_fill`, leading to a `memcpy` with a large `tocopy` size, resulting in reading out of the bounds of the allocated buffer.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- A malicious third party can trigger this vulnerability by crafting an input file that results in the aforementioned integer underflow and out-of-bounds read.\n- This can lead to a crash of the application due to a segmentation fault when accessing invalid memory, or potentially reading up to 4GB of process memory.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Malicious MP4/MOV input file: A specially crafted file containing a `strf` atom with insufficient size data triggers the vulnerability.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to provide a malicious MP4/MOV file to a vulnerable application using GStreamer.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability is located in the `gst-plugins-good` component of GStreamer.\n- The fix involves ensuring that the `size` value is not less than 40 before subtraction.\n- The vulnerability was reported by Antonio Morales of the GitHub Security Lab.\n- Affected versions of GStreamer are `gst-plugins-good` prior to version `1.24.10`.\n- The issue was assigned `GHSL-2024-242` by the GitHub Security Lab.",
