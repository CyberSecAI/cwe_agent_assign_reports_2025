  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-55548:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation on the password field of user accounts. Specifically, the web interface does not enforce a maximum length for passwords, allowing users to set passwords exceeding 16 characters.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Setting a password longer than 16 characters causes the device to enter a denial-of-service state, rendering its web interface unusable.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Denial of Service:** The primary impact is a denial of service, preventing legitimate users from accessing and managing the device through its web interface.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered through the device's web interface.\n*   **Password Setting:** An attacker must set an overly long password (more than 16 characters) for a user account.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a user on the device's web interface.\n*   **Bypass Length Check:** The attacker must be able to bypass or disable the client-side or server-side length check on the password field. This is mentioned as \"disabling the length check in the input fields\".\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe CVE-2024-55548 vulnerability is a Denial-of-Service (DoS) issue arising from the lack of input validation on the web interface when setting user passwords. By setting a password longer than 16 characters, an authenticated attacker can cause the device to enter a DoS state, making the web interface inaccessible. The exploit requires prior authentication and the ability to bypass input field length restrictions.",

In this case, the quantity is the length of the password. There is a potential for a chain relationship where CWE-1284 can lead to CWE-400, **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption**, because the excessive password length could lead to denial of service by consuming too many resources when processed.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n\n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe400\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1284 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper validation of the password length** (CWE-1284). This leads to the ability to set an excessively long password, which then results in a denial-of-service condition, potentially due to **uncontrolled resource consumption** (CWE-400) when the system attempts to process the oversized password.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis indicates that **CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input)** is the most appropriate primary CWE. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **improper check of password character length**. This aligns directly with the CWE description, which focuses on the failure to validate or incorrectly validating that a quantity (in this case, password length) has the required properties.\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating: \"The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation on the password field of user accounts. Specifically, the web interface does not enforce a maximum length for passwords, allowing users to set passwords exceeding 16 characters.\"\n\nCWE-400 is considered as a secondary candidate because the consequence of **improper validation** leads to a denial-of-service condition.\n\nThe final CWE selection is based on the evidence provided, the relationship analysis, and the goal of selecting the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is not about the implementation of the authentication algorithm itself, but rather about input validation.*\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is not about the strength of the credentials themselves, but about the lack of validation on the password length.*\n\n## CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is not about hard-coded credentials, but about the lack of validation on the password length.*\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is not about bypassing authentication, but about the lack of validation on the password length after authentication.*\n\n## CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication algorithm is sound, but the implemented mechanism can be bypassed as the result of a separate weakness that is primary to the authentication error.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is not about bypassing authentication, but about the lack of validation on the password length after authentication.*\n\n## CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not implement sufficient measures to prevent multiple failed authentication attempts within a short time frame.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is not about excessive authentication attempts, but about the lack of validation on the password length.*\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*This CWE is not specific enough.
