  "vulnerability_info": "VulnerabilityInfo(cve_id='CVE-2025-27774', description='Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.7 and prior are vulnerable to **server-side request forgery** (SSRF) and file write in `model_download.py` (line 156 in 3.2.7). The **blind SSRF** allows for sending requests on behalf of Applio server and can be leveraged to probe for other vulnerabilities on the server itself or on other back-end systems on the internal network, that the Applio server can reach. The **blind SSRF** can also be coupled with the an arbitrary file read (e.g., CVE-2025-27784) to read files from hosts on the internal network, that the Applio server can reach, which would make it a full SSRF. The file write allows for writing files on the server, which can be coupled with other vulnerabilities, for example an unsafe **deserialization**, to achieve remote code execution on the Applio server. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.', key_phrases={'rootcause': '', 'weakness': ['server-side request forgery', 'deserialization', 'blind SSRF'], 'impact': ['remote code execution', 'arbitrary file read', 'read files'], 'vector': '', 'attacker': '', 'product': 'Applio', 'version': '3.2.7 and prior', 'component': 'model_download.py'}, reference_content=\"Here's an analysis of the provided content, focusing on CVE-2025-27774:\\n\\n**CVE-2025-27774**\\n\\n*   **Content:** securitylab.github.com\\\\_fc604152\\\\_20250624\\\\_200153.html\\n*   **Relevance:** The content is directly related to CVE-2025-27774 because it describes the vulnerability GHSL-2024-341, which has been assigned to this CVE ID. It also details the other vulnerabilities found in the Applio project.\\n*   **Extracted Information:**\\n    *   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the Applio application's handling of user-supplied URLs in the `model_download.py` file. Specifically, lines 194 in `download.py` and line 14 in `routes.py` take user-supplied URLs and use them to make HTTP GET requests in `model_download.py` (line 143).\\n    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and arbitrary file write.\\n    *   **Impact of exploitation:** The blind SSRF allows sending requests on behalf of the Applio server, potentially probing internal network vulnerabilities. Coupled with the file write capability, an attacker can write files on the server, potentially leading to remote code execution by combining it with other vulnerabilities like unsafe deserialization.\\n    *   **Attack vectors:** An attacker can provide a malicious URL to the endpoints in `download.py` and `routes.py`.\\n    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious URL that the Applio server will then fetch.\\n    *   **Mitigation or fix:** The content does not contain this information.\\n*   **More detail than the official CVE description:** Yes. The content provides specific file names, line numbers, and code snippets related to the vulnerability within the Applio project.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '',

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.7 and prior are vulnerable to **server-side request forgery** (SSRF) and file write in `model_download.py` (line 156 in 3.2.7). The **blind SSRF** allows for sending requests on behalf of Applio server and can be leveraged to probe for other vulnerabilities on the server itself or on other back-end systems on the internal network, that the Applio server can reach. The **blind SSRF** can also be coupled with the an arbitrary file read (e.g., CVE-2025-27784) to read files from hosts on the internal network, that the Applio server can reach, which would make it a full SSRF. The file write allows for writing files on the server, which can be coupled with other vulnerabilities, for example an unsafe **deserialization**, to achieve remote code execution on the Applio server. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## WEAKNESS: 'server-side request forgery'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:\n\n### 1.
