## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's an analysis of the provided content based on your guidelines:

The content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in CicadasCMS v1.0. It provides detailed information exceeding the typical CVE description:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `orderField` and `orderDirection` parameters of the `/system/cms/content/page` interface are concatenated into the `order by` clause without validation or filtering.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can construct special SQL statements to steal sensitive data from the database. The content specifically demonstrates a 5-second delay using `sleep(0.01)`, confirming the vulnerability, and demonstrates how to determine the database name using the fuzzing technique.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted POST requests to the `/system/cms/content/page` interface, manipulating the `orderField` and `orderDirection` parameters.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests and to know the admin backend login.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** The content suggests to validate and filter user inputs to prevent SQL injection attacks.
*   **Additional detail:** The content includes the code location, related methods, and detailed request examples. It also provides proof of concept using time-based SQL injection, and demonstrates how to fuzz for additional information, like the database name.
