# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-47127

## Vulnerability Description
In the goTenna Pro App there is a vulnerability that makes it possible to inject any custom message with any GID and Callsign using a software defined radio in existing goTenna mesh networks. This vulnerability can be exploited if the device is being used in an unencrypted environment or if the cryptography has already been compromised. It is advised to share encryption keys via QR scanning for higher security operations and update your app to the current release for enhanced encryption protocols.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** inject custom messages
- **vector:** software defined radio
- **product:** goTenna Pro App

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The goTenna Pro App has a weakness that allows for injection of custom messages with arbitrary GID and Callsign due to weak authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Weak authentication mechanisms.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary messages within an existing goTenna mesh network. This could lead to disruption of communication, misinformation, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can use a software-defined radio to inject messages into the goTenna mesh network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be within radio range of a goTenna mesh network and have the ability to send custom RF signals with a software-defined radio. The vulnerability can be exploited if the network is unencrypted or if the encryption is already compromised.
