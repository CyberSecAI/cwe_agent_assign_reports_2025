The FtpFileObject class can throw an exception when a file is not found, revealing the original URI in its message, which may include a password.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe content from `lists.apache.org_7760fb1b_20250624_173634.html` and `www.openwall.com_ff0141a7_20250624_205948.html` directly relates to CVE-2025-30474.  The email from Gary D. Gregory details the vulnerability, affected versions, and a fix.\n\n**Extracted Information:**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `FtpFileObject` class throws an exception that includes the original URI when a file is not found. This URI may contain a password.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of sensitive information (passwords) in error messages.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized disclosure of passwords used in FTP URIs.\n*   **Attack vectors:**  Attempting to access a non-existent file via FTP using a URI containing a password.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to trigger an attempt to access a file via FTP with a password in the URI.  No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability, only the ability to initiate the connection.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** Upgrade to Apache Commons VFS version 2.10.0 or later, which masks the password in the exception message.\n*   **Credit:** Marek \u0160unda (finder)\n*   **References:**\n    *   [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/VFS-169](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/VFS-169)\n    *   [https://commons.apache.org/](https://commons.apache.org/)\n    *   [https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30474](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30474)\n\n**Other Content:**\n\nThe other provided content (from `commons.apache.org`, `issues.apache.org`, and `lists.openwall.net`) is either general information about Apache Commons, the issue tracker, or mailing list archives and is not directly related to the specifics of the vulnerability itself.\n\n**Detail compared to official CVE description:**\n\nThe provided content *is* the detailed description of the vulnerability. It provides more detail than a typical CVE description would, including the specific class involved (`FtpFileObject`) and the nature of the fix (masking the password).",

CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE and is too general. CWE-209 is related to CWE-200 as it can lead to the exposure of sensitive information. The vulnerability chain starts with the generation of an error message containing sensitive information, leading to the exposure of that information to an unauthorized actor.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe209[\"CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n\n    cwe209 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe209 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper** generation of an error message that includes sensitive information (CWE-209). This leads to the **exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor** (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-200 as a potential candidate due to the \"**Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**\" vulnerability description key phrase. However, based on the detailed analysis of the vulnerability description, the root cause is the generation of an error message containing sensitive information, which is accurately represented by CWE-209.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"The FtpFileObject class can throw an exception when a file is not found, revealing the original URI in its message, which may include a password.\" This clearly indicates that the error message itself contains the sensitive information. The fix is to mask the password in the exception message, which further supports the selection of CWE-209.\n\nCWE-200 is a more general classification of the impact, while CWE-209 captures the specific root cause. Therefore, CWE-209 is the optimal choice for the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
