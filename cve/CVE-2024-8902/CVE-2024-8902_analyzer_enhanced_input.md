## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8902:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The provided content from wordfence.com directly references **CVE-2024-8902** and describes a vulnerability in the "Elementor Addon Elements plugin for WordPress".
   - The description aligns with the plugin's name in the provided changeset content, which confirms its relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The root cause lies in the `render_column` function within the `modules/data-table/widgets/data-table.php` file of the Elementor Addon Elements plugin.
   - This function, when rendering table cells based on a template, does not properly restrict access to the template data.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The vulnerability exposes sensitive information, specifically private, pending, and draft template data, to unauthorized actors.
   - **Lack of Access Control:** The code lacks proper access controls on the template data, leading to the exposure.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Data Leakage:** Attackers can gain access to potentially sensitive template content that should not be available to them.
   - **Unauthorized Access to Drafts/Private Content:** Attackers can access data which is not intended to be publicly available, including internal data/templates not published yet.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Network-based:** The vulnerability is reachable via a network connection.
   - **Authenticated:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with Contributor-level access or higher in order to exploit this.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **WordPress Contributor+ Access:** The attacker needs to have at least Contributor level access to the WordPress site.
   - **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** All versions up to and including 1.13.8 are affected.
*   **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.13.9.
*   **Patch Location:** The fix is in changeset [3163899](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3163899/addon-elements-for-elementor-page-builder)
*   **Fix:** The fix appears to involve checking for the 'publish' status of the template before rendering it, which adds a basic form of access control. The code also introduces a `template` variable to be used in the `get_builder_content` calls, instead of directly using the data array values.
*   **Wordfence Detection:** Wordfence has added a rule to detect this vulnerability.

**Summary:**

CVE-2024-8902 is a medium severity authenticated sensitive information exposure vulnerability in the Elementor Addon Elements plugin. It allows a user with Contributor-level access or higher to obtain unauthorized access to template data. The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.13.9. The root cause is improper access control in the `render_column` function.
