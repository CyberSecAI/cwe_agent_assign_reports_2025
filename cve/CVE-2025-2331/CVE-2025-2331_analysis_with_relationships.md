# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Primary CWE | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor | 0.7 | Class | Secondary Candidate CWE | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the decision is the hierarchical relationship between CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and its potential base-level children, as well as the relationship to CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor). While CWE-863 is a Class-level CWE, the description indicates a **misconfigured capability check**, implying that an authorization check was performed, but incorrectly. CWE-200 describes the impact of the vulnerability, which is the exposure of sensitive information.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **misconfigured capability check** (Incorrect Authorization), which then leads to the **Sensitive Information Exposure**.

*   **Root Cause:** CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization - A **misconfigured capability check** allows unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor - Attackers can extract sensitive data.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **misconfigured capability check**. The Retriever Results pointed to CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) as potential candidates. Given that the vulnerability description specifies a **misconfigured** check rather than a complete absence of a check, CWE-863 was chosen as the primary CWE. The evidence supporting this decision is the phrase **misconfigured capability check** in the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases".

CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) was considered as a secondary CWE because it represents the impact of the vulnerability. The attackers were able to extract sensitive data including reports detailing donors and donation amounts.

The selection of CWE-863 and CWE-200 as the optimal level of specificity is based on the available evidence and the CWE specifications. While more specific base-level CWEs could potentially exist under CWE-863, the current description does not provide enough detail to warrant a more precise classification.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

*Not Selected:* This vulnerability does not appear to be a CSRF vulnerability. There is no evidence to indicate the attacker is forcing the victim to perform actions against their will.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* Although related to authorization issues, the description mentions a **misconfigured capability check**, rather than a complete lack of authorization enforcement.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* The vulnerability is about a **misconfigured capability check** and not about external control of web parameters.

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* This vulnerability is not related to file uploads.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* While this could be considered, the **misconfigured capability check** is more descriptive of what happened.

## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* This vulnerability is not about the insertion of sensitive information.

## CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* This is similar to CWE-200 and CWE-863, but not as accurate.

## CWE-862: Missing Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

*Not Selected:* The vulnerability description indicates a **misconfigured capability check**, meaning that authorization was attempted, but it was implemented incorrectly.

## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* The root cause is incorrect authorization.

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

*Not Selected:* This is not about removing sensitive information.
