  "reference_content": "## CVE-2025-2374 Analysis - Relevant Content Found\n\nThe following information is extracted from the provided content, relating to a SQL injection vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe `mobilenumber` parameter in `profile.php` is not filtered, allowing direct execution of time-based SQL injection.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nThe impact is not explicitly stated, but SQL injection vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches, modification, or deletion, and potentially compromise the entire database.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is exploitable through the `mobilenumber` parameter in the `profile.php` file.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to submit a crafted input to the `mobilenumber` parameter. This likely requires access to the profile editing functionality.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input.\n2.  **Input validation and filtering:** Strictly validate and filter user input to ensure it conforms to the expected format.\n3.  **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   **Affected Product:** Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) \u2013 Testing Management System\n*   **Vendor Homepage:** [https://phpgurukul.com/human-metapneumovirus-hmpv-testing-management-system-using-php-and-mysql/](https://phpgurukul.com/human-metapneumovirus-hmpv-testing-management-system-using-php-and-mysql/)\n*   **Vulnerable File:** `/profile.php`\n*   **Version:** V1.0\n*   **Software Link:** [https://phpgurukul.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/HMPV-Testing-Management-System-PHP.zip](https://phpgurukul.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/HMPV-Testing-Management-System-PHP.zip)\n*   The vulnerable code snippet is provided:\n\n```\nif (strlen($_SESSION['aid']==0)) {\n  header('location:logout.php');\n  } else{\n\n    if(isset($_POST['update']))\n  {\n    $adminid=$_SESSION['aid'];\n    $aname=$_POST['adminname'];\n  $mobno=$_POST['mobilenumber'];\n  $email=$_POST['email'];\n\n     $query=mysqli_query($con, \"update tbladmin set AdminName='$aname', MobileNumber ='$mobno', Email= '$email' where ID='$adminid'\");\n    if ($query) {\n\n    echo '<script>alert(\"Profile has been updated\")</script>';\n  }\n```",

The vulnerability description explicitly states that manipulation of arguments leads to **SQL injection**. The CVE reference confirms this by stating the root cause is that the `mobilenumber` parameter in `profile.php` is not filtered, allowing direct execution of time-based SQL injection.\n\nThe retriever results further support this by listing CWE-89 as the top candidate with a score of 1.0.\n\nThe chosen CWE is at the Base level of abstraction, which is appropriate for the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
