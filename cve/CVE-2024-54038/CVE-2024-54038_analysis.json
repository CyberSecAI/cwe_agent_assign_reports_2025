The retriever results also list several Class-level CWEs related to authorization and authentication, such as CWE-285, CWE-863, and CWE-287. However, based on the provided description, the root cause isn't specific enough to pinpoint whether the issue lies in authentication or authorization, making the broader CWE-284 the most appropriate choice. The guidance \"If the access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced, but it's not due to missing checks, consider CWE-284\" supports this selection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe284 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single point:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper Access Control** (CWE-284) leading to a security feature bypass.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment identified **Improper Access Control** as the root cause, which aligns with the provided vulnerability description key phrases. The retriever results suggested several related CWEs, particularly those involving authentication and authorization. However, the vulnerability description lacks the specificity to determine whether the **improper access control** stems from missing authentication (CWE-306), missing authorization (CWE-862), or incorrect authorization (CWE-863).\n\nThe decision to assign CWE-284 is based on the following evidence from the vulnerability description and guidance:\n\n*   \"Adobe Connect versions 12.6, 11.4.7 and earlier are affected by an **Improper Access Control** vulnerability that could result in a Security feature bypass.\"\n*   The guidance \"If the access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced, but it's not due to missing checks, consider CWE-284.\"\n*   The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms \"Improper Access Control (CWE-284)\" as the root cause.\n\nCWE-284 is selected because it is a general, high-level category.

The retriever results also list several Class-level CWEs related to authorization and authentication, such as CWE-285, CWE-863, and CWE-287. However, based on the provided description, the root cause isn't specific enough to pinpoint whether the issue lies in authentication or authorization, making the broader CWE-284 the most appropriate choice. The guidance \"If the access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced, but it's not due to missing checks, consider CWE-284\" supports this selection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe284 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single point:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper Access Control** (CWE-284) leading to a security feature bypass.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment identified **Improper Access Control** as the root cause, which aligns with the provided vulnerability description key phrases. The retriever results suggested several related CWEs, particularly those involving authentication and authorization.
