  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-5098 - Mobile Dynamix PrinterShare Mobile Print Gmail Oauth Token Disclosure\n\nThis content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2025-5098. It provides a detailed advisory regarding a Gmail OAuth token disclosure vulnerability in the PrinterShare Mobile Print application. Here's an extraction of the relevant information:\n\n**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the insecure storage and reuse of Gmail authentication tokens within the PrinterShare application. Specifically, the OAuth token is stored in plaintext and is reintroduced in multiple activities (ActivityGmail.java and ActivityGmailConversation.java), allowing an attacker to capture and reuse it.\n\n**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor:** The Gmail OAuth token, a sensitive credential, is exposed.\n*   **CWE-313: Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk:** The token is stored in plaintext within the application's memory.\n*   **Insecure Activity Interaction:** The target Activity is exported as true, allowing any application with appropriate permissions to interact with it.\n\n**3. Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation allows an attacker to capture the user's Gmail authentication token and use it to access their Gmail account without proper authorization, compromising the confidentiality of the inbox.\n\n**4. Attack vectors:**\n\n*   An attacker can attach the device email to the application by opening the application and clicking 'Gmail', then choosing the account.\n*   Using tools like Frida to hook into the application's code and intercept the token during authentication.\n*   Exploiting the exported Activity to interact with the application and capture the token.\n\n**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs access to the target Android device.\n*   Root access to the device is mentioned in the technical description (Android 13 aarch64 - Samsung Rooted), but it's not explicitly stated as a requirement for the exploit itself. Frida server requires root access.\n*   Knowledge of Frida and Android application debugging is required to utilize the provided proof-of-concept exploit script.\n*   Ability to install and run Frida client on a separate machine (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS in the example).\n\n**6. Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   As of the publication date (2025-05-22), no response from the vendor was received, and no known mitigations are available to end-users.\n\n**Additional Details (more detail than the official CVE description):**\n\n*   **Affected Versions:** Up to version 12.15.01\n*   **Platform:** Android\n*   **Specific Code Locations:** The vulnerability is present in `ActivityGmail.java` and `ActivityGmailConversation.java`. Specific code snippets demonstrating the token leakage are provided.\n*   **Proof of Concept:** A Frida script (`exploit.js`) is included, demonstrating how to capture the token and access Gmail inbox data.\n*   **Disclosure Timeline:** Details of the vulnerability disclosure process are provided, including dates of contact attempts and public disclosure.\n*   **Technical Setup:** The advisory details the specific environment used for testing (Android 13, Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 Lite, Frida client on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS).",

CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor) is a consequence of the token being stored insecurely. While authentication is mentioned, the core issue lies in the **insecure storage** of already obtained authentication tokens. Thus, CWE-306 is considered, as reuse of the token bypasses normal login mechanisms.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe313[\"CWE-313: Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe313\n    cwe306 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe313\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe313 primary\n    class cwe200,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with:\n1.  **CWE-313**: The Gmail OAuth token is stored in plaintext within the application's memory. This is the **root cause**.\n2.  **CWE-200**: This leads to the exposure of the Gmail OAuth token, a sensitive credential.\n3.  **CWE-306**: The exposed token, once captured, allows an attacker to bypass authentication and access the user's Gmail account. This highlights the missing authentication for the Gmail account access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which gives a detailed explanation of the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The primary issue is the **insecure storage** of the Gmail OAuth token (CWE-313). The exposure of this sensitive information (CWE-200) is a direct result of the **insecure storage**.\n\nThe relationship graph influenced the selection by visualizing the flow from **insecure storage** to information exposure and subsequent bypass of authentication. CWE-313 is the optimal level of specificity, accurately representing the weakness of storing sensitive information in plaintext.\n\nThe provided evidence strongly supports the identification of CWE-313 as the primary weakness, with CWE-200 as a secondary weakness resulting from the primary issue. CWE-306 is also considered as a secondary weakness, given the use of the token to bypass normal login mechanisms.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
