The root cause is the **missing authorization** check (CWE-862).\n\nEvidence:\n*   \"The PPWP Password Protect Pages plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Sensitive Information Exposure**... This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data from posts that have been restricted...\"\n*   \"Root cause of vulnerability: The plugin **fails to properly restrict access** to password-protected content when using the WordPress core search feature.\"\n\nCWE-200 is selected because the description explicitly states **\"Sensitive Information Exposure\"**. CWE-862 is also selected because the root cause indicates the plugin \"**fails to properly restrict access**\", which implies a **missing authorization** check.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n*   CWE-285 Improper Authorization: While related to authorization, CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is more specific and directly reflects the root cause described in the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization: It is not clear if the plugin performs an authorization check incorrectly, or does not perform any at all. CWE-862 more accurately describes the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function: Although authentication might be related, the core issue is that content restricted to higher-level roles is accessible to unauthenticated users, pointing to a **missing authorization** check after authentication (or lack thereof).\n*   CWE-425 Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'): This is a broader category. While the WordPress core search feature could be considered a direct request, the **underlying issue** is the **missing authorization** check.\n*   CWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key: There is no evidence of a user-controlled key being manipulated to bypass authorization.\n*   CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'): There is no evidence of XSS.\n*   CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): There is no evidence of CSRF.\n*   CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type: There is no evidence of file uploads.\n*   CWE-472 External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter: There is no evidence that external control of parameters leads to the vulnerability.\n*   CWE-538 Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory: There is no mention of files or directories.\n*   CWE-497 Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere: This is about system information, but the vulnerability description refers to data from posts.",
