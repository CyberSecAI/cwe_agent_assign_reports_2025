  "description": "A vulnerability was identified in the NVDA Remote (version 2.6.4) and Tele NVDA Remote (version 2025.3.3) remote connection add-ons, which allows an attacker to obtain total control of the remote system by guessing a weak password. The problem occurs because these add-ons accept any password entered by the user and do not have an additional authentication or computer verification mechanism. Tests indicate that more than 1,000 systems use easy-to-guess passwords, many with less than 4 to 6 characters, including common sequences. This allows brute force attacks or trial-and-error attempts by malicious invaders. The vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker who knows or can guess the password used in the connection. As a result, the attacker gains complete access to the affected system and can execute commands, modify files, and compromise user security.",

The vulnerability description mentions guessing a weak password, which is directly related to the use of weak credentials. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-306, which indicates a complete lack of authentication. CWE-1391 describes the use of weak credentials, which is a contributing factor. These CWEs are related in that the absence of proper authentication mechanisms allows weak credentials to be exploited.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe1391[\"CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\"]\n\n    cwe1391 -->|CANBEEXPLOITEDBY| cwe306\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe1391 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authentication** (CWE-306), which allows the use of **weak credentials** (CWE-1391). The attacker exploits this by guessing the weak password, leading to complete control of the remote system, execution of commands, modification of files, and compromise of user security.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary focus of this vulnerability is the **lack of authentication** for critical functions, which is accurately represented by CWE-306. The add-ons accept any password entered by the user without any additional checks. While the use of weak passwords is a contributing factor, the root cause is the absence of authentication.\n\nThe CWE-306 description matches the vulnerability perfectly: \"The product does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.\"\n\nThe vulnerability description key phrases include: \"**accepts any password entered**,\" which directly supports the missing authentication aspect.\n\nThe CVE reference links content summary states: \"The remote connection add-ons accept any password without additional authentication or verification mechanisms,\" reinforcing the choice of CWE-306.\n\nCWE-1391 is a valid secondary consideration because the vulnerability highlights the fact that these add-ons accept any password, including weak ones.
