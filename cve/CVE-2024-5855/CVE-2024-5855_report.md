# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-5855

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-5855

## Description

The Media Hygiene Remove or Delete Unused Images and More! plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a **missing capability check** on the bulk_action_delete and delete_single_image_call AJAX actions in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary attachments. A nonce check was added in version 3.0.1, however, it wasnt until version 3.0.2 that a capability check was added.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** missing capability check
- **Impact:** unauthorized loss of data
- **Attacker:** authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access and above
- **Product:** Media Hygiene Remove or Delete Unused Images and More! plugin for WordPress
- **Version:** up to and including 3.0.1
- **Component:** bulk_action_delete and delete_single_image_call AJAX actions

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 1.0 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Primary CWE: The plugin **does not perform an authorization check** when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. |
| CWE-425 | Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') | 0.75 | Base | Allowed | Secondary Candidate: The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE identified is CWE-862, which is a Class-level CWE. A more specific CWE, CWE-425 (Direct Request), which is a child of CWE-862, was also considered. Due to the nature of the vulnerability being directly related to accessing resources without proper authorization, CWE-425 was also considered.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **missing capability check** (CWE-862), which leads to unauthorized data loss.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial assessment identified CWE-862 as the primary weakness due to the **missing capability check**. The evidence clearly points to a **lack of authorization** in the AJAX actions, allowing unauthorized users to delete attachments. The description explicitly states that a capability check was missing, which aligns perfectly with CWE-862. CWE-425 was considered as a secondary weakness, since the AJAX actions can be seen as direct requests.

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-862: Missing Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
