# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-5855

## Vulnerability Description
The Media Hygiene Remove or Delete Unused Images and More! plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a **missing capability check** on the bulk_action_delete and delete_single_image_call AJAX actions in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary attachments. A nonce check was added in version 3.0.1, however, it wasnt until version 3.0.2 that a capability check was added.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
### Summary:
The provided content describes a vulnerability in the Media Hygiene WordPress plugin, specifically a missing authorization check that allows authenticated users with Subscriber-level access and above to delete arbitrary attachments via AJAX actions.

### Root cause of vulnerability:
The root cause is a missing capability check on the `bulk_action_delete` and `delete_single_image_call` AJAX actions. While a nonce check was implemented in version 3.0.1, it was not sufficient to prevent unauthorized access.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:
- **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to verify if the user initiating the delete action has the required privileges to do so, allowing lower-level users to perform actions intended for administrators.
- **Insecure AJAX Handling:** AJAX actions `bulk_action_delete` and `delete_single_image_call` lacked proper permission checks.

### Impact of exploitation:
- **Arbitrary Attachment Deletion:** An attacker can delete any media attachment on the WordPress site.
- **Data Loss:** This can lead to loss of important content and potentially disrupt the site's functionality.

### Attack vectors:
- **Network:** The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP requests to the server.
- **AJAX actions:** The vulnerable functionality is accessed through AJAX actions `bulk_action_delete` and `delete_single_image_call`.

### Required attacker capabilities/position:
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level privileges.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the target site.

### Additional details from the provided content:

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of the Media Hygiene plugin up to and including 3.0.1.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.0.2 with the addition of a capability check.
*   The Wordfence article indicates that a nonce check was added in 3.0.1, but was insufficient to prevent the attack.
*   The Trac changeset shows the code changes in various files to add the `current_user_can('manage_options')` check in several places. Specifically:

    *    `includes/wmh-scan.php`
    *   `includes/wmh-plugin-feedback.php`

*   The Trac changeset also shows the update of the plugin version in `media-hygiene.php` and `readme.txt` from 3.0.1 to 3.0.2.
*   The Trac changeset also includes changes to the menu position input.
