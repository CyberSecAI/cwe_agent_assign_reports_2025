  "description": "A vulnerability was found in feng_ha_ha/megagao ssm-erp and production_ssm up to 0.0.1. It has been classified as critical. This affects the function uploadFile of the file src/main/java/com/megagao/production/ssm/service/impl/FileServiceImpl.java. The manipulation of the argument uploadFile leads to **unrestricted upload**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This product is distributed under two entirely different names.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-4333 Content (from github.com_34b5649c_20250624_184310.html)\n\nThis content details a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the `production_ssm` project, specifically in the file upload functionality.  It appears to be a security advisory or vulnerability report.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe file upload function in `FileServiceImpl.java` does not filter or process the file name. It directly concatenates the filename and save path, allowing the upload of script files (specifically JSP packages).\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows uploading of arbitrary files without proper validation.\n*   **Lack of Input Validation:**  The application fails to validate the file extension or content type, leading to the execution of malicious code.\n*   **Path Traversal (Potential):** While not explicitly stated, the lack of filename sanitization could potentially lead to path traversal vulnerabilities.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution (RCE) on the server.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n1.  Install and configure the `production_ssm` application.\n2.  Upload a malicious JSP package via the `/file/upload` route.\n3.  Access the path of the uploaded malicious plugin to trigger code execution.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to access the `/file/upload` endpoint of the application.\n*   The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request with a malicious JSP file.\n*   The attacker needs to know the path where the uploaded file is stored to execute the malicious code.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Implement a whitelist for allowed file suffixes.  Only allow uploads of specific, safe file types.\n*   Implement robust input validation to sanitize filenames and prevent path traversal.\n*   Consider using a dedicated file storage service with built-in security features.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including code analysis and reproduction steps.\n*   The affected product repositories are identified as:\n    *   <https://github.com/megagao/production_ssm>\n    *   <https://gitee.com/feng_ha_ha/ssm-erp>\n*   The vulnerability was authored by \"fatd0g\" and reported by \"Hao-Ni\".",
