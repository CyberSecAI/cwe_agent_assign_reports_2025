CWE-770 is a base-level CWE, representing a more specific case of the class-level CWE-400. The vulnerability description strongly suggests that the **improper handling of a large filename** leads to uncontrolled allocation of resources, making CWE-770 a more accurate fit. CWE-1284 is potentially related as the large filename is not validated, however, the lack of validation leads to resource exhaustion, thus CWE-770 is a better fit as the root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n\n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    cwe770 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe1284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n    class cwe1284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of form-data with a large filename**, which leads to **uncontrolled allocation of resources** (CWE-770), and ultimately results in a **Denial of Service (DoS)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling). This choice is based on the vulnerability description indicating that the **improper handling of a large filename** leads to the allocation of resources without limits, causing a denial-of-service condition. The evidence is strong, with the description explicitly mentioning the **improper handling** as the root cause. The retriever results also listed CWE-770 as the top candidate.\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) was considered but deemed less specific. While the vulnerability does result in uncontrolled resource consumption, CWE-770 more accurately captures the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **unlimited allocation of resources**.\n\nCWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) was also considered, as the filename size is a quantity not properly validated. However, the consequence of this **lack of validation** is resource exhaustion, thus CWE-770 better represents the root cause.\n\nThe selection of CWE-770 aligns with the MITRE mapping guidance, as it is a base-level CWE and the usage is ALLOWED.\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n##
