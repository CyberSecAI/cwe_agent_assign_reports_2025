# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-0838

## Vulnerability Description
There exists a heap buffer overflow vulnerable in Abseil-cpp. The sized constructors, reserve(), and rehash() methods of absl{flat,node}hash{set,map} did not impose an upper bound on their size argument. As a result, it was possible for a caller to pass a very large size that would cause an **integer overflow** when computing the size of the containers backing store, and a subsequent out-of-bounds memory write. Subsequent accesses to the container might also access out-of-bounds memory. We recommend upgrading past commit 5a0e2cb5e3958dd90bb8569a2766622cb74d90c1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-0838 based on provided content:

The provided content relates to CVE-2025-0838. Here's a breakdown of the information extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `sized constructors, reserve(), and rehash() methods of absl::{flat,node}hash{set,map}` did not impose an upper bound on their size argument. This allowed a caller to pass a very large size, leading to an integer overflow when calculating the backing store size.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Heap buffer overflow
*   Integer overflow

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Out-of-bounds memory write
*   Potential for subsequent out-of-bounds memory access.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Passing a very large size argument to the `sized constructors, reserve(), and rehash()` methods.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The vulnerability is likely difficult to exploit because container sizes are rarely attacker-controlled.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The fix involves:
    1.  Updating `max_size()` to return the maximum number of items that can be stored in the container.
    2.  Validating the size arguments to the constructors, `reserve()`, and `rehash()` methods, and aborting the program when the argument is invalid.
*   Debian 11 bullseye has been patched with version `0~20200923.3-2+deb11u1`.
*   Upgrading `abseil` packages is recommended.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The bug was discovered by Dmitry Vyukov <dvyukov@google.com>.
*   The vulnerability is present in `absl::{flat,node}hash{set,map}`.
*   The Debian advisory is DLA-4116-1.
*   The Debian bug number is 1098903.
*   The vulnerability is considered difficult to exploit in practice.
*   The fix includes a `HashTableSizeOverflow()` function that is called when an invalid size is detected.
*   Test cases have been added to verify the fix.
