The description clearly indicates a stack-based buffer overflow due to manipulation of the filename argument. Therefore, choosing the more specific variant CWE-121 is appropriate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper handling of the filename argument**, leading to a **stack-based buffer overflow**. This allows an attacker with local access to potentially execute arbitrary code.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description, which explicitly states that the vulnerability is a **stack-based buffer overflow** due to manipulation of the filename argument. The retriever results also list CWE-121 as a relevant CWE. Given this direct evidence, CWE-121 is selected as the primary CWE with high confidence. CWE-119 is included as a secondary CWE because it is a more general description of buffer overflow issues. The selection of CWE-121 is at the optimal level of specificity because the vulnerability is explicitly a stack-based buffer overflow.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25
