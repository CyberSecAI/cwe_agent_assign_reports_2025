# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-4467

## Vulnerability Description
A flaw was found in the QEMU disk image utility (qemu-img) info command. A **specially crafted image file** containing a `json{}` value describing block devices in QMP could cause the qemu-img process on the host to consume large amounts of memory or CPU time, leading to denial of service or read/write to an existing external file.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **specially crafted image file**
- **impact:** consume large amounts of CPU time and consume large amounts of memory and denial of service
- **product:** QEMU disk image utility
- **component:** info command

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information from the provided documents, focusing on CVE-2024-4467:

**1. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the QEMU disk image utility (`qemu-img`)'s `info` command. Specifically, a malicious QCOW2 image with a crafted "json:{}" value describing block devices in QMP can trigger the vulnerability.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Input Validation:** The `qemu-img info` command does not properly validate the crafted `json:{}` values within QCOW2 images, which allows for potentially dangerous processing.
*   **Resource Consumption:**  A specially crafted image file can cause the `qemu-img` process to consume large amounts of memory and CPU time.
*   **Unintended File Access:** In certain configurations, the crafted image can lead to reads/writes on the host system to an existing external file, without the intended permissions or access control mechanisms.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The large memory and CPU consumption can lead to denial of service on the host where `qemu-img` is run.
*   **Host File Read/Write:** Exploitation could enable unauthorized access to sensitive data through reads or unauthorized modification through writes to an existing file on the host system.
    *   This aspect seems to be the most critical, allowing an attacker to break out of a virtualized environment and access the host.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the use of a specially crafted QCOW2 image file containing malicious `json:{}` values within its metadata.
*   The `qemu-img info` command is the entry point for triggering the vulnerability when processing a malicious image file.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to supply a crafted image:** The attacker needs to be able to get the malicious image file to be processed by `qemu-img`, usually through manipulating the system using the vulnerable command.
*   **Execution of `qemu-img info`:** The attacker would also need to be able to somehow trigger the vulnerable `qemu-img info` command on the target system with the crafted image, or use it for an operation it was designed to, but with the malicious file, such as a check on the file for an import.
*   **User with privileges to execute qemu-img:** Generally, a user on the host with the ability to run `qemu-img` and access a location where the malicious image can be read.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Upstream Patch:** An upstream patch is available that addresses this issue.
*   **Affected Products:** Many Red Hat products using QEMU as well as NetApp StorageGrid. The Red Hat bugzilla entry shows several products are affected: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (various versions), Red Hat Advanced Virtualization for RHEL 8.4.0, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 and many other versions.
*   **Severity:** Red Hat and NetApp both classify this as an "Important" vulnerability.
*   **NetApp mitigation**: Per NetApp, no current products are affected.
*   **Red Hat fix** The Red Hat advisory states, that more recent versions of the identified packages might be available and to click on the packages to obtain more details.
*   **CVE-2024-4467** is a vulnerability with a CVSS score of 7.8 (HIGH) that allows host file read/write.

**Summary of Relevant Points from Different Documents:**

*   **Red Hat Bugzilla:** Provides detailed tracking of the vulnerability, including the reporter, patch information, and affected products. It also links to the upstream patch.
*   **Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSAs):** Detail the specific Red Hat products and versions affected, as well as the fixed package versions and links back to the bugzilla entry and CVE.
*   **NetApp Security Advisory:** While noting the CVE, it states that no NetApp products are currently affected.
*   **Openwall Security Mailing List:** Describes the QEMU vulnerability in context of an OpenStack Nova vulnerability, and cautions that `qemu-img` must be patched for CVE-2024-4467 when addressing the OpenStack issue.

This CVE allows an attacker to craft a special image to be processed by `qemu-img info` to execute code in the host, potentially giving them unauthorized access. The advisory highlights that the vulnerability can be triggered by a specially crafted `json:{}` value, which could lead to DoS or arbitrary file I/O. It is imperative to apply the fixes provided by the vendors to mitigate this serious vulnerability.
