CWE-522 is a Class level CWE and a parent of CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password). CWE-312 is a more direct match to the vulnerability description because it explicitly mentions sensitive information stored in cleartext. While credentials fall under the scope of CWE-522, the description doesn't explicitly state that the stored information are credentials, but the vulnerability description does mention \"credentials in plain text\". Since CWE-312 is more specific and the vulnerability description mentions \"plain text\", it's a better fit than the more general CWE-522.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe522 secondary\n    class cwe256 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-312)**. This **weakness** could potentially lead to exposure of the sensitive information to unauthorized actors.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified CWE-312 as the primary weakness due to the explicit mention of \"plain text\" storage of credentials. The vulnerability description directly states that the MET ONE 3400+ instrument \"temporarily store credentials in plain text within the system.\" This aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-312, which describes the storage of sensitive information in cleartext.\n\nCWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) was also considered, given that credentials are involved. However, since the core issue is the lack of encryption (i.e., storing in plain text), CWE-312 is a more precise representation of the root cause. CWE-522 is a class level CWE, while CWE-312 is a base level CWE.\n\n*Vulnerability Description Key Phrases*:\n- **product:** MET ONE 3400+\n- **version:** software v1.0.41\n\nI am overriding the retriever results that had CWE-522 ranked higher than CWE-312 and instead ranking CWE-312 as the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 354.40\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.",
