The vulnerability results in the exposure of sensitive information. |\n| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.7 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary CWE. The exposure of sensitive information occurs because of a **missing authorization** check in the WordPress core search feature. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-200, which represents the exposure of sensitive information. CWE-862 is considered as a secondary CWE because the exposure is due to a **missing authorization** check. CWE-200 is a Class-level CWE, and while more specific CWEs might exist, the description aligns well with the general nature of information exposure. CWE-862 is also a Class-level CWE, suggesting that further refinement to a Base-level CWE might be possible.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe200 -->|CANBECAUSE| cwe862\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing authorization** check (CWE-862), which allows unauthenticated attackers to access restricted posts via the WordPress core search feature, ultimately leading to **Sensitive Information Exposure** (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause and the resulting impact. The vulnerability description clearly states that the plugin is vulnerable to **Sensitive Information Exposure**. This aligns with CWE-200. The exposure is happening due to the WordPress core search feature, which makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data from posts that should have been restricted. The Retriever results also indicated CWE-200 as a potential candidate. The **missing authorization** check is a contributing factor. Therefore, CWE-862 is considered as a secondary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this
