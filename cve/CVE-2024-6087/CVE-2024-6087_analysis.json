  "description": "An **improper access control** vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary at the latest commit (a761d83) on the main branch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to use the auth tokens issued by the invite user functionality to obtain valid JWT tokens. These tokens can be used to compromise target users upon registration for their own arbitrary organizations. The attacker can invite a target email, obtain a one-time use token, retract the invite, and later use the token to reset the password of the target user, leading to full account takeover.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability fixed by commit `844e8855c7a713dc7371766dba4125de4007b1cf`:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability lies in the password reset functionality. The original code had logic that allowed a user to request a password reset even if a valid, unexpired reset token already existed for the user. This could lead to unintended behavior and potentially security issues.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Logic Flaw in Password Reset Request Handling:** The code incorrectly handled the case where a user already had an active password reset token. Instead of preventing a new request when a valid token existed, it would trigger another reset request.\n- **Incorrect JWT Type:** The original code was not setting the correct type in the token.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Unnecessary Password Reset Emails:** An attacker, by knowing a target user's email, could potentially trigger multiple password reset emails. This could lead to confusion or annoyance for the target user, and potentially be a vector for other attacks.\n- **Confusion and potential DoS:** Although unlikely in this case, an attacker could potentially exploit this logic by requesting multiple password resets, and potentially cause denial of service (DoS).\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Email Address:** An attacker would need to know the email address of the target user.\n- **Requesting Multiple Resets:** The attacker could repeatedly request password resets for a target email.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the `/request-password-reset` endpoint. This typically means the attacker should be able to interact with the application through its web interface or API.\n- Knowledge of a valid email address is required to trigger the vulnerability.\n\n**Additional Details:**\nThe fix implemented in the commit `844e8855c7a713dc7371766dba4125de4007b1cf` addresses the vulnerability by:\n- **Correcting the Logic:** The logic for handling password reset requests was updated to prevent a new request when a valid, unexpired token already exists.\n- **Setting JWT type:** Added `type: \"password_reset\"` to password reset token.\n\nThe code changes include:\n-   Removal of an if statement that incorrectly allowed reset password request if a recovery token existed and is not expired\n-   Setting the JWT type to `password_reset` when generating a password reset token.\n\nThis commit ensures that a new password reset request is only generated when an existing token is expired or does not exist, preventing unnecessary reset emails and other potential issues.",

This leads to an authorization bypass where an attacker can use these tokens to obtain valid JWT tokens, ultimately compromising user accounts through password resets.\n\n1.  **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The **root cause** is the **improper access control** related to the invite tokens.\n2.  **Authorization Bypass (CWE-639):** Attackers exploit the tokens to bypass authorization and generate valid JWTs.\n3.  **Account Takeover:** Compromised JWTs enable attackers to reset passwords and take over accounts.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment identifies **improper access control** as the primary weakness. The retriever results and relationship analysis point to more specific CWEs that could be relevant. Given the information available, CWE-284, CWE-639, and CWE-306 collectively provide a more complete picture of the vulnerability. CWE-284 is a general class, while CWE-639 and CWE-306 provide specific details of the weakness. The decision to include CWE-639 and CWE-306 as secondary mappings is based on the potential for authorization bypass and potential lack of authentication in certain scenarios.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
