CWE-125 **(Out-of-bounds Read)** is a base-level CWE and a more specific instance of the class-level CWE-119 **(Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer)**. The vulnerability description clearly indicates reading beyond the buffer, making CWE-125 a more accurate fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    cwe497[\"CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\"]\n\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe125 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe497\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe497 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **access of memory location after the end of the buffer** (root cause), leading to an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) which then results in information disclosure (CWE-497).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, particularly the \"**Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer**\" vulnerability description key phrase and the CVE reference links content summary that explicitly states, \"The vulnerability is due to an access of memory location after the end of a buffer.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-125 **(Out-of-bounds Read)** is based on the fact that the vulnerability involves reading memory beyond the intended buffer. The description aligns perfectly with the definition of CWE-125. The retriever results also listed CWE-125 as a potential candidate.\n\nCWE-497 **(Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere)** is selected as a secondary CWE because the out-of-bounds read leads to information disclosure, which falls under the scope of CWE-497.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately reflect the nature of the vulnerability based on the provided information. CWE-125 is a base-level CWE, providing a detailed description of the out-of-bounds read, while CWE-497 describes the resulting information exposure.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary.
