## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the access control list (ACL) programming of Cisco IOS Software that is running on Cisco Catalyst 1000 Switches and Cisco Catalyst 2960L Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured ACL. This vulnerability is due to the use of both an IPv4 ACL and a dynamic ACL of IP Source Guard on the same interface, which is an **unsupported configuration**. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass an ACL on the affected device. Note Cisco documentation has been updated to reflect that this is an **unsupported configuration**. However, Cisco is publishing this advisory because the device will not prevent an administrator from configuring both features on the same interface. There are no plans to implement the ability to configure both features on the same interface on Cisco Catalyst 1000 or Catalyst 2960L Switches.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-20137 based on provided content:

**Overall:** The provided content details a vulnerability in Cisco IOS Software affecting Catalyst 1000 and 2960L switches, allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass a configured ACL. The root cause is the unsupported configuration of both an IPv4 ACL and IP Source Guard on the same interface.

**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from using both an IPv4 ACL and a dynamic ACL of IP Source Guard on the same interface, which is an unsupported configuration by Cisco.

**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   ACL bypass: An attacker can bypass a configured ACL.
*   Unsupported Configuration: The vulnerability exists because Cisco allows an unsupported configuration to be implemented.

**3. Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can bypass ACL protections on the affected device.
*   The overall impact depends on the importance of the assets the ACL was intended to protect.

**4. Attack vectors:**

*   Remote: The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote.
*   Traffic Sending: The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending traffic through the affected device.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Unauthenticated
*   Remote access to the network
*   Ability to send network traffic to the affected device.

**6. Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Workaround:** Configure either the IPv4 ACL *or* IP Source Guard, but not both, on the interface.
*   **No Software Fix:** Cisco does not plan to release software updates to address this vulnerability, as it's due to an unsupported configuration.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability was discovered during a Cisco TAC support case.
*   Cisco has updated its documentation to mark the configuration as unsupported.
*   IP DHCP snooping must be enabled for IP Source Guard to function.
*   CVSS v3.1 score: 4.7 (Medium severity) with vector CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N
*   Affected products are listed with specific vulnerable software versions.
*   Products *not* vulnerable are also listed (IOS XE, IOS XR, Meraki, NX-OS).
*   Detailed instructions are provided on how to determine if a device is vulnerable using the `show running-config` CLI command.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
