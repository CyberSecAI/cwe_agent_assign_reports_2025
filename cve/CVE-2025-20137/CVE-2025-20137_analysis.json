  "description": "A vulnerability in the access control list (ACL) programming of Cisco IOS Software that is running on Cisco Catalyst 1000 Switches and Cisco Catalyst 2960L Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured ACL. This vulnerability is due to the use of both an IPv4 ACL and a dynamic ACL of IP Source Guard on the same interface, which is an **unsupported configuration**. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass an ACL on the affected device. Note Cisco documentation has been updated to reflect that this is an **unsupported configuration**. However, Cisco is publishing this advisory because the device will not prevent an administrator from configuring both features on the same interface. There are no plans to implement the ability to configure both features on the same interface on Cisco Catalyst 1000 or Catalyst 2960L Switches.",

  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-20137 based on provided content:\n\n**Overall:** The provided content details a vulnerability in Cisco IOS Software affecting Catalyst 1000 and 2960L switches, allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass a configured ACL. The root cause is the unsupported configuration of both an IPv4 ACL and IP Source Guard on the same interface.\n\n**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from using both an IPv4 ACL and a dynamic ACL of IP Source Guard on the same interface, which is an unsupported configuration by Cisco.\n\n**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   ACL bypass: An attacker can bypass a configured ACL.\n*   Unsupported Configuration: The vulnerability exists because Cisco allows an unsupported configuration to be implemented.\n\n**3. Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   An attacker can bypass ACL protections on the affected device.\n*   The overall impact depends on the importance of the assets the ACL was intended to protect.\n\n**4. Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Remote: The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote.\n*   Traffic Sending: The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending traffic through the affected device.\n\n**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Unauthenticated\n*   Remote access to the network\n*   Ability to send network traffic to the affected device.\n\n**6. Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Workaround:** Configure either the IPv4 ACL *or* IP Source Guard, but not both, on the interface.\n*   **No Software Fix:** Cisco does not plan to release software updates to address this vulnerability, as it's due to an unsupported configuration.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The vulnerability was discovered during a Cisco TAC support case.\n*   Cisco has updated its documentation to mark the configuration as unsupported.\n*   IP DHCP snooping must be enabled for IP Source Guard to function.\n*   CVSS v3.1 score: 4.7 (Medium severity) with vector CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N\n*   Affected products are listed with specific vulnerable software versions.\n*   Products *not* vulnerable are also listed (IOS XE, IOS XR, Meraki, NX-OS).\n*   Detailed instructions are provided on how to determine if a device is vulnerable using the `show running-config` CLI command.",

In this case, **incorrect authorization** is more specific and therefore more appropriate. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship considered was that CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). While CWE-284 could broadly apply, the more specific CWE-863 was chosen as the ACL bypass directly leads to **incorrect authorization**, aligning well with its definition.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **unsupported configuration** of an IPv4 ACL and IP Source Guard on the same interface. This leads to the device failing to properly enforce the ACL, resulting in an attacker bypassing the ACL and gaining **unauthorized access**.\n\nUnsupported Configuration -> ACL Bypass -> **Incorrect Authorization**\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) due to the ACL bypass. However, upon closer examination and consideration of the guidance on Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control, CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was deemed more appropriate. The root cause is the **unsupported configuration**, leading to the device's failure to correctly authorize traffic based on the configured ACL.\n\nThe evidence supporting this includes:\n*   Vulnerability Description Key Phrases: \"**rootcause:** **unsupported configuration**, **impact:** bypass a configured ACL\"\n*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"ACL bypass: An attacker can bypass a configured ACL.\"\n*   CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"The vulnerability stems from using both an IPv4 ACL and a dynamic ACL of IP Source Guard on the same interface, which is an **unsupported configuration** by Cisco.\"\n\nThe choice of CWE-863 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly reflects the authorization failure caused by the **unsupported configuration**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
