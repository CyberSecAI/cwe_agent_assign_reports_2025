# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-45776

# Vulnerability Description

    When reading the language .mo file in grub_mofile_open(), grub2 fails to verify an **integer overflow** when allocating its internal buffer. A crafted .mo file may lead the buffer size calculation to overflow, leading to **out-of-bound reads** and writes. This flaw allows an attacker to leak sensitive data or overwrite critical data, possibly circumventing secure boot protections.

    ## WEAKNESS: 'out-of-bound reads'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read (Score: 384.49)

The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....

### 2. CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size (Score: 373.68)

The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow....

### 3. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 370.11)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...
