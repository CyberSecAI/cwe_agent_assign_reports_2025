  "description": "The Quiz And Survey Master - Best Quiz, Exam and Survey Plugin for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the question_id parameter in all versions up to, and including, 9.0.1 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-3592:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and lack of proper SQL query preparation in the 'question_id' parameter within the Quiz And Survey Master plugin for WordPress.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a database query, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability enables attackers to extract sensitive data from the WordPress database.\n- **Potential for Further Attacks:** SQL injection can be a stepping stone for other attacks, potentially leading to complete compromise of the website if the attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The vulnerability is located in the `options-page-questions-tab.php` file, specifically within the function `qsm_bulk_delete_question_from_database`.\n- The attack vector is via the `question_id` parameter, which is passed as part of a POST request when deleting questions.\n- The vulnerable code constructs a SQL DELETE query using unsanitized `question_id`.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user.\n- **Privilege Level:**  The attacker must have at least 'contributor' level privileges or higher to exploit the vulnerability\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Quiz And Survey Master plugin up to and including 9.0.1.\n- The vulnerability was patched in version 9.0.2 by adding sanitization, proper validation, and usage of placeholders in the SQL query.\n-  The provided code diff highlights changes in how the `question_id` is handled, including validation, sanitization, and use of placeholders within the SQL query.\n- The fix sanitizes input, filters the IDs, and uses `wpdb->prepare` to prevent SQL injection.",

The **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query** leads directly to SQL Injection. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship is that CWE-89 is a base level CWE that directly reflects the vulnerability. Other CWEs like CWE-943 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic) are classes that contain CWE-89, but CWE-89 itself is more specific and therefore a better fit. There are no complex chains to consider here.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe943[\"CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe943\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe943 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**.\n2.  **Weakness:** SQL Injection (CWE-89)\n3.  **Impact:** Sensitive information disclosure (extract sensitive information from the database).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the clear evidence provided in the vulnerability description and CVE summary. The **root cause** is directly related to the **insufficient escaping** and **lack of query preparation**, leading to the **SQL Injection vulnerability**. The provided evidence explicitly mentions the attack vector (question_id parameter), affected versions, and the sanitization implemented in the patch. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-89 is the most specific and appropriate CWE.\n\nThe vulnerability description clearly states the **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This directly leads to the possibility of injecting SQL commands, which aligns precisely with CWE-89.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-943: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic - This is a class-level CWE, and while relevant, CWE-89 provides a more specific description of the SQL Injection vulnerability.\n*   CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output - This is a more general class of weakness, and SQL Injection is a more specific case.\n*   CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - This is not relevant as the vulnerability is SQL Injection and not related to CSRF.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
