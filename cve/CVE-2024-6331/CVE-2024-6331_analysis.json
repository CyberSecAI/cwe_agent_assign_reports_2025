  "description": "stitionai/devika main branch as of commit cdfb782b0e634b773b10963c8034dc9207ba1f9f is vulnerable to Local File Read (LFI) by **Prompt Injection**. The integration of Google Gimini 1.0 Pro with `HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_NONE` for `HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH` and `HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT` in `safety_settings` disables content protection. This allows malicious commands to be executed, such as reading sensitive file contents like `/etc/passwd`.",

The impact, Local File Read, aligns with CWE-22. While CWE-22 could be seen as a consequence of CWE-1427, it is relevant because it highlights the specific type of file access achieved through the injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1427[\"CWE-1427: Improper Neutralization of Input Used for LLM Prompting\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    \n    cwe22 -- INDIRECTLY CAUSED BY --> cwe1427\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe1427 primary\n    class cwe22 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization of input for LLM prompting** (CWE-1427). This leads to the ability to inject malicious commands, which then results in a local file read (CWE-22).\n  - CWE-1427: **Root cause** - **Prompt Injection**\n  - CWE-22: Impact - Local file read via path traversal.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary classification is CWE-1427, as the root cause is clearly identified as **prompt injection**. The vulnerability description key phrases explicitly state this. The evidence is strong. The additional classification of CWE-22 is due to the impact of a local file read. The high retriever score and the direct connection to the vulnerability specifics support this selection.
