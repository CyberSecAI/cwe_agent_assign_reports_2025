## Vulnerability Description
IrfanView DXF File Parsing **Memory Corruption** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a memory corruption condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24699.

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing DXF files, leading to a memory corruption condition.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Insufficient input validation during DXF file parsing, resulting in memory corruption.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could lead to complete system compromise.
*  **Attack Vectors:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by enticing the target user to either visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious DXF file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be able to deliver a malicious DXF file or a link to a malicious webpage hosting the file to the target user. User interaction is required for successful exploitation. The attacker doesn't need any special privileges to execute the attack.

The information provided by the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) offers more specific details than the generic CVE description, particularly concerning the attack vector (malicious DXF file) and the specific vulnerability (memory corruption due to lack of input validation).
