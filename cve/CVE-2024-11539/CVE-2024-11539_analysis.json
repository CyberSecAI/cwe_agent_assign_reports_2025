  "description": "IrfanView DXF File Parsing **Memory Corruption** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of IrfanView. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can result in a memory corruption condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-24699.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing DXF files, leading to a memory corruption condition.\n*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Insufficient input validation during DXF file parsing, resulting in memory corruption.\n*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could lead to complete system compromise.\n*  **Attack Vectors:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by enticing the target user to either visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious DXF file.\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be able to deliver a malicious DXF file or a link to a malicious webpage hosting the file to the target user. User interaction is required for successful exploitation. The attacker doesn't need any special privileges to execute the attack.\n\nThe information provided by the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) offers more specific details than the generic CVE description, particularly concerning the attack vector (malicious DXF file) and the specific vulnerability (memory corruption due to lack of input validation).",

CWE-787 is a child of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), indicating a more general class of memory buffer errors. The root cause, **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, points towards CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), which can precede memory corruption issues like CWE-787. While CWE-20 is a parent (class) of CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input), the description lacks specific details to justify the selection of the more specific CWE-1284.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** (CWE-20). This leads to a **memory corruption** condition where data is written out of bounds (CWE-787). The ultimate impact is the ability to execute arbitrary code, which is a consequence of the memory corruption.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) -> CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) -> Remote Code Execution (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe analysis identifies CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) as the primary CWE due to the **memory corruption** resulting from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**. This aligns with the vulnerability description and the primary CWE match from similar CVE descriptions. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a secondary CWE because the root cause is described as the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**.\n\nThe relationship graph highlights the connection between the root cause (CWE-20) and the resulting memory corruption (CWE-787). The selection of CWE-787 is at the optimal level of specificity as it directly represents the out-of-bounds write condition.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 995.10\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input or data, but it does\n        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the\n        properties that are required to process the data safely and\n        correctly.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287]. It is not useful for trend analysis. It is also a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).\n\n### Other CWEs Considered and Rejected:\n\n*   CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read): While related to memory safety, the vulnerability description specifically mentions **memory corruption**, implying a write operation, not a read.\n*   CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer): This is a higher-level class, and CWE-787 provides a more specific description of the weakness.\n*   CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow) / CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow): The description does not specify whether the buffer is heap-based or stack-based.\n*   CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input): While input validation is the root cause, the description doesn't explicitly state the improper validation is related to a quantity (size or length).\n*   CWE-788 (Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer): Similar to CWE-125, the provided description focuses on **memory corruption** which is a write, as opposed to a read.\n*   CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size): The root cause is not the calculation of the size, but the **lack of proper validation**.",
