### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **unlimited number of email verification requests**
- **product:** Trend Micro ID Security
- **impact:** abuse, denial of service
- **attacker:** attacker
- **version:** 3.0 and below

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the lack of rate limiting on email verification requests within the Trend Micro ID Security application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Rate Limiting:** The application does not restrict the number of email verification requests a user can send. This lack of restriction is the core vulnerability.
- **Potential for Abuse:** The absence of rate limiting opens the door for attackers to exploit the email verification functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can flood the system with numerous email verification requests. This could lead to the abuse of system resources and potentially make the service unavailable for legitimate users.
- **Potential for Abuse:** The uncontrolled ability to send verification requests could potentially be abused in other ways not specified in this advisory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a large number of email verification requests.
- The attack can be performed remotely, by making requests to the service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to make requests to the email verification service of the Trend Micro ID Security app.
- No special access or privileges are mentioned as being required.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Products:** Trend Micro ID Security version 3.0 and below on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Solution:** Trend Micro has implemented a backend system improvement to resolve this issue, without requiring a new version of the app.
- **Acknowledgement:** Trend Micro credits Nisha Thakur for reporting the vulnerability.
- **No Known Attacks:**  Trend Micro states they have not received any reports nor are they aware of any actual attacks against the affected products related to this vulnerability.
