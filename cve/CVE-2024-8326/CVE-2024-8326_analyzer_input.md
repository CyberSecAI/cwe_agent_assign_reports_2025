# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-8326

## Vulnerability Description
The s2Member Excellent for All Kinds of Memberships, Content Restriction Paywalls & Member Access Subscriptions plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Sensitive Information Exposure** in all versions up to, and including, 241114 via the sc_get_details function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract sensitive data including user data and database configuration information, which can lead to reading, updating, or dropping database tables. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 241114.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **Sensitive Information Exposure**
- **impact:** extract sensitive data including user data and database configuration information
- **attacker:** authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access and above
- **product:** s2Member Excellent for All Kinds of Memberships
- **version:** all versions up to and including 241114
- **component:** sc_get_details function

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `sc_get_details` function in the s2Member plugin, which allows retrieval of sensitive information via the `[s2Get /]` shortcode.  The initial implementation of the shortcode did not properly validate the `constant`, `user_field`, and `user_option` attributes, allowing for the extraction of various user data, site configuration details and even arbitrary constants.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Shortcode Handling:** The `sc_get_details` function lacks sufficient validation and sanitization for the attributes passed to the `[s2Get /]` shortcode.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The shortcode allows access to user data, including login information, email, names, custom fields, subscription details, IP addresses, and more.
*   **Configuration Exposure:** The shortcode can expose internal constants, potentially including database configuration parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can obtain sensitive user information.
*   **Account Hijacking:** Exposed login information can lead to account takeovers.
*   **Data Breach:** Sensitive data leaks could harm users and the site owner.
*   **Complete Site Compromise:** Exposed database configuration information could allow the attacker to read, modify or drop database tables, leading to a complete site compromise

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers use the `[s2Get /]` shortcode with crafted attributes on a page or post.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have at least "Contributor" level access on the WordPress site.
*   **Shortcode Usage:** The attacker needs to be able to create or edit content that allows usage of shortcodes.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `sc_get_details` function processes attributes like `constant`, `user_field`, and `user_option` to fetch data.
*   The vulnerability was partially patched in version 241114 by limiting the constants that can be accessed.
*   Version 241216 added extra validation to address the issue further and fully fix the vulnerability.
*   The file `sc-gets-in.inc.php` is the core of the vulnerability. The initial patch in version 241114 (changeset 3188157) limited the constants that can be accessed with the shortcode to only those starting with `S2MEMBER_CURRENT_USER`. The final patch in version 241216 (changeset 3208315) fixed the vulnerability completely by adding an allowlist of valid attribute values.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The Wordfence article provides a clear description of the vulnerability and its impact.
*   The provided Trac links show the evolution of the code and the patches.
*   The vulnerability is rated as High severity (CVSS 8.8).
*   The vulnerability was discovered by wesley (wcraft).
