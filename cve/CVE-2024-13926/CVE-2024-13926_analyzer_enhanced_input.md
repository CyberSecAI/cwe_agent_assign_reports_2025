## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## CVE-2024-13926 Analysis

The provided content is directly related to CVE-2024-13926. It provides significantly more detail than the placeholder CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The plugin does not properly handle input, allowing an attacker to create a post containing a large number of tags, leading to a catastrophic backtracking issue in the regular expression processing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
*   Improper Input Validation

**Impact of exploitation:**

Denial of Service (DoS).  The vulnerability can cause high CPU usage, potentially crashing the server. The PoC shows 100% CPU core usage with concurrent requests.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An authenticated attacker (Author+) can publish a post containing a specially crafted payload with many tags.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have Author+ privileges on the WordPress site.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   As of March 28, 2025, there is no known fix available.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Plugin:** WP-Syntax <= 1.2
*   **CVSS:** 3.1 (Low)
*   **Proof of Concept:** A Gist is provided with a script and payload: [https://gist.github.com/Rudloff/9d8e016a76b57ce7cee25447a4e1e0a8](https://gist.github.com/Rudloff/9d8e016a76b57ce7cee25447a4e1e0a8)
