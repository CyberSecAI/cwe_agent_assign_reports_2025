  "description": "The Image Hover Effects - Elementor Addon plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the eihe_link parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.3 due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-4780\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `eihe_link` parameter within the Image Hover Effects \u2013 Elementor Addon plugin.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input, specifically the `eihe_link` parameter, allowing malicious scripts to be stored in the database and executed when a user accesses the affected page.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- Arbitrary web script execution: Successful exploitation enables an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary web scripts within the context of a user's browser when they view a page containing the vulnerable element. This could lead to:\n    - Session hijacking: Stealing user session cookies.\n    - Defacement: Altering the appearance of the web page.\n    - Redirection: Redirecting users to malicious websites.\n    - Data theft: Gaining access to sensitive user data.\n    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The primary attack vector is through the `eihe_link` parameter, which can be manipulated to include malicious JavaScript code. This parameter is part of the plugin's settings.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- Authenticated attacker with Contributor-level access or higher: Attackers need to have an account on the WordPress site with at least Contributor role privileges.\n- Ability to create/edit content: The attacker must be able to create or edit content on the site where the vulnerable plugin is used.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Image Hover Effects \u2013 Elementor Addon plugin up to and including version 1.4.3.\n- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.4.4.\n- The vulnerable code is located in `includes/widgets.php`.\n- The fix involves properly sanitizing the `eihe_link` parameter using `add_link_attributes` to prevent XSS.\n\nThis vulnerability allows for stored XSS, which means the malicious script persists and can affect other users who visit the injected page.",

CWE-79 is a base CWE, and while there are more specific variants, the provided information does not specify which variant is most applicable. Therefore, the base CWE is the most appropriate. The retriever results also highlight the relevance of CWE-79.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe79 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**\n2.  **Weakness:** CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n3.  **Impact:** Injection of arbitrary web scripts, leading to potential session hijacking, defacement, redirection, or data theft.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which clearly states the **root cause** as **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The \"CWE for similar CVE Descriptions\" section also identifies CWE-79 as the primary match. The retriever results also list CWE-79 as a highly relevant CWE.

As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-96: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Statically Saved Code ('Static Code Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before inserting the input into an executable resource, such as a library, configuration file, or template.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g. \"eval\").\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1311.12\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
