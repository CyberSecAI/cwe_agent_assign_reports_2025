  "description": "PKCE was implemented in the OAuth implementation in workers-oauth-provider that is part of MCP framework https//github.com/cloudflare/workers-mcp . However, it was found that an attacker could cause the check to be skipped. Fixed in https//github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/27 https//github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/27 Impact PKCE is a defense-in-depth mechanism against certain kinds of attacks and was an optional extension in OAuth 2.0 which became required in the OAuth 2.1 draft. (Note that the MCP specification requires OAuth 2.1.). This bug completely bypasses PKCE protection.",

Given the CVE ID is a placeholder, this is the most relevant information available.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability is a PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) downgrade attack, as described in RFC9700. The details of the attack itself are not fully explained in this content, but the reference to RFC9700 provides further information.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\nThe weakness lies in the potential for an attacker to downgrade the PKCE mechanism, potentially allowing them to obtain an authorization code without possessing the corresponding code verifier.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation could allow an attacker to obtain unauthorized access to resources protected by the OAuth 2.0 flow.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nThe attack vector involves manipulating the OAuth 2.0 authorization request to force a downgrade of the PKCE method.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\nThe attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify the OAuth 2.0 authorization request.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe pull request #27 merged into the `main` branch mitigates the PKCE downgrade attack. The specific code changes are not provided in this content, but the merge commit message indicates the issue has been addressed.\n\n**More detail than official CVE description:**\n\nYes, this content provides more detail than a placeholder CVE description. It identifies the specific type of attack (PKCE downgrade), references the relevant RFC for more information, and confirms that a fix has been implemented.",

CWE-304 is a more specific case of a missing step within an authentication process, making it a better fit than the more general CWE-573. CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) is a broader class that encompasses various authentication weaknesses, but CWE-304 pinpoints the exact issue: a missing step.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe304[\"CWE-304: Missing Critical Step in Authentication\"]\n    cwe573[\"CWE-573: Missing a Critical Step in a Process\"]\n    cwe1390[\"CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\"]\n    \n    cwe304 -->|CHILDOF| cwe573\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe304 primary\n    class cwe1390 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing critical step in the authentication** process (CWE-304) within the PKCE implementation. This leads to a bypass of the PKCE protection, ultimately resulting in **weak authentication** (CWE-1390), making the system vulnerable to attacks that PKCE is designed to prevent.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-304 (Missing Critical Step in Authentication) because the vulnerability description states that \"an attacker could cause the check to be skipped.\" This indicates that a step in the authentication process, specifically within the PKCE implementation, was missing or improperly handled. This aligns directly with the description of CWE-304.\n\nCWE-1390 (Weak Authentication) was also considered as a secondary candidate, because the **impact** of the vulnerability is that the authentication becomes weak due to the bypass of PKCE. However, CWE-304 better represents the **root cause** of the problem, which is the **missing step** in the PKCE implementation.\n\nThe decision is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description, particularly the phrase \"an attacker could cause the check to be skipped,\" and the understanding that PKCE is an authentication mechanism. The graph relationships support the selection of CWE-304 as it is a more specific child of CWE-573 (Missing a Critical Step in a Process). The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-304 identifies the precise missing step related to authentication, and it is a Base level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed -
