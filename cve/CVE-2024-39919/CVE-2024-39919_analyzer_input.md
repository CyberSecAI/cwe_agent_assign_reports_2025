# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-39919

## Vulnerability Description
@jmondi/url-to-png is an open source URL to PNG utility featuring parallel rendering using Playwright for screenshots and with storage caching via Local, S3, or CouchDB. The package includes an `ALLOW_LIST` where the host can specify which services the user is permitted to capture screenshots of. By default, capturing screenshots of web services running on localhost, 127.0.0.1, or the [] is allowed. If someone hosts this project on a server, users could then capture screenshots of other web services running locally. This issue has been addressed in version 2.1.1 with the addition of a blocklist. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** capture screenshots of other web services running locally
- **attacker:** users
- **product:** url-to-png
- **version:** before 2.1.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-39919:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a design oversight in the `url-to-png` package. The package allows users to capture screenshots of specified URLs. While it has an `ALLOW_LIST` to restrict the domains from which screenshots can be taken, it lacks a `BLOCK_LIST` by default, leading to a potential security issue. This means if the service is hosted on a server, a user could potentially capture screenshots of other web services running locally on that server (e.g., services on localhost, 127.0.0.1, or [::]).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Default Block List:** The primary weakness is the absence of a default block list. While an allow list exists, this approach does not prevent internal services from being accessed.
*   **Potential for Internal Service Exposure:** The package, when deployed on a server, could be exploited to capture screenshots of other web services running locally, which are not meant to be publicly accessible.
*   **Misinterpretation of Intended Usage:** The package was intended for capturing screenshots of web pages, but it was not designed to explicitly prevent the capturing of local services.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to internal web services by capturing screenshots, which could expose sensitive information intended to remain private.
*   **Exposure of internal services:** Users may be able to use the service to capture screenshots of other services running on the same host.
*   **Limited Scope:** This is rated as low severity, as it may not allow for full compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the server where the `url-to-png` service is running.
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** An attacker can manipulate the `url` parameter in the request to point to an internal service running on the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access to the Server:** The attacker must have the ability to make requests to the server running the `url-to-png` service.
*   **Understanding of Local Network Configuration:** The attacker must be aware of local service IPs and ports on the target server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is described as a "design oversight" rather than a traditional vulnerability.
*   The provided PoC demonstrates how to capture a screenshot of a local service running on `http://localhost:3001`.
*   The fix for this would be to implement a block list that by default would block localhost/127.0.0.1/[::].

The commit diff provided shows the implementation of the block list functionality.
Specifically, it shows the addition of:
- a new middleware called `block_list.ts`
- The `app.ts` file now uses this middleware.
- The `utils.ts` file has been renamed to `formatUrlList` from `formatAllowList`
- The allow list middleware and the block list middleware now correctly use `new URL().host` to check the domain of the url.
- The .env.sample now includes a commented-out `BLOCK_LIST` option.
