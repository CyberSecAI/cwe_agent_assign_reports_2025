  "description": "@jmondi/url-to-png is an open source URL to PNG utility featuring parallel rendering using Playwright for screenshots and with storage caching via Local, S3, or CouchDB. The package includes an `ALLOW_LIST` where the host can specify which services the user is permitted to capture screenshots of. By default, capturing screenshots of web services running on localhost, 127.0.0.1, or the [] is allowed. If someone hosts this project on a server, users could then capture screenshots of other web services running locally. This issue has been addressed in version 2.1.1 with the addition of a blocklist. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-39919:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from a design oversight in the `url-to-png` package. The package allows users to capture screenshots of specified URLs. While it has an `ALLOW_LIST` to restrict the domains from which screenshots can be taken, it lacks a `BLOCK_LIST` by default, leading to a potential security issue. This means if the service is hosted on a server, a user could potentially capture screenshots of other web services running locally on that server (e.g., services on localhost, 127.0.0.1, or [::]).\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Lack of Default Block List:** The primary weakness is the absence of a default block list. While an allow list exists, this approach does not prevent internal services from being accessed.\n*   **Potential for Internal Service Exposure:** The package, when deployed on a server, could be exploited to capture screenshots of other web services running locally, which are not meant to be publicly accessible.\n*   **Misinterpretation of Intended Usage:** The package was intended for capturing screenshots of web pages, but it was not designed to explicitly prevent the capturing of local services.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to internal web services by capturing screenshots, which could expose sensitive information intended to remain private.\n*   **Exposure of internal services:** Users may be able to use the service to capture screenshots of other services running on the same host.\n*   **Limited Scope:** This is rated as low severity, as it may not allow for full compromise of the system.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the server where the `url-to-png` service is running.\n*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** An attacker can manipulate the `url` parameter in the request to point to an internal service running on the server.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Access to the Server:** The attacker must have the ability to make requests to the server running the `url-to-png` service.\n*   **Understanding of Local Network Configuration:** The attacker must be aware of local service IPs and ports on the target server.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is described as a \"design oversight\" rather than a traditional vulnerability.\n*   The provided PoC demonstrates how to capture a screenshot of a local service running on `http://localhost:3001`.\n*   The fix for this would be to implement a block list that by default would block localhost/127.0.0.1/[::].\n\nThe commit diff provided shows the implementation of the block list functionality.\nSpecifically, it shows the addition of:\n- a new middleware called `block_list.ts`\n- The `app.ts` file now uses this middleware.\n- The `utils.ts` file has been renamed to `formatUrlList` from `formatAllowList`\n- The allow list middleware and the block list middleware now correctly use `new URL().host` to check the domain of the url.\n- The .env.sample now includes a commented-out `BLOCK_LIST` option.",

The vulnerability allows an attacker to capture screenshots of internal web services, which is a form of SSRF.|\n| CWE-306 | Missing Authentication for Critical Function | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. The product does not perform authentication to restrict the ability to capture screenshots of web services.|\n| CWE-201 | Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data | 0.5 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate. Capturing screenshots of internal web services may lead to insertion of sensitive information into sent data.|\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery), which is a Base level CWE. It accurately describes the vulnerability where an attacker can cause the server to make requests to unintended locations (internal services in this case). CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is a possible secondary CWE, as the lack of authentication allows unauthorized screenshot captures. CWE-201 (Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data) is also considered, as the screenshots could contain sensitive information.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe918[\"CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n\n    cwe918 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe201\n    cwe306 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe918\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n\n    class cwe918 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of a default block list** in the `url-to-png` package. This leads to the possibility of **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** (CWE-918) as users can manipulate the URL parameter to capture screenshots of internal web services. If sensitive information is present in those internal services, it can result in **Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data** (CWE-201). The **Missing Authentication for Critical Function** (CWE-306) exacerbates this issue as it allows anyone to trigger the screenshot functionality without proper authorization.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE mapping to CWE-918 is based on the vulnerability description and CVE reference links. The core issue is that the `url-to-png` package, due to the **lack of a block list**, allows attackers to capture screenshots of other web services running locally on the server. This directly aligns with the description of SSRF, where the server retrieves the contents of a URL without proper validation. The vulnerability description key phrases \"capture screenshots of other web services running locally\" and the CVE reference links content summary specifically highlight the exposure of internal services as the main impact. While other CWEs were considered, CWE-918 best captures the root cause of the vulnerability. The confidence level is high (0.9) because there is direct evidence in the vulnerability description and CVE reference links.\n\nCWE-306 is a secondary candidate because the **missing authentication** allows unauthorized users to use the service, potentially capturing sensitive information. This is a contributing factor but not the primary weakness.\n\nCWE-201 is a tertiary candidate because the captured screenshots **may contain sensitive information**, but this is a consequence of the SSRF rather than the root cause.\n\nOther CWEs considered but not used:\n\n*   CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')): This was considered due to the manipulation of the URL parameter. However, the primary issue is not about injection but rather the server making requests to unintended locations. Therefore, CWE-918 is a better fit.\n*   CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type): This is not applicable as the vulnerability does not involve file uploads.\n*   CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function): While the product does not require authentication to take screenshots, the main issue is that the product by design, allows screenshots of localhost if no block list is specified.",
