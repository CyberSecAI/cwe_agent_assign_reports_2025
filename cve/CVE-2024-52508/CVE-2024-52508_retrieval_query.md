# Retrieval Query for CVE-2024-52508

## Vulnerability Description
Nextcloud Mail is the mail app for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. When a user is trying to set up a mail account with an email address like user@example.tld that does not support auto configuration, and an attacker managed to register autoconfig.tld, the used email details would be send to the server of the attacker. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Mail app is upgraded to 1.14.6, 1.15.4, 2.2.11, 3.6.3, 3.7.7 or 4.0.0.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** send user email details to attacker server
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** Nextcloud Mail

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Nextcloud Mail app's auto-configuration feature, when it cannot find an automatic configuration for a given email domain, falls back to querying a generic domain `autoconfig.tld`. If an attacker registers this domain, they can intercept the email details sent by the vulnerable Nextcloud instance.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The application sends sensitive email account details (including email address) to a third-party domain when auto-configuration fails.
- **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application does not validate if the fallback domain used for auto-configuration is legitimate, allowing it to be potentially hijacked.
- **Reliance on Potentially Unsafe Fallback:** The reliance on a generic domain (`autoconfig.tld`) for auto-configuration fallback is a design weakness, as it can be registered by anyone.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can gain access to users' email addresses and potentially other email account details, which can be used for various malicious purposes such as phishing or spam campaigns.
- **Potential for Phishing:** Attackers can use intercepted information to craft targeted phishing attacks.
- **Compromised Account Security:** The information disclosure could lead to compromised email accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploited over the network when a Nextcloud Mail app attempts to configure an account and the auto-configuration fails for the given domain.
- **DNS Hijacking:**  The attacker gains control of the domain `autoconfig.tld` to intercept requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Domain Registration:** The attacker needs to register the domain `autoconfig.tld` (or a similar domain used by the app) .
- **Network Access:** The attacker does not need access to the victim's network or system, just the ability to intercept DNS requests for `autoconfig.tld`.
- **User Interaction:** The user has to attempt to configure a mail account using an email address without a valid auto-configuration to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when no auto-configuration is found, not during normal operation.
- The fix involves not relying on the `autoconfig.tld` fallback mechanism by refactoring the DNS lookup and using a public suffix list, as seen in the provided commit.
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of the Nextcloud Mail app.
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as high.
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-200: Information Exposure.
- The fix was backported to multiple stable versions of the application.

# Complete CWE Specifications


## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

### Extended Description


Retrieval of a user record occurs in the system based on some key value that is under user control. The key would typically identify a user-related record stored in the system and would be used to lookup that record for presentation to the user. It is likely that an attacker would have to be an authenticated user in the system. However, the authorization process would not properly check the data access operation to ensure that the authenticated user performing the operation has sufficient entitlements to perform the requested data access, hence bypassing any other authorization checks present in the system.


For example, attackers can look at places where user specific data is retrieved (e.g. search screens) and determine whether the key for the item being looked up is controllable externally. The key may be a hidden field in the HTML form field, might be passed as a URL parameter or as an unencrypted cookie variable, then in each of these cases it will be possible to tamper with the key value.


One manifestation of this weakness is when a system uses sequential or otherwise easily-guessable session IDs that would allow one user to easily switch to another user's session and read/modify their data.


### Alternative Terms
Insecure Direct Object Reference / IDOR: The "Insecure Direct Object Reference" term, as described in the OWASP Top Ten, is broader than this CWE because it also covers path traversal (CWE-22). Within the context of vulnerability theory, there is a similarity between the OWASP concept and CWE-706: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference.
Broken Object Level Authorization / BOLA: BOLA is used in the 2019 OWASP API Security Top 10 and is said to be the same as IDOR.
Horizontal Authorization: "Horizontal Authorization" is used to describe situations in which two users have the same privilege level, but must be prevented from accessing each other's resources. This is fairly common when using key-based access to resources in a multi-user context.

- **CVE-2004-1513:** Spoofed entries in web server log file via carriage returns




## CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product generates an error message that includes sensitive information about its environment, users, or associated data.

### Extended Description


The sensitive information may be valuable information on its own (such as a password), or it may be useful for launching other, more serious attacks. The error message may be created in different ways:


  - self-generated: the source code explicitly constructs the error message and delivers it

  - externally-generated: the external environment, such as a language interpreter, handles the error and constructs its own message, whose contents are not under direct control by the programmer

An attacker may use the contents of error messages to help launch another, more focused attack. For example, an attempt to exploit a path traversal weakness (CWE-22) might yield the full pathname of the installed application. In turn, this could be used to select the proper number of ".." sequences to navigate to the targeted file. An attack using SQL injection (CWE-89) might not initially succeed, but an error message could reveal the malformed query, which would expose query logic and possibly even passwords or other sensitive information used within the query.

- **CVE-2008-4638:** Composite: application running with high privileges (CWE-250) allows user to specify a restricted file to process, which generates a parsing error that leaks the contents of the file (CWE-209).




## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

### Extended Description


Attackers may be able to bypass weak authentication faster and/or with less effort than expected.


### Alternative Terms
None

### Relationships

- **CVE-2022-35248:** Chat application skips validation when Central Authentication Service (CAS) is enabled, effectively removing the second factor from two-factor authentication
- **CVE-2021-3116:** Chain: Python-based HTTP Proxy server uses the wrong boolean operators (CWE-480) causing an incorrect comparison (CWE-697) that identifies an authN failure if all three conditions are met instead of only one, allowing bypass of the proxy authentication (CWE-1390)




## CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
**Abstraction:** Class
**Status:** Incomplete

### Description
The product establishes a communication channel to (or from) an endpoint for privileged or protected operations, but it does not properly ensure that it is communicating with the correct endpoint.

### Extended Description


Attackers might be able to spoof the intended endpoint from a different system or process, thus gaining the same level of access as the intended endpoint.


While this issue frequently involves authentication between network-based clients and servers, other types of communication channels and endpoints can have this weakness.

## CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.

### Extended Description
When a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between the host and client. The product might connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the product might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.

## CWE-322: Key Exchange without Entity Authentication
**Abstraction:** Base
**Status:** Draft

### Description
The product performs a key exchange with an actor without verifying the identity of that actor.

### Extended Description
Performing a key exchange will preserve the integrity of the information sent between two entities, but this will not guarantee that the entities are who they claim they are. This may enable an attacker to impersonate an actor by modifying traffic between the two entities. Typically, this involves a victim client that contacts a malicious server that is impersonating a trusted server. If the client skips authentication or ignores an authentication failure, the malicious server may request authentication information from the user. The malicious server can then use this authentication information to log in to the trusted server using the victim's credentials, sniff traffic between the victim and trusted server, etc.

### Alternative Terms
