  "description": "The WPIDE - File Manager & Code Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.9. This is due to the plugin utilizing the PHP-Parser library, which outputs parser rebuild command execution results. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9546:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability stems from the WPIDE plugin using the `PHP-Parser` library. The plugin outputs the results of the parser rebuild command execution. This output includes the full path of the web application, which is not intended to be exposed.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Full Path Disclosure:** The core weakness is that the plugin reveals the server's full file path due to the execution of the parser rebuild command which is part of the `PHP-Parser` library. The output of this command execution includes the full file path of the application. This information is unintentionally exposed to unauthenticated users.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the exposure of the web application's full file path. While this information is not directly exploitable on its own, it can be used by attackers to further their attacks.\n*   **Aiding Other Attacks:** The leaked path information can be a valuable asset for attackers in conjunction with other vulnerabilities. For example, it could be used to craft more effective attacks targeting specific files or directories within the application, potentially leading to further compromise.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network:** The attack vector is over the network. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.\n*   **Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability is unauthenticated which means no user credentials are required for the attack.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **No Special Privileges:** Attackers do not need any user accounts or privileges on the target system to exploit this vulnerability.\n*   **Remote Access:** Attackers need only network access to the vulnerable WordPress site.\n*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:**  Attackers need knowledge of the vulnerability to target it.\n\n**Additional Details from Wordfence Content**\n\n*   **CVE Information:** The CVE ID is CVE-2024-9546 and has a CVSS score of 5.3 (Medium).\n*   **Affected Versions:** All versions of the WPIDE plugin up to and including 3.4.9 are affected.\n*   **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is patched in version 3.5.0 and above.\n*   **Researcher:** The vulnerability was discovered by TANG Cheuk Hei (siunam).\n*   **Remediation:** The recommended remediation is to update the WPIDE plugin to version 3.5.0 or a newer patched version.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nCVE-2024-9546 is a medium severity vulnerability where the WPIDE plugin unintentionally exposes the full file path of the web application due to an output generated during the execution of the `PHP-Parser` library. This is exploitable without authentication and can be leveraged to aid other attacks.",

CWE-22 was also considered due to the path disclosure aspect, but is not a direct cause but an impact in this case. CWE-201 has relationships with CWE-212 (Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer), indicating a potential for improper handling of sensitive data before transmission. However, the vulnerability description is clear that the sensitive information is being inserted into sent data, which means that CWE-201 is the more appropriate option.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n\n    cwe212 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe201\n    cwe22 -->|PeerOf| cwe23\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe201 primary\n    class cwe22 secondary\n    class cwe212 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the plugin utilizing the PHP-Parser library which outputs parser rebuild command execution results. This output includes the full path of the web application, leading to **CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data**. The impact of this vulnerability is Full Path Disclosure, which allows attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application which can be used to aid other attacks. This is **CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**, but it is not a direct cause in this case.\n  - **Root Cause:** PHP-Parser library outputs parser rebuild command execution results containing the full path.\n  - **Weakness:** Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data (CWE-201)\n  - **Impact:** Full Path Disclosure (CWE-22)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the plugin's disclosure of the full path information. The `PHP-Parser` library's output includes the full path, which is then exposed. This lead to selecting CWE-201 because the **weakness** is the insertion of the full path (sensitive information) into sent data. The selection of CWE-201 is directly supported by the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, which states, \"The core weakness is that the plugin reveals the server's full file path due to the execution of the parser rebuild command\".\n\nI considered CWE-22, as it describes path traversal, but this vulnerability does not directly involve path traversal. Instead, it's a case of **Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data (CWE-201)** which can then *aid* in future path traversal attacks. Therefore, CWE-201 is the more accurate and specific classification.\n\nThe final decision is based on the evidence that the plugin is inserting sensitive path information into the output, leading to information disclosure. CWE-201 is at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n\n\n## CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as \"..\" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
