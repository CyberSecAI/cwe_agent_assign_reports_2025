The attacker can then use these credentials to access the JMX interface and perform unauthorized operations. This is same vulnerability that CVE-2020-13946 was issued for, but the Java option was changed in JDK10. This issue affects Apache Cassandra from 4.0.2 through 5.0.2 running Java 11. Operators are recommended to upgrade to a release equal to or later than 4.0.15, 4.1.8, or 5.0.3 which fixes the issue. Consider specifically these CWEs: CWE-22 CWE-319 CWE-306 CWE-269 CWE-294 CWE-250 CWE-522 CWE-200 CWE-287",
