## Vulnerability Description
**DLL Hijacking vulnerability** has been found in CENTUM CAMS Log server provided by Yokogawa Electric Corporation. If an attacker is somehow able to intrude into a computer that installed affected product or access to a shared folder, by replacing the DLL file with a tampered one, it is possible to execute arbitrary programs with the authority of the SYSTEM account. The affected products and versions are as follows CENTUM CS 3000 R3.08.10 to R3.09.50 CENTUM VP R4.01.00 to R4.03.00, R5.01.00 to R5.04.20, R6.01.00 to R6.11.10.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **DLL Hijacking vulnerability**
- **weakness:** **DLL hijacking**
- **impact:** arbitrary code execution and execute arbitrary programs
- **vector:** replacing DLL file
- **product:** ['CENTUM CS' and 'CENTUM VP']
- **version:** ['R3.08.10 to R3.09.50' and 'R4.01.00 to R4.03.00' and 'R5.01.00 to R5.04.20' and 'R6.01.00 to R6.11.10']
- **component:** CAMS Log server

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a DLL hijacking issue in the CENTUM CAMS Log server. An attacker can replace a legitimate DLL file with a malicious one.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control (CWE-284) is present, as the system loads DLLs from untrusted locations. This allows for DLL hijacking.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary programs with SYSTEM privileges. This can lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, system manipulation, and denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves an attacker gaining access to a computer with the affected product installed or accessing a shared folder. The attacker then replaces a legitimate DLL file with a tampered one.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires the ability to write to the file system where the vulnerable application loads DLLs, either by having local access to the machine or by having access to a network share. They also need to be able to craft a malicious DLL.
