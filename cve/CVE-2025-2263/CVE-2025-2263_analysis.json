The vulnerability description clearly states a stack-based buffer overflow, making the variant a more precise choice than the class. CWE-120 is also related to buffer overflows, but the description explicitly mentions the overflow occurs during decryption using EVP_DecryptUpdate which writes to a stack-based buffer.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe120[\"CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')\"]\n    \n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe120 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe119,cwe120 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **stack-based buffer overflow** (CWE-121) due to the `EVP_DecryptUpdate` function writing beyond the allocated buffer size when decrypting the username or password.
