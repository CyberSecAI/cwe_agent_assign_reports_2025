## Vulnerability Description
i-Educar is free, fully online school management software that can be used by school secretaries, teachers, coordinators, and area managers. Prior to the 2.9 branch, an attacker with only minimal viewing privileges in the settings section is able to change their user type to Administrator (or another type with super-permissions) through a specifically crafted POST request to `/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php`, modifying the `nivel_usuario_` parameter. The vulnerability occurs in the file located at `ieducar/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php`, which does not check the users current permission level before allowing changes. Commit c25910cdf11ab50e50162a49dd44bef544422b6e contains a patch for the issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper access control**
- **impact:** change user type to Administrator
- **vector:** specifically crafted POST request
- **attacker:** attacker with minimal viewing privileges
- **product:** i-Educar
- **version:** prior to 2.9 branch
- **component:** /intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control in the `ieducar/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php` file. Specifically, the application fails to verify if a user has sufficient privileges to modify their own user type. Any user with the permission to view user type configurations can exploit this flaw to elevate their privileges to an administrator by manipulating the `nivel_usuario_` parameter during a user update.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Broken Access Control (CWE-269):** The primary weakness is the insufficient authorization check, allowing users to perform actions they shouldn't be permitted to do.
-   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** Although not explicitly stated, the lack of proper input validation for the `nivel_usuario_` parameter allows the attacker to inject an arbitrary user type.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged user can escalate their privileges to administrator.
-   **Account Takeover:** With admin rights, an attacker can take over accounts, modify administrative tasks, and perform other malicious actions.
-   **Data Modification and Loss:** Attackers can potentially modify or delete sensitive data.
-   **System Compromise:** The entire system is vulnerable to compromise due to unauthorized access and control.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
-   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `ieducar/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php`, manipulating the `nivel_usuario_` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs only low-level user access with permission to view user type configurations.
-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application.
-   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the URL of `ieducar/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php`

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability is present in version 2.9 of the i-Educar software.
-   The vulnerable code is located at `ieducar/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php`, specifically around line 446.
-   The provided PoC (Proof of Concept) demonstrates how a low-privilege user can change their user type to "Administrator" by sending a POST request with the `nivel_usuario_` parameter set to the administrator's ID (1 in this case).
-   The fix was implemented in commit `c25910c`, which adds a `canChange` function that validates if the current user has the required permissions to change the user type.
-   The `canChange` method allows modification if:
    1.  The user making the change is an admin.
    2.  The user being changed doesn't exist.
    3.  The user being changed is not an admin.
-   The fix implements an access control check, preventing unauthorized privilege escalation.
-   CVSS v3 score is 8.1 (High).

This detailed analysis provides a clear understanding of the vulnerability, its exploitation, and the necessary steps to mitigate it.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

---

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

## Summary – Quick LLM Rules of Thumb

| **Indicator**                                              | **Likely CWE** |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| No identity check (no login)                               | CWE-306        |
| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |



### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**
