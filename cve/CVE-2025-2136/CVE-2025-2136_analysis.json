The retriever results listed several other CWEs, most notably CWE-366 **CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread**, CWE-843 **CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')**, and CWE-415 **CWE-415: Double Free**. However, the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"use after free\" making CWE-416 the most appropriate and specific choice. The other CWEs don't fit the description as well.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe416[\"CWE-416: Use After Free\"]\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe416 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **use after free** condition (CWE-416 **CWE-416: Use After Free**), potentially leading to heap corruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly states a \"use after free\" condition. The retriever results also highlighted CWE-416 **CWE-416: Use After Free** as the top candidate. Given the direct mention in the description and the retriever results, CWE-416 is the most appropriate mapping. Other CWEs like CWE-366 **CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread**, CWE-843 **CWE-843: Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')**, and CWE-415 **CWE-415: Double Free** were considered but not selected because the description clearly points to a **use after free** vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-416: Use After Free\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product reuses or references memory after it has been freed.
