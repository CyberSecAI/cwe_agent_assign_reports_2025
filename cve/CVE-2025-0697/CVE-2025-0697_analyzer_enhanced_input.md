## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in Telstra Smart Modem Gen 2 up to 20250115. This affects an unknown part of the component HTTP Header Handler. The manipulation of the argument Content-Disposition leads to injection. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** injection
- **vector:** manipulation of Content-Disposition argument
- **product:** Telstra Smart Modem Gen 2
- **version:** up to 20250115
- **component:** HTTP Header Handler

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The content relates to a vulnerability in the Telstra Smart Modem Gen 2, specifically an unauthenticated HTTP Response Header Injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
User-supplied data being unsafely copied into the Content-Disposition response header without proper validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- HTTP Response Header Injection
- Lack of input validation/sanitization

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Manipulation of HTTP headers
- Injection of malicious payloads into server responses
- Potential for setting malicious cookies and injecting HTML/JavaScript into the response body.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted HTTP GET request targeting resources like `robots.txt` with a malicious payload embedded in the URL path (e.g., `/robots.txtcy4y9%0d%0ai3o0z`).
- Utilizing the `%0d%0a` sequence to break out of the expected header structure and inject new headers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Unauthenticated attacker
- Ability to craft and send HTTP requests

**Mitigation or fix:**
- Sanitize all user-supplied input before incorporating it into HTTP headers.
- Reject input containing control characters or unsafe combinations.
- Encode user input to neutralize special characters before including it in headers.

**More detail than official CVE description:**
Yes, the content provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including a specific example of a malicious request and the resulting malformed response. It also outlines mitigation strategies.
