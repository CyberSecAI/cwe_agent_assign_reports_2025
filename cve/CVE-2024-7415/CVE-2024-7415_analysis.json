  "cve_id": "CVE-2024-7415",
  "description": "The Remember Me Controls plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.1. This is due to the plugin allowing direct access to the bootstrap.php file which has display_errors on. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-7415\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability is caused by the plugin's `bootstrap.php` file having `display_errors` set to `on` and being directly accessible.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Full Path Disclosure:** The direct access to `bootstrap.php` reveals the full server path of the web application due to the enabled `display_errors`. This is considered an information disclosure vulnerability.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Information Leakage:** An attacker can obtain the full path of the web application.\n- **Aids other attacks:** The disclosed path can be used to gain information about the server environment and potentially assist in other attacks by revealing file locations. However, the path itself doesn't allow direct compromise of the website.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Direct web access to the `bootstrap.php` file.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- Unauthenticated access.\n- No special privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.\n- The attacker only needs to access the vulnerable `bootstrap.php` file.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability exists in Remember Me Controls plugin versions up to and including 2.0.1.\n- The vulnerability was addressed in version 2.1 of the plugin.\n- The Wordfence article mentions that the disclosed information is not useful on its own and requires another vulnerability to be present for significant damage to an affected website.\n- The fix in version 2.1 appears to include hardening to \"Prevent direct web access to `bootstrap.php`\" as mentioned in the changelog.\n\nThe provided content gives more context than the CVE description placeholder, providing details about the affected software, the vulnerability, its impact, and the fix.",
