  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved xfrm state fix **out-of-bounds read** during lookup lookup and resize can run in parallel. The xfrm_state_hash_generation seqlock ensures a retry, but the hash functions can observe a hmask value that is too large for the new hlist array. rehash does rcu_assign_pointer(net->xfrm.state_bydst, ndst) [..] net->xfrm.state_hmask = nhashmask While state lookup does h = xfrm_dst_hash(net, daddr, saddr, tmpl->reqid, encap_family) hlist_for_each_entry_rcu(x, net->xfrm.state_bydst + h, bydst) { This is only safe in case the update to state_bydst is larger than net->xfrm.xfrm_state_hmask (or if the lookup function gets serialized via state spinlock again). Fix this by prefetching state_hmask and the associated pointers. The xfrm_state_hash_generation seqlock retry will ensure that the pointer and the hmask will be consistent. The existing helpers, like xfrm_dst_hash(), are now unsafe for RCU side, add lockdep assertions to document that they are only safe for insert side. xfrm_state_lookup_byaddr() uses the spinlock rather than RCU. AFAICS this is an oversight from back when state lookup was converted to RCU, this lock should be replaced with RCU in a future patch.",

The **CWE-125** is a base level CWE and **CWE-362** is a Class level CWE. There is no child CWE for **CWE-362** that would fit better. The relationship between the concurrent execution and the out-of-bounds read isn't a direct parent-child, but rather a condition that enables the read to occur, leading to a complex scenario.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n\n    cwe125 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe362 --.->|CAUSES| cwe125\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe125 primary\n    class cwe362 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race condition** (**CWE-362**) during lookup and resize operations on xfrm states. This leads to the hash functions observing a hmask value that is too large for the new hlist array, resulting in an **out-of-bounds read** (**CWE-125**) when accessing memory.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary **weakness** is an **out-of-bounds read** (**CWE-125**) in the Linux kernel's xfrm state lookup functionality. This **weakness** is triggered by a **race condition** (**CWE-362**) that occurs during the resize operation, where the hash functions can observe an inconsistent state, leading to the **out-of-bounds read**.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-125** is directly supported by the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions \"xfrm state fix **out-of-bounds read** during lookup lookup and resize can run in parallel.\" The retriever results also list **CWE-125** as a highly relevant CWE.\n\nThe decision to include **CWE-362** is based on the description of the parallel execution of lookup and resize operations, which creates a **race condition** where the hash functions can observe an inconsistent state. Although **CWE-362** is a class-level CWE, no more specific base-level CWE accurately captures the concurrency issue described.\n\nOther CWEs such as **CWE-476** (NULL Pointer Dereference), **CWE-770** (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling), and **CWE-908** (Use of Uninitialized Resource) were considered but deemed less relevant as the core issue is the **out-of-bounds read** caused by the **race condition**, rather than a null pointer, resource exhaustion, or uninitialized resource.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs
