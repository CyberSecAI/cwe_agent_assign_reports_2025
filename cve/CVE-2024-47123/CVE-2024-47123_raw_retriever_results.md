# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-47123

# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-47123
## Query
The goTenna Pro App uses AES CTR type encryption for short, encrypted messages without any additional integrity checking mechanisms. This leaves messages malleable to an attacker that can access the message. It is recommended to continue to use encryption in the app and update to the current release for more secure operations.

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'lack of message integrity checking'
