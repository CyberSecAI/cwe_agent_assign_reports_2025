Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file /index.php?app=main&inc=feature_firewall&op=firewall_list of the component Template Handler. The manipulation of the argument IP address with the input {{`id`} leads to injection. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier VDB-270277 was assigned to this vulnerability. NOTE The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

The vulnerability involves the **improper neutralization of special elements** within a template engine, leading to code injection. CWE-94 is a parent of CWE-1336 and represents a more general class of code injection vulnerabilities. While code injection is the ultimate impact, the root cause lies in the improper handling of template elements. Therefore, CWE-1336 is chosen as the primary CWE due to its greater specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1336[\"CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine\"]\n    cwe94[\"CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe1336 -->|CHILDOF| cwe94\n    cwe94 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1336 primary\n    class cwe94 secondary\n    class cwe74 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper neutralization of special elements** within the template engine (CWE-1336). This leads to the ability to inject code (CWE-94), which can then be executed on the server, leading to arbitrary code execution and a compromise of the system.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, specifically the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" which states \"The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the IP addresses field when creating or editing firewall rules, allowing for Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI).\" and \"An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.\"\n\nThe selection of CWE-1336 is based on its precise description matching the SSTI vulnerability. The retriever results also list CWE-1336 as a highly relevant candidate. While CWE-94 (Code Injection) is a related and potential consequence, CWE-1336 represents the **root cause** more accurately.\n\nThe evidence clearly points to the **improper handling of template elements**, making CWE-1336 the optimal choice. CWE-94 is considered a secondary candidate because it represents the broader category of code injection vulnerabilities. The graph relationships helped in understanding the hierarchical relationship, reinforcing the decision to choose the more specific CWE-1336.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not selected:* This CWE is about encoding/escaping issues when communicating between components, which isn't the primary issue here. The core problem is the lack of sanitization within the template engine itself.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n*Not selected:* This is a high-level CWE, and more specific CWEs like CWE-1336 and CWE-78 are more appropriate because they target specific injection types.\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected:* This is related to XSS, which is about injecting code into a web page viewed by other users.

It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not selected:* Similar to CWE-74, this is too high-level.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not selected:* This is an authorization issue, which isn't the problem here. The issue is that a template engine is improperly secured.\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not selected:* This is a more general filtering issue.
