# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-1544

## Description

Generating the ECDSA nonce k samples a random number r and then truncates this randomness with a modular reduction mod n where n is the order of the elliptic curve. Meaning k = r mod n. The division used during the reduction estimates a factor q_e by dividing the upper two digits (a digit having e.g. a size of 8 byte) of r by the upper digit of n and then decrements q_e in a loop until it has the correct size. Observing the number of times q_e is decremented through a control-flow revealing side-channel reveals a bias in the most significant bits of k. Depending on the curve this is either a negligible bias or a significant bias large enough to reconstruct k with lattice reduction methods. For SECP160R1, e.g., we find a bias of 15 bits.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Weakness:** truncation of randomness for ECDSA nonce k
- **Impact:** bias in most significant bits of k
- **Vector:** side-channel attack

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-197 | Numeric Truncation Error | 0.9 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-208 | Observable Timing Discrepancy | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is the truncation of the random number which is represented by CWE-197. The truncation process involves a division operation, and the number of times the quotient is decremented is observable through a side-channel, leading to CWE-208. CWE-197 is the root cause, while CWE-208 is a consequence of the implementation. The hierarchical relationships are not directly applicable here, but the chain relationship shows that the truncation can lead to observable timing discrepancies.

## Vulnerability Chain
1.  **Root Cause:** CWE-197 Numeric Truncation Error due to the modular reduction of the random number.
2.  **Weakness:** The division used during the reduction leaks information through control flow.
3.  **Impact:** CWE-208 Observable Timing Discrepancy reveals a bias in the most significant bits of k, potentially leading to the compromise of the ECDSA private key.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is primarily based on the provided evidence, particularly the CVE Reference Links Content Summary and the Vulnerability Description. The core issue is the **truncation of randomness** which is a **numeric truncation error**. This is then amplified by the observable timing discrepancy during the calculation. The retriever results also pointed to these CWEs.

The most relevant snippet of evidence is: "The vulnerability stems from how ECDSA nonces (k) are generated in wolfSSL before version 5.6.6. The process involves sampling a random number (r) and then **truncating** it using a modular reduction modulo n, where n is the order of the elliptic curve."

The CWEs are selected at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-197 directly addresses the truncation error, while CWE-208 captures the side-channel aspect of the vulnerability.
