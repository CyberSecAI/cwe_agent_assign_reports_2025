  "description": "Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. An **unsafe reading of environment file** could potentially cause a denial of service in Netty. When loaded on an Windows application, Netty attempts to load a file that does not exist. If an attacker creates such a large file, the Netty application crashes. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.1.115.",

CWE-770 has a parent-child relationship with CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption), which is a Class-level CWE. The vulnerability described involves an attacker creating a large file that the application attempts to load into memory, leading to resource exhaustion and a denial of service. CWE-770 directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, while CWE-400 describes the broader impact.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **unsafe reading of environment files** (triggered by attempting to read Linux-specific files on Windows) and the lack of input validation on the file size. This leads to the Netty application attempting to allocate an excessive amount of memory, resulting in an out-of-memory error and a denial of service.\n\n*   Root Cause: **Unsafe reading of environment files** and lack of input validation\n*   Weakness: CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling)\n*   Impact: Denial of Service (DoS) through uncontrolled resource consumption\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE identified is CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling). This selection is based on the vulnerability description, which highlights that the Netty application attempts to load a potentially large, attacker-controlled file into memory without proper size validation. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the root cause involves **unsafe reading of environment files** without proper OS verification and lack of input validation, leading to excessive memory allocation. The fix mentioned, implementing a `BoundedInputStream` to limit the data read, directly addresses the lack of resource control.\n\nCWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) was considered as a potential candidate but was deemed to be a higher-level abstraction of the issue. The more specific CWE-770 accurately captures the root cause related to uncontrolled memory allocation.\n\nThe decision is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description, the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\", and the relationship between CWE-770 and CWE-400. The selection of CWE-770 is at the optimal level of specificity, providing a clear understanding of the vulnerability's root cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nOpening temporary files without appropriate measures or controls can leave the file, its contents and any function that it impacts vulnerable to attack.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
