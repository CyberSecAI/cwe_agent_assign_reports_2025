  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved NFSv4 Fix a deadlock when recovering state on a sillyrenamed file If the file is sillyrenamed, and slated for delete on close, it is possible for a server reboot to triggeer an open reclaim, with can again **race** with the application call to close(). When that happens, the call to put_nfs_open_context() can trigger a synchronous delegreturn call which deadlocks because it is not marked as privileged. Instead, ensure that the call to nfs4_inode_return_delegation_on_close() catches the delegreturn, and schedules it asynchronously.",

While CWE-362 describes the general class of **race** conditions, CWE-833 pinpoints the specific outcome. The hierarchical relationship of CWE-362 being a class, and CWE-833 being at the base level, also influenced the decision to prioritize CWE-833 as the primary weakness due to its higher specificity.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe833[\"CWE-833: Deadlock\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    \n    cwe833 -- CANFOLLOW --> cwe362\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe833 primary\n    class cwe362 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **race** condition (CWE-362) during the recovery of state on a sillyrenamed file in NFSv4. This **race** condition leads to a deadlock (CWE-833) when the call to `put_nfs_open_context()` triggers a synchronous delegreturn call without being marked as privileged. The root cause is the improper synchronization, and the impact is the deadlock.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis considered both CWE-362 and CWE-833 due to the presence of a **race** condition and a deadlock. However, the vulnerability description explicitly states that the **race** leads to a deadlock. Therefore, CWE-833 is the more specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability's primary impact. The evidence is found in the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" where the **weakness** is a **race** and the **impact** is a deadlock.\n\nThe final selection of CWE-833 as the primary CWE is based on its ability to precisely describe the vulnerability's outcome. CWE-362 is included as a secondary CWE to acknowledge the presence of the **race** condition that triggers the deadlock. Both CWEs are at appropriate levels of specificity, with CWE-833 at the base level and CWE-362 as a Class.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
