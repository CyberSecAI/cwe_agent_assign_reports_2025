# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-8210

## Description

A vulnerability was found in D-Link DNS-120, DNR-202L, DNS-315L, DNS-320, DNS-320L, DNS-320LW, DNS-321, DNR-322L, DNS-323, DNS-325, DNS-326, DNS-327L, DNR-326, DNS-340L, DNS-343, DNS-345, DNS-726-4, DNS-1100-4, DNS-1200-05 and DNS-1550-04 up to 20240814. It has been classified as critical. This affects the function sprintf of the file /cgi-bin/hd_config.cgi. The manipulation of the argument f_mount leads to **command injection**. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. NOTE This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. NOTE Vendor was contacted early and confirmed that the product is end-of-life. It should be retired and replaced.

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship considered was the parent-child relationship between CWE-77 (Command Injection) and CWE-78 (OS Command Injection). CWE-78 was selected as it is a more specific case of command injection, targeting OS commands. The tool's retriever results showed both as strong candidates, but since the vulnerability description explicitly mentions OS commands, CWE-78 was favored.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper neutralization** of the `f_mount` argument, leading to **command injection**. The root cause is the lack of input sanitization before the input is used in a `sprintf` function, which is then passed to a `system` command. This allows for the execution of arbitrary commands on the device.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is heavily based on the provided evidence, which explicitly mentions **command injection** via manipulation of the `f_mount` argument in the `/cgi-bin/hd_config.cgi` file. The **root cause** is the **lack of sanitization** of this input before it's used in a `sprintf` function and then passed to a `system` command.

The vulnerability description key phrases state: "**weakness:** **command injection**". The "CVE Reference Links Content Summary" states that the "**f_mount** variable from a POST request is used in a **sprintf** function which is then passed to a **system** command" and that "**user-controlled input (`f_mount`) is passed to a system command without sanitization**."

The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-77 and CWE-78, with the latter being a more specific instance of the former.

The selection of CWE-78 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it directly addresses the vulnerability involving OS commands.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.77
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of a command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended command when it is sent to a downstream component.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: CWE-77 is often misused when OS command injection (CWE-78) was intended instead [REF-1287].

I considered CWE-77, but it is a class level CWE while CWE-78 is a Base level CWE. Also the description specifically mentions OS commands so CWE-78 is a better fit. The rationale for CWE-77 states that it's often misused when OS command injection is intended, further supporting the selection of CWE-78.
