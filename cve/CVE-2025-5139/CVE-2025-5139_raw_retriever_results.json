  "query": "A vulnerability was found in Qualitor 8.20/8.24. It has been rated as critical. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the file /html/ad/adconexaooffice365/request/testaConexaoOffice365.php of the component Office 365-type Connection Handler. The manipulation of the argument nmconexao leads to command injection. The attack may be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 8.20.56 and 8.24.31 is able to address this issue. It is recommended to upgrade the affected component.",
