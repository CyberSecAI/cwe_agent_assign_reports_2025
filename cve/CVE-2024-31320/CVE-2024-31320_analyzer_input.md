# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-31320

## Vulnerability Description
In setSkipPrompt of AssociationRequest.java , there is a possible way to establish a companion device association without any confirmation due to **CDM**. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **CDM**
- **impact:** establish a companion device association without any confirmation and local escalation of privilege
- **component:** setSkipPrompt of AssociationRequest.java

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-31320:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Android handles the `setSkipPrompt` function, allowing third-party applications to bypass user prompts. Specifically, it appears that a third-party application could improperly use the `setSkipPrompt` function to bypass user interaction/prompts that would otherwise be required.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Authorization/Access Control:** A third-party application could potentially manipulate a system function, `setSkipPrompt`, in an unintended way.
- **Bypassed Security Mechanism:**  The vulnerability allows bypassing prompts that are designed to ensure user awareness and consent for actions that should require user intervention.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Local Escalation of Privilege (EoP):** An attacker could potentially elevate their privileges by exploiting this vulnerability. The provided security bulletin explicitly states: "The most severe vulnerability in this section could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed."
- **Bypass of User Prompts:** Third-party apps could potentially skip critical user prompts, which would allow them to perform unauthorized actions without the user's explicit consent or awareness.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Third-Party Application Exploitation:** A malicious application, or an application with unintended vulnerabilities, could exploit this flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Installed Application:** The attacker would need to have a malicious application (or an app with a vulnerability) installed on the targeted device.
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability is a local EoP, meaning that the attacker would have to have a locally running application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this issue is mentioned with bug ID `A-329230490` and is found in the AOSP commit link provided in the security bulletin.
- The commit message "[DO NOT MERGE][CDM] Fix a security issue that allow 3p apps to skip prompt by setSkipPrompt" further confirms the vulnerability.
- This vulnerability is classified as "Critical" in the security bulletin.
- Affected AOSP versions are 12 and 12L.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
