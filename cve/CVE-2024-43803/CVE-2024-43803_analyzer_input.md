# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-43803

## Vulnerability Description
The Bare Metal Operator (BMO) implements a Kubernetes API for managing bare metal hosts in Metal3. The `BareMetalHost` (BMH) CRD allows the `userData`, `metaData`, and `networkData` for the provisioned host to be specified as links to Kubernetes Secrets. There are fields for both the `Name` and `Namespace` of the Secret, meaning that versions of the baremetal-operator prior to 0.8.0, 0.6.2, and 0.5.2 will read a `Secret` from any namespace. A user with access to create or edit a `BareMetalHost` can thus exfiltrate a `Secret` from another namespace by using it as e.g. the `userData` for provisioning some host (note that this need not be a real host, it could be a VM somewhere). BMO will only read a key with the name `value` (or `userData`, `metaData`, or `networkData`), so that limits the exposure somewhat. `value` is probably a pretty common key though. Secrets used by _other_ `BareMetalHost`s in different namespaces are always vulnerable. It is probably relatively unusual for anyone other than cluster administrators to have RBAC access to create/edit a `BareMetalHost`. This vulnerability is only meaningful, if the cluster has users other than administrators and users privileges are limited to their respective namespaces. The patch prevents BMO from accepting links to Secrets from other namespaces as BMH input. Any BMH configuration is only read from the same namespace only. The problem is patched in BMO releases v0.7.0, v0.6.2 and v0.5.2 and users should upgrade to those

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **BMO allowing to specify userData, metaData, and networkData for the provisioned host to be specified as links to Kubernetes Secrets**
- **impact:** read a Secret from any namespace
- **attacker:** user with access to create or edit a BareMetalHost
- **product:** Baremetal Operator
- **version:** prior to 0.8.0, 0.6.2, and 0.5.2
- **component:** BareMetalHost CRD

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-43803:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `baremetal-operator`'s BareMetalHost (BMH) Custom Resource Definition (CRD) allowed specifying `userData`, `metaData`, and `networkData` via links to Kubernetes Secrets. The operator would fetch these secrets based on the provided `Name` and `Namespace`, without restricting access based on the namespace of the host.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Namespace Secret Access:** The operator could read secrets from any namespace, not just the namespace of the `BareMetalHost` resource. This violated the principle of least privilege and allowed potential information disclosure.
- **Unrestricted Secret Key Access:** Although limited to keys named `value`, `userData`, `metaData`, or `networkData`, these are common keys and could potentially expose sensitive data if present in a secret.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker with the ability to create or edit `BareMetalHost` resources in a namespace could exfiltrate secret data from other namespaces by referencing those secrets via a crafted BMH definition. The secret data could include credentials, configuration data, or other sensitive information.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the stolen secrets provided access to other resources or services, this could lead to further privilege escalation or lateral movement within the cluster.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious BMH Creation/Modification:** An attacker creates or modifies a `BareMetalHost` resource, specifying a secret from another namespace as a source for `userData`, `metaData`, or `networkData`.
- **Data Retrieval:** Upon host provisioning, the operator will fetch the secret data and expose the data via the provisioned host, allowing the attacker to retrieve the secret's content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Kubernetes Access:** The attacker needs to have RBAC privileges allowing the creation or modification of `BareMetalHost` resources. This typically requires access to the Kubernetes API within a specific namespace.
- **Awareness of Target Secrets:** The attacker needs some awareness of secrets in other namespaces with keys that can be read by `baremetal-operator`  (`value`, `userData`, `metaData`, or `networkData`).

**Mitigation:**
The fix implemented restricts secret fetching to only secrets located in the same namespace as the `BareMetalHost` resource. Patched versions of the baremetal-operator include v0.8.0, v0.6.2, and v0.5.2

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided data indicates that the vulnerability was addressed via pull requests #1929, #1930 and #1931 in the `metal3-io/baremetal-operator` repository.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 4.9 (Moderate) with base metrics indicating network attack vector, low complexity, high privileges required, no user interaction, unchanged scope, high confidentiality impact, and no integrity or availability impact.
- The vulnerability is also tracked as GHSA-pqfh-xh7w-7h3p in GitHub advisories.
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-200 (Information Exposure) and CWE-653 (Insufficient Authorization).

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set ‚Äì Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* üîç *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* üîç *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion ‚Äì CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### üî∏ CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúA user created with the ‚Äòguest‚Äô role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúThe backup service runs as root but only needs read access.‚Äù*

#### üî∏ CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### üî∏ CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ‚úÖ *‚ÄúUser can access another user‚Äôs invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.‚Äù*

## Mapping Examples ‚Äì Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *‚ÄúUser can escalate privileges to admin.‚Äù*
> ‚ùå Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged ‚Äì only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ‚úÖ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**
