  "description": "Vulnerability in the MySQL Cluster product of Oracle MySQL (component Cluster NDBCluster Plugin). Supported versions that are affected are 8.0.0-8.0.41, 8.4.0-8.4.4 and 9.0.0-9.2.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Cluster. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Cluster.

The vulnerability leads to a DOS by allowing a high privileged attacker to cause a hang or crash. |\n| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.5 | Class | Allowed | Secondary candidate. CWE-770 is a child of CWE-400 and is a more precise match |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship impacting the decision is the parent-child relationship between CWE-400 and CWE-770. CWE-770 is a more specific case of uncontrolled resource consumption, focusing on the allocation of resources without limits. While CWE-400 describes the general case, CWE-770 more precisely captures the allocation aspect described in the vulnerability. Other relationships, such as those for path traversal or SQL injection, are irrelevant to this vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a high-privileged attacker with network access, exploiting a flaw in the MySQL Cluster NDBCluster Plugin. This leads to a **lack of resource control**, specifically in the allocation of resources, resulting in a hang or repeatable crash, which is a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description. The description indicates that an attacker can cause a denial-of-service by exploiting a vulnerability in the MySQL Cluster component. The key aspect is the attacker's ability to cause a hang or crash, which directly relates to resource exhaustion.\n\nThe selection of CWE-770 is primarily driven by its specific focus on uncontrolled resource allocation, aligning with the observed behavior of the vulnerability. The retriever results also suggest the relevance of CWE-770, although it doesn't appear as a top result. This suggests that the vulnerability's core characteristic is related to resource allocation, leading to the DoS condition.\n\nThe other CWEs considered, such as SQL injection or path traversal, are not relevant to the vulnerability based on the provided information. The final decision is based on matching the vulnerability's impact (DoS) with the mechanism (**uncontrolled resource allocation**), leading to the selection of CWE-770 as the primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
