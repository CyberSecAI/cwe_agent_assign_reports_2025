This CWE describes a situation where the product does not properly validate an array index, leading to potential out-of-bounds access.\n\nThe **out of bounds write** is a symptom of the root cause, which leads to CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).\n\nCWE-129 is at the Variant level of abstraction and accurately represents the weakness.
