The retriever results suggested considering its parent class CWE-922 **Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information**, and its parent class CWE-311 **Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data**, but the description is specifically about cleartext storage, making CWE-312 the most appropriate and specific choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe922[\"CWE-922: Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n    \n    cwe312 -->|CHILDOF| cwe922\n    cwe922 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe312 primary\n    class cwe922,cwe311 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain consists of a single step: the **root cause** is **cleartext storage of sensitive information** (CWE-312), which directly leads to the potential impact of unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly states that sensitive customer information is stored without encryption.\n\nThe retriever results suggested a few CWEs, including:\n*   CWE-312 **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information**\n*   CWE-311 **Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data**\n*   CWE-922 **Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information**\n\nCWE-312 is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability. CWE-311 is a broader category and is discouraged when more specific options are available. CWE-922 is also a broader category encompassing insecure storage, but the vulnerability is specifically about cleartext storage.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly reflects the **root cause** of the vulnerability: the **lack of encryption** leading to **cleartext storage**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.80\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
