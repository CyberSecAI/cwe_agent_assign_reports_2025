Top plugin lacks nonce validation and proper file type validation.\\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n    - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\\n    - Arbitrary File Upload\\n- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated attackers can upload arbitrary files to the affected server, potentially leading to remote code execution if a site administrator is tricked into performing an action (e.g., clicking a link).\\n- **Attack vectors:** A forged request triggered by a victim's action, such as clicking a link, can be used to exploit the CSRF vulnerability and upload arbitrary files.\\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n    - Attackers need to be able to trick a site administrator into performing an action that triggers the forged request.\\n    - Attackers do not need to be authenticated.\", similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {95: {'cwe_counts': defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {}), 'total_samples': 1, 'distribution': [{'cwes': [], 'frequency': 1, 'proportion': 1.0}]},

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    The ScrollTo Top plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery to **Arbitrary File Upload** in versions up to, and including, 1.2.2. This is due to missing nonce validation and missing file type validation in the options_page function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: '['missing nonce validation''\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
