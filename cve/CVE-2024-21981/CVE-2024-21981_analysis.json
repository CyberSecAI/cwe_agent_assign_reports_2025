This suggests that this vulnerability is a secondary exploit, requiring a previous exploit to be successful.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- Local access to the system.\n- Prior arbitrary code execution within the ASP.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- The document explicitly mentions this vulnerability requires a separate, already fixed ASP firmware vulnerability to be exploited, so an attacker would first need to achieve code execution within ASP using a different vulnerability.\n- The severity is rated as medium with a CVSS score of 5.7.\n- There is no fix planned for this vulnerability in the provided mitigation information for EPYC processors.\n- The vulnerability is acknowledged to have been reported by Hugo Magalhaes, Oracle Security Researcher.",

It relates to using hard-coded cryptographic keys. CWE-285 is a class-level CWE related to improper authorization, but it's a less specific fit than CWE-321.

The **CVE Reference Links Content Summary** confirms that the vulnerability stems from **improper key usage control** within the AMD Secure Processor (ASP). This can be interpreted as either a hardcoded key or improper use of the key that leads to exposure. The retriever results also list CWE-321 as a candidate.\n\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization) was considered as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability involves unauthorized access to cryptographic keys.

The \"Variant\" level of abstraction is appropriate as it is more specific than the Class or Base levels.\n\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization): This CWE was considered because the vulnerability involves unauthorized access to cryptographic keys.
