## Vulnerability Description
vmir e8117 was discovered to contain a **stack overflow** via the init_local_vars function at /src/vmir_wasm_parser.c.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack overflow**
- **product:** vmir e8117
- **component:** init_local_vars function at /src/vmir_wasm_parser.c

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-35426:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack overflow in the `init_local_vars` function within the `/src/vmir_wasm_parser.c` file of the `vmir` project.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `init_local_vars` function. This occurs when processing a crafted WebAssembly (wasm) file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The overflow can also cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted WebAssembly (.wasm) file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide the vulnerable application with a malicious WASM file.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability stems from a stack buffer overflow within the `init_local_vars` function, triggered during the parsing of a malformed WASM file.  An attacker can leverage this to achieve remote code execution or cause a denial of service. The provided information is more detailed than the official CVE description placeholder, including specific function names, affected files, and the type of vulnerability.
