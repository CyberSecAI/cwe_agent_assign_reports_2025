## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
CVE-2025-27103: Dataease Mysql JDBC Connection Parameters Not Verified Leads to Arbitrary File Read Vulnerability

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The JDBC connection string returned by the `getJdbc()` function is not URL decoded, allowing for bypass of parameter checks. Specifically, the code fails to properly decode URL-encoded characters in the `extraParams` string, enabling malicious parameters to be injected.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Improper input validation: The application does not properly validate the JDBC connection parameters, specifically failing to URL decode the `extraParams` string.
*   Arbitrary file read: This vulnerability allows authenticated users to read arbitrary files on the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Authenticated users can read and deserialize arbitrary files through the background JDBC connection.

**Attack vectors:**

1.  An attacker can craft a malicious JDBC connection string with URL-encoded parameters that bypass the parameter checks.
2.  The attacker sends a request with the crafted JDBC string.
3.  The application constructs the JDBC URL without proper decoding, allowing the malicious parameters to be included.
4.  The attacker can then leverage the vulnerability to read arbitrary files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must be an authenticated user.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   Upgrade to version 2.10.6 or later, which includes a fix for this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `io.dataease.dto.datasource.MysqlConfiguration`.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by N1etzsche0 and coordinated by yulate and h3h3qaq.
*   The vulnerability is related to a re-bypass for the patch for CVE-2024-55953.
*   CWEs are not specified in the advisory.
