  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ext4 update orig_path in ext4_find_extent() In ext4_find_extent(), if the path is not big enough, we free it and set *orig_path to NULL. But after reallocating and successfully initializing the path, we dont update *orig_path, in which case the caller gets a valid path but a NULL ppath, and this may cause a **NULL pointer dereference** or a path **memory leak**. For example ext4_split_extent path = *ppath = 2000 ext4_find_extent if (depth > path[0].p_maxdepth) kfree(path = 2000) *orig_path = path = NULL path = kcalloc() = 3000 ext4_split_extent_at(*ppath = NULL) path = *ppath ex = path[depth].p_ext // **NULL pointer dereference**! ================================================================== BUG kernel **NULL pointer dereference**, address 0000000000000010 CPU 6 UID 0 PID 576 Comm fsstress Not tainted 6.11.0-rc2-dirty #847 RIP 0010ext4_split_extent_at+0x6d/0x560 Call Trace ext4_split_extent.isra.0+0xcb/0x1b0 ext4_ext_convert_to_initialized+0x168/0x6c0 ext4_ext_handle_unwritten_extents+0x325/0x4d0 ext4_ext_map_blocks+0x520/0xdb0 ext4_map_blocks+0x2b0/0x690 ext4_iomap_begin+0x20e/0x2c0 [...] ================================================================== Therefore, *orig_path is updated when the extent lookup succeeds, so that the caller can safely use path or *ppath.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\nThe root cause of the vulnerability lies in the `ext4_find_extent()` function within the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem implementation. This function is responsible for locating the extent of a given block within a file. When the allocated memory for the path (used in the extent lookup process) is insufficient, the code frees the existing memory and sets the `*orig_path` pointer to NULL. However, after reallocating memory and initializing the path successfully, `*orig_path` is not updated to reflect the new memory location.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n-   **Use-after-free:** While not a classic use-after-free, the vulnerability manifests similarly due to the incorrect handling of the `orig_path` pointer. The caller gets a valid path, however, the `*ppath` will remain NULL.\n-   **Null Pointer Dereference:** When `ext4_split_extent_at` is called later, it attempts to dereference the potentially NULL `*ppath`, leading to a kernel NULL pointer dereference.\n-   **Memory Leak**: In scenarios where a caller frees the path based on `*ppath` rather than the potentially valid path which is returned by the function, this can lead to memory leaks.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n-   **Kernel Crash:** Exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a kernel crash due to a NULL pointer dereference, resulting in a denial of service.\n-   **Potential memory leaks:** In certain usage cases this can lead to memory leaks.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n-   **File System Operations:** The vulnerability is triggered by operations that involve extent manipulation, such as writing to or modifying files within an ext4 filesystem.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n-   **User Privileges:** An attacker needs to be able to perform operations that trigger the vulnerable code path, such as writing to an ext4 filesystem. This could be a normal user with write access to a file or directory on an affected filesystem.\n-   **Kernel Interaction:** The attacker's action must cause the kernel to invoke the ext4 extent management code which will trigger the vulnerability when the code attempts to reallocate the path.\n\n**More Details than CVE:**\n\nThe provided content gives significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. The following information is particularly useful:\n\n-   **Specific code locations:** The patches indicate the exact files and lines of code affected.\n-   **Detailed explanation of the bug:** The commit messages explain the logic error using example and the observed kernel panic backtrace.\n-   **Call trace:** The content provides a full call trace of the kernel panic. This allows a clear understanding of the vulnerable code path.\n-   **Fixes:** The patch changes highlight the solution, i.e. updating the `*orig_path` with the new allocated memory to fix the issue.",

This relates to **access of uninitialized pointer** (CWE-824). The **NULL pointer dereference** is a consequence of failing to properly manage the path variable, which could lead to memory leaks if the resource is not properly released, connecting to improper resource shutdown or release (CWE-404).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe824[\"CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\"]\n    cwe404[\"CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release\"]\n\n    cwe476 <--|CANFOLLOW| cwe824\n    cwe404 <--|CANFOLLOW| cwe824\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe476 primary\n    class cwe824,cwe404 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a potential failure to properly initialize or reallocate memory for the `path` variable in the `ext4_find_extent` function. When reallocation fails or the path isn't updated after reallocation, the code proceeds with a **NULL** `ppath`, which subsequently leads to a **NULL pointer dereference** in `ext4_split_extent_at`. If the memory isn't freed, it results in a memory leak.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis identifies a **NULL pointer dereference** as the primary vulnerability. The evidence in the vulnerability description clearly points to a scenario where `*ppath` is **NULL** when `ext4_split_extent_at` is called, leading to the dereference. The related issues of potentially uninitialized memory and resource leaks contribute to the secondary classifications.\n\nThe primary decision is based on the explicit mention of \"NULL pointer dereference\" in the provided description. The graph relationships highlight that an **access of uninitialized pointer** can lead to a **NULL pointer dereference**.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity as they directly represent the identified weaknesses described in the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-667: Improper Locking\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-909: Missing Initialization of Resource\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize a critical resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-665: Improper Initialization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not initialize or incorrectly initializes a resource, which might leave the resource in an unexpected state when it is accessed or used.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
