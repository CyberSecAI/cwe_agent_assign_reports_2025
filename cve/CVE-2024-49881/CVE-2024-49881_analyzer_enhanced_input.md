# Vulnerability Description

    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ext4 update orig_path in ext4_find_extent() In ext4_find_extent(), if the path is not big enough, we free it and set *orig_path to NULL. But after reallocating and successfully initializing the path, we dont update *orig_path, in which case the caller gets a valid path but a NULL ppath, and this may cause a **NULL pointer dereference** or a path **memory leak**. For example ext4_split_extent path = *ppath = 2000 ext4_find_extent if (depth > path[0].p_maxdepth) kfree(path = 2000) *orig_path = path = NULL path = kcalloc() = 3000 ext4_split_extent_at(*ppath = NULL) path = *ppath ex = path[depth].p_ext // **NULL pointer dereference**! ================================================================== BUG kernel **NULL pointer dereference**, address 0000000000000010 CPU 6 UID 0 PID 576 Comm fsstress Not tainted 6.11.0-rc2-dirty #847 RIP 0010ext4_split_extent_at+0x6d/0x560 Call Trace ext4_split_extent.isra.0+0xcb/0x1b0 ext4_ext_convert_to_initialized+0x168/0x6c0 ext4_ext_handle_unwritten_extents+0x325/0x4d0 ext4_ext_map_blocks+0x520/0xdb0 ext4_map_blocks+0x2b0/0x690 ext4_iomap_begin+0x20e/0x2c0 [...] ================================================================== Therefore, *orig_path is updated when the extent lookup succeeds, so that the caller can safely use path or *ppath.
