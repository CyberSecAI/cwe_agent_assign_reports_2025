However, the key phrase \"**improper privilege management**\" and the fact that users with \"viewer roles\" can modify models owned by others suggests an **incorrect privilege assignment**, making CWE-266 the most appropriate primary CWE. The secondary CWE, CWE-863, highlights that the authorization check is present but flawed due to the incorrect privilege assignment. The evidence provided strongly supports the selection of CWE-266 as the primary cause. The relationship analysis confirms that CWE-266 is a more specific instance of the broader category of improper privilege management.\n\nThe vulnerability description states \"In lunary-ai/lunary v1.5.0, **improper privilege management** in the models.ts file allows users with viewer roles to modify models owned by others. The PATCH endpoint for models does not have appropriate privilege checks, enabling low-privilege users to update models they should not have access to modify.\" This directly indicates a problem with how privileges are assigned to users, leading to the incorrect authorization.\n\nCWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) was considered but is too high-level. The vulnerability is more specifically about the assignment of privileges (CWE-266) rather than the general management of privileges. CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) was also considered but it suggests the authorization mechanism itself is flawed, whereas here the authorization fails because of the incorrect privilege assignment. CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) was not selected as the vulnerability description says that the PATCH endpoint \"does not have appropriate privilege checks\" meaning that authorization checks are present.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1378.27\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 1336.33\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-269 is commonly misused.
