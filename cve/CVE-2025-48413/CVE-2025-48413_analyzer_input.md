# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-48413

## Vulnerability Description
The `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files reveal **hard-coded password hashes** for the operating system root user. The credentials are shipped with the update files. There is no option for deleting or changing their passwords for an enduser. An attacker can use the credentials to log into the device. Authentication can be performed via SSH backdoor or likely via physical access (UART shell).

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow
- **rootcause:** **hard-coded password hashes**
- **impact:** log into the device
- **attacker:** attacker

## Analysis of CVE-2025-48413 based on provided content:

The content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2025-48413. Here's the extracted information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-48413

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files reveal hard-coded password hashes for the "root" user. These credentials are shipped with the update files, and there is no option for end-users to delete or change them.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Hard-coded credentials for the root user.
*   Lack of password change functionality for the root user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can use the credentials to log into the device. Authentication can be performed via the SSH backdoor or likely via physical access (UART shell).

**Attack vectors:**
*   Exploitation of hardcoded credentials via SSH.
*   Physical access to the device (UART shell).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Access to the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files (potentially through firmware analysis or physical access).
*   Knowledge of how to exploit the root credentials.

**Mitigation or fix:**
The vendor has not provided a fix for this vulnerability as of the publication of the advisory. The recommended workaround is to isolate the devices.

**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**
*   The vulnerability exists in eCharge Hardy Barth cPH2 and cPP2 charging stations, version 2.2.0.
*   The advisory details a series of other vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-27803, CVE-2025-27804, CVE-2025-48414, CVE-2025-48415, CVE-2025-48416, CVE-2025-48417) affecting the same product.
*   The vendor was notified of the vulnerabilities 160 days prior to public disclosure but did not provide fixes.
*   The advisory recommends charge point operators (CPOs) to take active measures to minimize risk, including physical security, video surveillance, network segmentation, firewalling, and disabling remote access.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”

| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| No identity check (no login)                               | CWE-306        |
| No role/privilege check after login                        | CWE-862        |
| Role check is present but flawed                           | CWE-863        |
| General or ambiguous authorization failure                 | CWE-285        |
| High-level access control problem with no clear root cause | CWE-284        |
