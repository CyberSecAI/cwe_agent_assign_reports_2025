Here's the extracted information:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-48413\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files reveal hard-coded password hashes for the \"root\" user. These credentials are shipped with the update files, and there is no option for end-users to delete or change them.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n*   Hard-coded credentials for the root user.\n*   Lack of password change functionality for the root user.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nAn attacker can use the credentials to log into the device. Authentication can be performed via the SSH backdoor or likely via physical access (UART shell).\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n*   Exploitation of hardcoded credentials via SSH.\n*   Physical access to the device (UART shell).\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n*   Access to the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files (potentially through firmware analysis or physical access).\n*   Knowledge of how to exploit the root credentials.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\nThe vendor has not provided a fix for this vulnerability as of the publication of the advisory. The recommended workaround is to isolate the devices.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n*   The vulnerability exists in eCharge Hardy Barth cPH2 and cPP2 charging stations, version 2.2.0.\n*   The advisory details a series of other vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-27803, CVE-2025-27804, CVE-2025-48414, CVE-2025-48415, CVE-2025-48416, CVE-2025-48417) affecting the same product.\n*   The vendor was notified of the vulnerabilities 160 days prior to public disclosure but did not provide fixes.\n*   The advisory recommends charge point operators (CPOs) to take active measures to minimize risk, including physical security, video surveillance, network segmentation, firewalling, and disabling remote access.",

CWE-259, a variant of CWE-798, specifies that the hard-coded credential is a password. This relationship influenced the decision to include CWE-259 as a secondary CWE to provide more specificity. Also, the device can be logged into using these credentials, thus making it a Missing Authentication for Critical Function, CWE-306.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe259[\"CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    \n    cwe259 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n    cwe306 -->|RELATED| cwe798\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe798 primary\n    class cwe259,cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **root cause**: the presence of **hard-coded password hashes** in `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files (CWE-798). An attacker exploits this by using these credentials to log into the device, potentially through an SSH backdoor or physical access (UART shell), leading to a **missing authentication** issue (CWE-306).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on strong evidence from the vulnerability description and CVE reference. The **root cause** is clearly identified as the use of **hard-coded password hashes** for the root user (CWE-798). The use of CWE-259 is justified because the hard-coded credential is specifically a password, making it a more specific variant of CWE-798. The presence of these **hard-coded password hashes** allows the attacker to log into the system, thus missing authentication, CWE-306.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity.
