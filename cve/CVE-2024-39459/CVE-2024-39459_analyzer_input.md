# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-39459

## Vulnerability Description
In rare cases Jenkins Plain Credentials Plugin 182.v468b_97b_9dcb_8 and earlier **stores secret file credentials unencrypted** (only Base64 encoded) on the Jenkins controller file system, where they can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system (global credentials) or with Item/Extended Read permission (folder-scoped credentials).

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stores secret file credentials unencrypted**
- **impact:** view credentials
- **attacker:** users with access to Jenkins controller file system
- **product:** Jenkins Plain Credentials Plugin
- **version:** 182.v468b_97b_9dcb_8 and earlier

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-39459:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Plain Credentials Plugin, in versions 182.v468b_97b_9dcb_8 and earlier, attempts to decrypt the content of a file when creating secret file credentials to verify if it's a valid encrypted secret.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Handling of Encrypted Data:** The plugin's attempt to decrypt the file content to validate it could lead to a scenario where a file that *happens* to match the expected format of an encrypted secret is then stored as an unencrypted, albeit Base64-encoded, file on the Jenkins controller file system. This essentially bypasses the intended encryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Exposure of Sensitive Information:**  The primary impact is the exposure of sensitive information contained within secret file credentials. While the stored credential files are Base64 encoded, this is easily reversible, revealing the actual secrets.
- **Unauthorized Access:** These unencrypted credentials could be viewed by:
    - Users with direct access to the Jenkins controller file system (for global credentials).
    - Users with "Item/Extended Read" permissions (for folder-scoped credentials).

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious File Upload:** An attacker could upload a specially crafted file designed to mimic the encrypted secret format to trigger the vulnerability and cause it to be stored unencrypted.
- **Access to File System:** An attacker already having access to the Jenkins controller file system can directly read the stored, unencrypted, credentials.
- **Abuse of Permissions:** An attacker who has "Item/Extended Read" permissions can read folder-scoped unencrypted credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-  **User Interaction (Limited):** An attacker needs to somehow cause the upload of a specially crafted secret file through the Jenkins UI (or potentially, a malicious API call, if applicable).
- **Access to the Jenkins Controller File System:** For global credentials, the attacker requires access to the Jenkins server's file system.
-  **Sufficient Permissions:** For folder-scoped credentials, the attacker needs "Item/Extended Read" permissions within Jenkins.
    
**Additional Notes:**
- **Unusable Credentials:** The advisory notes that the unencrypted credentials stored due to this vulnerability are unusable by Jenkins in their unencrypted form. They would still be decrypted when in use, therefore, the existing, correctly configured credentials are not impacted.
- **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is addressed in version 183.va_de8f1dd5a_2b_ of the Plain Credentials Plugin, which no longer attempts decryption during credential creation.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

| “Unauthorized read/write to file”           | Permission control issue              | CWE-285                                      |
| “Can access resource without correct role”  | Incorrect or missing permission check | CWE-285, 862, 863                            |

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
