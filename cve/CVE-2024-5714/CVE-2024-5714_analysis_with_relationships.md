# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |

| CWE-863 | Incorrect Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-266 | Incorrect Privilege Assignment | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-863, which is a Class-level weakness describing that the product performs an authorization check, but it does not correctly perform the check. CWE-863 has child relationships to CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) and CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment). The **misconfiguration** of the `org_id` attribute to `orgId` can be seen as an instance of **incorrect privilege assignment**, making it a secondary weakness contributing to the overall vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **misconfiguration** in attribute naming (`org_id` should be `orgId`) leading to the backend's failure to validate project identifiers. This leads to **improper access control**, allowing attackers to **manipulate project identifiers** in requests, ultimately resulting in **privilege escalation**.

## Summary of Analysis
The primary weakness is **improper access control** due to the backend's failure to validate project identifiers, which is caused by a **misconfiguration** of the attribute name, allowing members with team management permissions to manipulate project identifiers, resulting in privilege escalation.

CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) best captures the essence of the vulnerability because the system is performing an authorization check, but it is not correctly performed due to the attribute misconfiguration and lack of validation. The child CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) accounts for the **misconfiguration** aspect of the vulnerability where the backend assigns incorrect privileges because of the incorrect attribute name.

CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) were considered but not chosen. CWE-285 is a high-level Class, and CWE-863 is more specific. CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) does not apply because the system *is* performing authorization checks, albeit incorrectly.

The chosen CWEs are at an optimal level of specificity, providing a clear and accurate representation of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.68
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
During installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 2860.90
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-285: Improper Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 2834.01
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-285 is high-level and lower-level CWEs can frequently be used instead. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).



## CWE-862: Missing Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 2753.
