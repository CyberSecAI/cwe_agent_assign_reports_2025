  "description": "In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.4, an **improper access control** vulnerability allows members with team management permissions to manipulate project identifiers in requests, enabling them to invite users to projects in other organizations, change members to projects in other organizations with escalated privileges, and change members from other organizations to their own or other projects, also with escalated privileges. This vulnerability is due to the backends failure to validate project identifiers against the current users organization ID and projects belonging to it, as well as a **misconfiguration** in attribute naming (`org_id` should be `orgId`) that prevents proper user organization validation. As a result, attackers can cause inconsistencies on the platform for affected users and organizations, including unauthorized privilege escalation. The issue is present in the backend API endpoints for user invitation and modification, specifically in the handling of project IDs in requests.",

CWE-863 has child relationships to CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key) and CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment). The **misconfiguration** of the `org_id` attribute to `orgId` can be seen as an instance of **incorrect privilege assignment**, making it a secondary weakness contributing to the overall vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n\n    cwe266 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n    cwe639 -->|CHILDOF| cwe863\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe266 secondary\n    class cwe639 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **misconfiguration** in attribute naming (`org_id` should be `orgId`) leading to the backend's failure to validate project identifiers. This leads to **improper access control**, allowing attackers to **manipulate project identifiers** in requests, ultimately resulting in **privilege escalation**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **improper access control** due to the backend's failure to validate project identifiers, which is caused by a **misconfiguration** of the attribute name, allowing members with team management permissions to manipulate project identifiers, resulting in privilege escalation.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) best captures the essence of the vulnerability because the system is performing an authorization check, but it is not correctly performed due to the attribute misconfiguration and lack of validation. The child CWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) accounts for the **misconfiguration** aspect of the vulnerability where the backend assigns incorrect privileges because of the incorrect attribute name.\n\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) were considered but not chosen. CWE-285 is a high-level Class, and CWE-863 is more specific. CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) does not apply because the system *is* performing authorization checks, albeit incorrectly.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at an optimal level of specificity, providing a clear and accurate representation of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n##
