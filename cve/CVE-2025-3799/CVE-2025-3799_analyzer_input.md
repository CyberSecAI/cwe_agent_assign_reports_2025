## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, was found in WCMS 11. Affected is an unknown function of the file app/controllers/AnonymousController.php. The manipulation of the argument email/username leads to **sql injection**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Other parameters might be affected as well.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** WCMS
- **version:** 11
- **component:** app/controllers/AnonymousController.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The `email` and `username` parameters in the `anonymous/setregister` interface of WCMS11 are vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient filtering and the direct concatenation of user-supplied parameters into SQL queries.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- SQL Injection vulnerability in the `email` and `username` parameters.

Impact of exploitation:
- Website intrusion
- Data theft

Attack vectors:
- Attackers can construct special SQL statements to inject malicious code through the `email` and `username` parameters in the `anonymous/setregister` interface.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- An attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the `anonymous/setregister` interface with crafted `email` and `username` parameters.

Mitigation or fix:
- Thoroughly filter the values of the `email` and `username` parameters.
- Use prepared statements for backend SQL queries to avoid directly concatenating parameters into SQL statements.
