Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\\n\\n\\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\\n\\n\\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\\n\\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\\n\\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.', 'alternate_terms': ['Shell injection', 'Shell metacharacters', 'OS Command Injection'], 'original_content': 'The product constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.', 'relationships': [{'source_id': '78', 'target_id': '184', 'label': 'CANFOLLOW', 'properties': {'view_id': '1000'}}, {'source_id': '78', 'target_id': '88', 'label': 'CANALSOBE', 'properties': {'view_id': '1000'}}, {'source_id': '78', 'target_id': '77', 'label': 'CHILDOF', 'properties': {'ordinal': 'Primary', 'view_id': '1340'}}, {'source_id': '78', 'target_id': '77', 'label': 'CHILDOF', 'properties': {'ordinal': 'Primary', 'view_id': '1305'}}, {'source_id': '78', 'target_id': '74', 'label': 'CHILDOF', 'properties': {'ordinal': 'Primary', 'view_id': '1003'}}, {'source_id': '78', 'target_id': '77', 'label': 'CHILDOF', 'properties': {'ordinal': 'Primary', 'view_id': '1000'}}, {'source_id': '77', 'target_id': '78', 'label': 'PARENTOF', 'properties': {'ordinal': 'Primary', 'view_id': '1000'}}, {'source_id': '74', 'target_id': '78', 'label': 'PARENTOF', 'properties': {'ordinal': 'Primary', 'view_id': '1003'}}, {'source_id': '184', 'target_id': '78', 'label': 'CANPRECEDE', 'properties': {'view_id': '1000'}}], 'source': 'graph', 'sources': ['vector', 'graph'], 'vector_score': 0.6197788933186711, 'graph_score': 3.4866, 'score_components': {'relationship_chain': 0.6, 'explicit_mention': 1.0, 'abstraction_path': 0.9, 'sequence_path': 0.6400000000000001}, 'abstraction_factor': 1.3, 'graph_path_info': {'path_types': ['relationship_chain', 'vulnerability_sequence_forward'], 'best_paths': {'relationship_chain': {'path': [('73', '434', 'CANPRECEDE'), ('434', '184', 'CANFOLLOW'), ('184', '78', 'CANPRECEDE')], 'score': 0.6, 'type': 'relationship_chain', 'source': '73'}, 'vulnerability_sequence_forward': {'path': [('73', '434', 'CANPRECEDE'), ('434', '184', 'CANFOLLOW'), ('184', '78', 'CANPRECEDE')], 'score': 0.6400000000000001, 'type': 'vulnerability_sequence_forward', 'source': '73'}}}, 'is_explicit': True, 'abstraction_level': 'base', 'position': 'after', 'mapping_notes': {'usage': 'Allowed', 'rationale': 'This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.', 'comments': \"Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit.

An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.\n\t\t2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.\n```\nFor example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-45918: Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n\n- CVE-2008-5748: Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.\n\n- CVE-2008-5764: Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-19155: Improper Access Control in Jfinal CMS v4.7.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information and/or execute arbitrary code via the 'FileManager.rename()' function in the component 'modules/filemanager/FileManagerController.java'.\n\n- CVE-2021-40639: Improper access control in Jfinal CMS 5.1.0 allows attackers to access sensitive information via /classes/conf/db.properties&config=filemanager.config.js.\n\n- CVE-2021-27236: An issue was discovered in Mutare Voice (EVM) 3.x before 3.3.8. getfile.asp allows Unauthenticated Local File Inclusion, which can be leveraged to achieve Remote Code Execution.\n\n- CVE-2021-22539: An attacker can place a crafted JSON config file into the project folder pointing to a custom executable. VScode-bazel allows the workspace path to lint *.bzl files to be set via this config file. As such the attacker is able to execute any executable on the system through vscode-bazel. We recommend upgrading to version 0.4.1 or above.\n\n- CVE-2021-22009: The vCenter Server contains multiple denial-of-service vulnerabilities in VAPI (vCenter API) service. A malicious actor with network access to port 443 on vCenter Server may exploit these issues to create a denial of service condition due to excessive memory consumption by VAPI service.\n\n- CVE-2021-34539: An issue was discovered in CubeCoders AMP before 2.1.1.8. A lack of validation of the Java Version setting means that an unintended executable path can be set. The result is that high-privileged users can trigger code execution.\n\n- CVE-2021-43893: Windows Encrypting File System (EFS) Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-43066: A external control of file name or path in Fortinet FortiClientWindows version 7.0.2 and below, version 6.4.6 and below, version 6.2.9 and below, version 6.0.10 and below allows attacker to escalate privilege via the MSI installer.\n\n- CVE-2022-24900: Piano LED Visualizer is software that allows LED lights to light up as a person plays a piano connected to a computer. Version 1.3 and prior are vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The `os.path.join` call is unsafe for use with untrusted input. When the `os.path.join` call encounters an absolute path, it ignores all the parameters it has encountered till that point and starts working with the new absolute path. Since the \"malicious\" parameter represents an absolute path, the result of `os.path.join` ignores the static directory completely. Hence, untrusted input is passed via the `os.path.join` call to `flask.send_file` can lead to path traversal attacks. A patch with a fix is available on the `master` branch of the GitHub repository. This can also be fixed by preventing flow of untrusted data to the vulnerable `send_file` function. In case the application logic necessiates this behaviour, one can either use the `flask.safe_join` to join untrusted paths or replace `flask.send_file` calls with `flask.send_from_directory` calls.\n\n- CVE-2022-34765: A CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path vulnerability exists that could cause loading of unauthorized firmware images when user-controlled data is written to the file path. Affected Products: X80 advanced RTU Communication Module (BMENOR2200H) (V2.01 and later), OPC UA Modicon Communication Module (BMENUA0100) (V1.10 and prior)\n\n- CVE-2022-39952: A external control of file name or path in Fortinet FortiNAC versions 9.4.0, 9.2.0 through 9.2.5, 9.1.0 through 9.1.7, 8.8.0 through 8.8.11, 8.7.0 through 8.7.6, 8.6.0 through 8.6.5, 8.5.0 through 8.5.4, 8.3.7 may allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands via specifically crafted HTTP request.\n\n- CVE-2022-45918: ILIAS before 7.16 allows External Control of File Name or Path.\n\n- CVE-2022-23118: Jenkins Debian Package Builder Plugin 1.6.11 and earlier implements functionality that allows agents to invoke command-line `git` at an attacker-specified path on the controller, allowing attackers able to control agent processes to invoke arbitrary OS commands on the controller.\n\n- CVE-2022-25643: seatd-launch in seatd 0.6.x before 0.6.4 allows removing files with escalated privileges when installed setuid root. The attack vector is a user-supplied socket pathname.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-642 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-610 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-22 (CanPrecede)\n\n- CWE-41 (CanPrecede)\n\n- CWE-98 (CanPrecede)\n\n- CWE-434 (CanPrecede)\n\n- CWE-59 (CanPrecede)",

NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-11736.\n\n- CVE-2021-21272: ORAS is open source software which enables a way to push OCI Artifacts to OCI Conformant registries. ORAS is both a CLI for initial testing and a Go Module. In ORAS from version 0.4.0 and before version 0.9.0, there is a \"zip-slip\" vulnerability. The directory support feature allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links and hard links. A well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who runs `oras pull`. Users of the affected versions are impacted if they are `oras` CLI users who runs `oras pull`, or if they are Go programs, which invoke `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`. The problem has been fixed in version 0.9.0. For `oras` CLI users, there is no workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider. For `oras` package users, the workaround is to not use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`, and use other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider.\n\n- CVE-2021-28650: autoar-extractor.c in GNOME gnome-autoar before 0.3.1, as used by GNOME Shell, Nautilus, and other software, allows Directory Traversal during extraction because it lacks a check of whether a file's parent is a symlink in certain complex situations. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-36241.\n\n- CVE-2021-32518: A vulnerability in share_link in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote attackers to create a symbolic link then access arbitrary files. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32803: The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.4.15, and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via insufficient symlink protection. `node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-32825: bblfshd is an open source self-hosted server for source code parsing. In bblfshd before commit 4265465b9b6fb5663c30ee43806126012066aad4 there is a \"zipslip\" vulnerability. The unsafe handling of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may enable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations outside the designated target folder. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive file. Additionally, if the attacker has read access to the unpacked files, he may be able to read arbitrary system files the parent process has permissions to read. For more details including a PoC see the referenced GHSL-2020-258.\n\n- CVE-2021-36286: Dell SupportAssist Client Consumer versions 3.9.13.0 and any versions prior to 3.9.13.0 contain an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability that can be exploited by using the Windows feature of NTFS called Symbolic links. Symbolic links can be created by any(non-privileged) user under some object directories, but by themselves are not sufficient to successfully escalate privileges. However, combining them with a different object, such as the NTFS junction point allows for the exploitation. Support assist clean files functionality do not distinguish junction points from the physical folder and proceeds to clean the target of the junction that allows nonprivileged users to create junction points and delete arbitrary files on the system which can be accessed only by the admin.\n\n- CVE-2021-38511: An issue was discovered in the tar crate before 0.4.36 for Rust.

The vulnerability is limited to the command `oc image extract`. If a symbolic link is first created pointing within the tarball, this allows further symbolic links to bypass the existing path check. This flaw allows the tarball to create links outside the tarball's parent directory, allowing for executables or configuration files to be overwritten, resulting in arbitrary code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. Versions up to and including openshift-clients-4.7.0-202104250659.p0.git.95881af are affected.\n\n- CVE-2020-27697: Trend Micro Security 2020 (Consumer) contains a vulnerability in the installer package that could be exploited by placing a malicious DLL in a non-protected location with high privileges (symlink attack) which can lead to obtaining administrative privileges during the installation of the product.\n\n- CVE-2020-4717: A vulnerability exists in IBM SPSS Modeler Subscription Installer that allows a user with create symbolic link permission to write arbitrary file in another protected path during product installation.

It affects multi-user setups in which \u2019guix-daemon\u2019 runs locally. The attack consists in having an unprivileged user spawn a build process, for instance with `guix build`, that makes its build directory world-writable. The user then creates a hardlink to a root-owned file such as /etc/shadow in that build directory. If the user passed the --keep-failed option and the build eventually fails, the daemon changes ownership of the whole build tree, including the hardlink, to the user. At that point, the user has write access to the target file. Versions after and including v0.11.0-3298-g2608e40988, and versions prior to v1.2.0-75109-g94f0312546 are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2020-28007: Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Execution with Unnecessary Privileges.

These exposures can be inadvertent (bug) or intentional (design).\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2002-2094: This, and others, use \"..\" attacks and monitor error responses, so there is overlap with directory traversal.\n\n- CVE-2001-1483: Enumeration of valid usernames based on inconsistent responses\n\n- CVE-2001-1528: Account number enumeration via inconsistent responses.\n\n- CVE-2004-2150: User enumeration via discrepancies in error messages.\n\n- CVE-2005-1650: User enumeration via discrepancies in error messages.\n\n- CVE-2004-0294: Bulletin Board displays different error messages when a user exists or not, which makes it easier for remote attackers to identify valid users and conduct a brute force password guessing attack.\n\n- CVE-2004-0243: Operating System, when direct remote login is disabled, displays a different message if the password is correct, which allows remote attackers to guess the password via brute force methods.\n\n- CVE-2002-0514: Product allows remote attackers to determine if a port is being filtered because the response packet TTL is different than the default TTL.\n\n- CVE-2002-0515: Product sets a different TTL when a port is being filtered than when it is not being filtered, which allows remote attackers to identify filtered ports by comparing TTLs.\n\n- CVE-2001-1387: Product may generate different responses than specified by the administrator, possibly leading to an information leak.\n\n- CVE-2004-0778: Version control system allows remote attackers to determine the existence of arbitrary files and directories via the -X command for an alternate history file, which causes different error messages to be returned.\n\n- CVE-2004-1428: FTP server generates an error message if the user name does not exist instead of prompting for a password, which allows remote attackers to determine valid usernames.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0086: Observable response discrepancy in floating-point operations for some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-0089: Observable response discrepancy in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-20376: IBM Sterling File Gateway 2.2.0.0 through 6.1.1.0 could allow an authenticated attacker to enumerate usernames due to there being an observable discrepancy in returned messages. IBM X-Force ID: 195568.\n\n- CVE-2021-37151: CyberArk Identity 21.5.131, when handling an invalid authentication attempt, sometimes reveals whether the username is valid. In certain authentication policy configurations with MFA, the API response length can be used to differentiate between a valid user and an invalid one (aka Username Enumeration). Response differentiation enables attackers to enumerate usernames of valid application users. Attackers can use this information to leverage brute-force and dictionary attacks in order to discover valid account information such as passwords.\n\n- CVE-2021-37968: Inappropriate implementation in Background Fetch API in Google Chrome prior to 94.0.4606.54 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2020-35518: When binding against a DN during authentication, the reply from 389-ds-base will be different whether the DN exists or not. This can be used by an unauthenticated attacker to check the existence of an entry in the LDAP database.\n\n- CVE-2021-27583: In Directus 8.x through 8.8.1, an attacker can discover whether a user is present in the database through the password reset feature. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer\n\n- CVE-2021-22892: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Rocket.Chat server fixed v3.13, v3.12.2 & v3.11.3 that allowed email addresses to be disclosed by enumeration and validation checks.\n\n- CVE-2021-44848: In Cibele Thinfinity VirtualUI before 3.0, /changePassword returns different responses for invalid authentication requests depending on whether the username exists.\n\n- CVE-2021-20049: A vulnerability in SonicWall SMA100 password change API allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to perform SMA100 username enumeration based on the server responses. This vulnerability impacts 10.2.1.2-24sv, 10.2.0.8-37sv and earlier 10.x versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-24784: Statamic is a Laravel and Git powered CMS. Before versions 3.2.39 and 3.3.2, it is possible to confirm a single character of a user's password hash using a specially crafted regular expression filter in the users endpoint of the REST API. Multiple such requests can eventually uncover the entire hash. The hash is not present in the response, however the presence or absence of a result confirms if the character is in the right position. The API has throttling enabled by default, making this a time intensive task. Both the REST API and the users endpoint need to be enabled, as they are disabled by default. The issue has been fixed in versions 3.2.39 and above, and 3.3.2 and above.\n\n- CVE-2021-20147: ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus below build 6116 contains an observable response discrepancy in the UMCP operation of the ChangePasswordAPI. This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to determine whether a Windows domain user exists.\n\n- CVE-2021-38009: Inappropriate implementation in cache in Google Chrome prior to 96.0.4664.45 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-1139: Inappropriate implementation in Background Fetch API in Google Chrome prior to 100.0.4896.60 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-27814: SWHKD 1.1.5 allows arbitrary file-existence tests via the -c option.\n\n- CVE-2022-47952: lxc-user-nic in lxc through 5.0.1 is installed setuid root, and may allow local users to infer whether any file exists, even within a protected directory tree, because \"Failed to open\" often indicates that a file does not exist, whereas \"does not refer to a network namespace path\" often indicates that a file exists. NOTE: this is different from CVE-2018-6556 because the CVE-2018-6556 fix design was based on the premise that \"we will report back to the user that the open() failed but the user has no way of knowing why it failed\"; however, in many realistic cases, there are no plausible reasons for failing except that the file does not exist.\n\n- CVE-2022-24032: Adenza AxiomSL ControllerView through 10.8.1 is vulnerable to user enumeration. An attacker can identify valid usernames on the platform because a failed login attempt produces a different error message when the username is valid.\n\n- CVE-2022-0569: Observable Discrepancy in Packagist snipe/snipe-it prior to v5.3.9. \n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-203 (ChildOf)",

In some cases, it is useful for bypassing protection schemes in environments for which \"/\" is supported but not the primary separator, such as Windows, which uses \"\\\" but can also accept \"/\".\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-45918: Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-47945: ThinkPHP Framework before 6.0.14 allows local file inclusion via the lang parameter when the language pack feature is enabled (lang_switch_on=true). An unauthenticated and remote attacker can exploit this to execute arbitrary operating system commands, as demonstrated by including pearcmd.php.\n\n- CVE-2022-2945: The WordPress Infinite Scroll \u2013 Ajax Load More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in versions up to, and including, 5.5.3 via the 'type' parameter found in the alm_get_layout() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrative permissions, to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2022-36065: GrowthBook is an open-source platform for feature flagging and A/B testing. With some self-hosted configurations in versions prior to 2022-08-29, attackers can register new accounts and upload files to arbitrary directories within the container. If the attacker uploads a Python script to the right location, they can execute arbitrary code within the container. To be affected, ALL of the following must be true: Self-hosted deployment (GrowthBook Cloud is unaffected); using local file uploads (as opposed to S3 or Google Cloud Storage); NODE_ENV set to a non-production value and JWT_SECRET set to an easily guessable string like `dev`. This issue is patched in commit 1a5edff8786d141161bf880c2fd9ccbe2850a264 (2022-08-29). As a workaround, set `JWT_SECRET` environment variable to a long random string. This will stop arbitrary file uploads, but the only way to stop attackers from registering accounts is by updating to the latest build.\n\n- CVE-2022-3060: Improper control of a resource identifier in Error Tracking in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 12.7 allows an authenticated attacker to generate content which could cause a victim to make unintended arbitrary requests\n\n- CVE-2022-32409: A local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in the component codemirror.php of Portal do Software Publico Brasileiro i3geo v7.0.5 allows attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a crafted HTTP request.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-23 (ChildOf)",

These functions are normally exposed over the network and once exploited the attacker may be able to view and modify financial accounting data that only a specific user should have access to.\n\n- CVE-2021-38431: An authenticated user using Advantech WebAccess SCADA in versions 9.0.3 and prior can use API functions to disclose project names and paths from other users.\n\n- CVE-2021-38755: Unauthenticated doctor entry deletion in Hospital Management System in admin-panel1.php.\n\n- CVE-2021-39347: The Stripe for WooCommerce WordPress plugin is missing a capability check on the save() function found in the ~/includes/admin/class-wc-stripe-admin-user-edit.php file that makes it possible for attackers to configure their account to use other site users unique STRIPE identifier and make purchases with their payment accounts. This affects versions 3.0.0 - 3.3.9.\n\n- CVE-2021-40088: An issue was discovered in PrimeKey EJBCA before 7.6.0. CMP RA Mode can be configured to use a known client certificate to authenticate enrolling clients. The same RA client certificate is used for revocation requests as well. While enrollment enforces multi tenancy constraints (by verifying that the client certificate has access to the CA and Profiles being enrolled against), this check was not performed when authenticating revocation operations, allowing a known tenant to revoke a certificate belonging to another tenant.\n\n- CVE-2021-40501: SAP ABAP Platform Kernel - versions 7.77, 7.81, 7.85, 7.86, does not perform necessary authorization checks for an authenticated business user, resulting in escalation of privileges. That means this business user is able to read and modify data beyond the vulnerable system. However, the attacker can neither significantly reduce the performance of the system nor stop the system.\n\n- CVE-2021-40502: SAP Commerce - versions 2105.3, 2011.13, 2005.18, 1905.34, does not perform necessary authorization checks for an authenticated user, resulting in escalation of privileges. Authenticated attackers will be able to access and edit data from b2b units they do not belong to.\n\n- CVE-2021-41238: Hangfire is an open source system to perform background job processing in a .NET or .NET Core applications. No Windows Service or separate process required. Dashboard UI in Hangfire.Core uses authorization filters to protect it from showing sensitive data to unauthorized users. By default when no custom authorization filters specified, `LocalRequestsOnlyAuthorizationFilter` filter is being used to allow only local requests and prohibit all the remote requests to provide sensible, protected by default settings. However due to the recent changes, in version 1.7.25 no authorization filters are used by default, allowing remote requests to succeed. If you are using `UseHangfireDashboard` method with default `DashboardOptions.Authorization` property value, then your installation is impacted. If any other authorization filter is specified in the `DashboardOptions.Authorization` property, the you are not impacted. Patched versions (1.7.26) are available both on Nuget.org and as a tagged release on the github repo. Default authorization rules now prohibit remote requests by default again by including the `LocalRequestsOnlyAuthorizationFilter` filter to the default settings. Please upgrade to the newest version in order to mitigate the issue. For users who are unable to upgrade it is possible to mitigate the issue by using the `LocalRequestsOnlyAuthorizationFilter` explicitly when configuring the Dashboard UI.\n\n- CVE-2021-42062: SAP ERP HCM Portugal does not perform necessary authorization checks for a report that reads the payroll data of employees in a certain area. Since the affected report only reads the payroll information, the attacker can neither modify any information nor cause availability impacts.\n\n- CVE-2021-42359: WP DSGVO Tools (GDPR) <= 3.1.23 had an AJAX action, \u2018admin-dismiss-unsubscribe\u2018, which lacked a capability check and a nonce check and was available to unauthenticated users, and did not check the post type when deleting unsubscription requests. As such, it was possible for an attacker to permanently delete an arbitrary post or page on the site by sending an AJAX request with the \u201caction\u201d parameter set to \u201cadmin-dismiss-unsubscribe\u201d and the \u201cid\u201d parameter set to the post to be deleted. Sending such a request would move the post to the trash, and repeating the request would permanently delete the post in question.\n\n- CVE-2021-1143: A vulnerability in Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) API authorizations could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to enumerate what users exist on the system. The vulnerability is due to a lack of authorization checks for certain API GET requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific API GET requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to enumerate users of the CMX system.\n\n- CVE-2021-20283: The web service responsible for fetching other users' enrolled courses did not validate that the requesting user had permission to view that information in each course in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2021-21481: The MigrationService, which is part of SAP NetWeaver versions 7.10, 7.11, 7.20, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50, does not perform an authorization check. This might allow an unauthorized attacker to access configuration objects, including such that grant administrative privileges. This could result in complete compromise of system confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-27509: In Visualware MyConnection Server before 11.0b build 5382, each published report is not associated with its own access code.\n\n- CVE-2021-34647: The Ninja Forms WordPress plugin is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure via the bulk_export_submissions function found in the ~/includes/Routes/Submissions.php file, in versions up to and including 3.5.7. This allows authenticated attackers to export all Ninja Forms submissions data via the /ninja-forms-submissions/export REST API which can include personally identifiable information.\n\n- CVE-2021-34648: The Ninja Forms WordPress plugin is vulnerable to arbitrary email sending via the trigger_email_action function found in the ~/includes/Routes/Submissions.php file, in versions up to and including 3.5.7. This allows authenticated attackers to send arbitrary emails from the affected server via the /ninja-forms-submissions/email-action REST API which can be used to socially engineer victims.\n\n- CVE-2021-36909: Authenticated Database Reset vulnerability in WordPress WP Reset PRO Premium plugin (versions <= 5.98) allows any authenticated user to wipe the entire database regardless of their authorization. It leads to a complete website reset and takeover.\n\n- CVE-2021-38698: HashiCorp Consul and Consul Enterprise 1.10.1 Txn.Apply endpoint allowed services to register proxies for other services, enabling access to service traffic. Fixed in 1.8.15, 1.9.9 and 1.10.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-39232: In Apache Ozone versions prior to 1.2.0, certain admin related SCM commands can be executed by any authenticated users, not just by admins.\n\n- CVE-2021-40884: Projectsend version r1295 is affected by sensitive information disclosure. Because of not checking authorization in ids parameter in files-edit.php and id parameter in process.php function, a user with uploader role can download and edit all files of users in application.\n\n- CVE-2021-41554: ARCHIBUS Web Central 21.3.3.815 (a version from 2014) does not properly validate requests for access to data and functionality in these affected endpoints: /archibus/schema/ab-edit-users.axvw, /archibus/schema/ab-data-dictionary-table.axvw, /archibus/schema/ab-schema-add-field.axvw, /archibus/schema/ab-core/views/process-navigator/ab-my-user-profile.axvw. By not verifying the permissions for access to resources, it allows a potential attacker to view pages that are not allowed. Specifically, it was found that any authenticated user can reach the administrative console for user management by directly requesting access to the page via URL. This allows a malicious user to modify all users' profiles, to elevate any privileges to administrative ones, or to create or delete any type of user. It is also possible to modify the emails of other users, through a misconfiguration of the username parameter, on the user profile page. This is fixed in all recent versions, such as version 26. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. Version 21.3 was officially de-supported by the end of 2020\n\n- CVE-2021-1506: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or gain access to sensitive information, or allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain escalated privileges or gain unauthorized access to the application.

Refer to the referenced GitHub Security Advisory for complete details. This is fixed in version 0.7.5.\n\n- CVE-2021-32748: Nextcloud Richdocuments in an open source self hosted online office. Nextcloud uses the WOPI (\"Web Application Open Platform Interface\") protocol to communicate with the Collabora Editor, the communication between these two services was not protected by a credentials or IP check. Whilst this does not result in gaining access to data that the user has not yet access to, it can result in a bypass of any enforced watermark on documents as described on the [Nextcloud Virtual Data Room](https://nextcloud.com/virtual-data-room/) website and [our documentation](https://portal.nextcloud.com/article/nextcloud-and-virtual-data-room-configuration-59.html). The Nextcloud Richdocuments releases 3.8.3 and 4.2.0 add an additional admin settings for an allowlist of IP addresses that can access the WOPI API. We recommend upgrading and configuring the allowlist to a list of Collabora servers. There is no known workaround. Note that this primarily results a bypass of any configured watermark or download protection using File Access Control. If you do not require or rely on these as a security feature no immediate action is required on your end.\n\n- CVE-2021-3653: A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the \"int_ctl\" field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.14-rc7.\n\n- CVE-2021-25409: Improper access in Notification setting prior to SMR JUN-2021 Release 1 allows physically proximate attackers to set arbitrary notification via physically configuring device.\n\n- CVE-2021-24851: The Insert Pages WordPress plugin before 3.7.0 allows users with a role as low as Contributor to access content and metadata from arbitrary posts/pages regardless of their author and status (ie private), using a shortcode. Password protected posts/pages are not affected by such issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-21984: VMware vRealize Business for Cloud 7.x prior to 7.6.0 contains a remote code execution vulnerability due to an unauthorised end point. A malicious actor with network access may exploit this issue causing unauthorised remote code execution on vRealize Business for Cloud Virtual Appliance.\n\n- CVE-2021-27903: An issue was discovered in Craft CMS before 3.6.7. In some circumstances, a potential Remote Code Execution vulnerability existed on sites that did not restrict administrative changes (if an attacker were somehow able to hijack an administrator's session).\n\n- CVE-2021-35413: A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in course_intro_pdf_import.php of Chamilo LMS v1.11.x allows authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted .htaccess file.\n\n- CVE-2021-21382: Restund is an open source NAT traversal server. The restund TURN server can be instructed to open a relay to the loopback address range. This allows you to reach any other service running on localhost which you might consider private. In the configuration that we ship (https://github.com/wireapp/ansible-restund/blob/master/templates/restund.conf.j2#L40-L43) the `status` interface of restund is enabled and is listening on `127.0.0.1`.The `status` interface allows users to issue administrative commands to `restund` like listing open relays or draining connections. It would be possible for an attacker to contact the status interface and issue administrative commands by setting `XOR-PEER-ADDRESS` to `127.0.0.1:{{restund_udp_status_port}}` when opening a TURN channel. We now explicitly disallow relaying to loopback addresses, 'any' addresses, link local addresses, and the broadcast address. As a workaround disable the `status` module in your restund configuration. However there might still be other services running on `127.0.0.0/8` that you do not want to have exposed. The `turn` module can be disabled. Restund will still perform STUN and this might already be enough for initiating calls in your environments. TURN is only used as a last resort when other NAT traversal options do not work. One should also make sure that the TURN server is set up with firewall rules so that it cannot relay to other addresses that you don't want the TURN server to relay to. For example other services in the same VPC where the TURN server is running. Ideally TURN servers should be deployed in an isolated fashion where they can only reach what they need to reach to perform their task of assisting NAT-traversal.\n\n- CVE-2021-36917: WordPress Hide My WP plugin (versions <= 6.2.3) can be deactivated by any unauthenticated user. It is possible to retrieve a reset token which can then be used to deactivate the plugin.\n\n- CVE-2021-39184: Electron is a framework for writing cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. A vulnerability in versions prior to 11.5.0, 12.1.0, and 13.3.0 allows a sandboxed renderer to request a \"thumbnail\" image of an arbitrary file on the user's system. The thumbnail can potentially include significant parts of the original file, including textual data in many cases. Versions 15.0.0-alpha.10, 14.0.0, 13.3.0, 12.1.0, and 11.5.0 all contain a fix for the vulnerability. Two workarounds aside from upgrading are available. One may make the vulnerability significantly more difficult for an attacker to exploit by enabling `contextIsolation` in one's app. One may also disable the functionality of the `createThumbnailFromPath` API if one does not need it.\n\n- CVE-2021-39231: In Apache Ozone versions prior to 1.2.0, Various internal server-to-server RPC endpoints are available for connections, making it possible for an attacker to download raw data from Datanode and Ozone manager and modify Ratis replication configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-29958: When a download was initiated, the client did not check whether it was in normal or private browsing mode, which led to private mode cookies being shared in normal browsing mode.

All unpatched versions of Argo CD starting with 1.0.0 are vulnerable to an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious user to potentially escalate their privileges to admin-level. Versions starting with 0.8.0 and 0.5.0 contain limited versions of this issue. To perform exploits, an authorized Argo CD user must have push access to an Application's source git or Helm repository or `sync` and `override` access to an Application. Once a user has that access, different exploitation levels are possible depending on their other RBAC privileges. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.2, 2.2.8, and 2.1.14. Some mitigation measures are available but do not serve as a substitute for upgrading. To avoid privilege escalation, limit who has push access to Application source repositories or `sync` + `override` access to Applications; and limit which repositories are available in projects where users have `update` access to Applications. To avoid unauthorized resource inspection/tampering, limit who has `delete`, `get`, or `action` access to Applications.\n\n- CVE-2022-28866: Multiple Improper Access Control was discovered in Nokia AirFrame BMC Web GUI < R18 Firmware v4.13.00.

Sourcegraph prior to version 3.37 is vulnerable to remote code execution in the `gitserver` service. The service acts as a git exec proxy, and fails to properly restrict calling `git config`. This allows an attacker to set the git `core.sshCommand` option, which sets git to use the specified command instead of ssh when they need to connect to a remote system. Exploitation of this vulnerability depends on how Sourcegraph is deployed. An attacker able to make HTTP requests to internal services like gitserver is able to exploit it. This issue is patched in Sourcegraph version 3.37. As a workaround, ensure that requests to gitserver are properly protected.\n\n- CVE-2022-4223: The pgAdmin server includes an HTTP API that is intended to be used to validate the path a user selects to external PostgreSQL utilities such as pg_dump and pg_restore.

It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-5184: API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n\n- CVE-1999-0067: Canonical example of OS command injection.

IBM X-Force ID: 206228.\n\n- CVE-2021-41282: diag_routes.php in pfSense 2.5.2 allows sed data injection. Authenticated users are intended to be able to view data about the routes set in the firewall. The data is retrieved by executing the netstat utility, and then its output is parsed via the sed utility. Although the common protection mechanisms against command injection (i.e., the usage of the escapeshellarg function for the arguments) are used, it is still possible to inject sed-specific code and write an arbitrary file in an arbitrary location.\n\n- CVE-2022-31777: A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Apache Spark 3.2.1 and earlier, and 3.3.0, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the web browser of a user, by including a malicious payload into the logs which would be returned in logs rendered in the UI.\n\n- CVE-2022-28345: The Signal app before 5.34 for iOS allows URI spoofing via RTLO injection. It incorrectly renders RTLO encoded URLs beginning with a non-breaking space, when there is a hash character in the URL. This technique allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to send legitimate looking links, appearing to be any website URL, by abusing the non-http/non-https automatic rendering of URLs. An attacker can spoof, for example, example.com, and masquerade any URL with a malicious destination. An attacker requires a subdomain such as gepj, txt, fdp, or xcod, which would appear backwards as jpeg, txt, pdf, and docx respectively.\n\n- CVE-2022-3941: A vulnerability has been found in Activity Log Plugin and classified as critical.

Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.\n\n- CVE-2022-35954: The GitHub Actions ToolKit provides a set of packages to make creating actions easier. The `core.exportVariable` function uses a well known delimiter that attackers can use to break out of that specific variable and assign values to other arbitrary variables. Workflows that write untrusted values to the `GITHUB_ENV` file may cause the path or other environment variables to be modified without the intention of the workflow or action author. Users should upgrade to `@actions/core v1.9.1`. If you are unable to upgrade the `@actions/core` package, you can modify your action to ensure that any user input does not contain the delimiter `_GitHubActionsFileCommandDelimeter_` before calling `core.exportVariable`.\n\n- CVE-2022-46265: A vulnerability has been identified in Polarion ALM (All versions < V2304.0).

The vulnerability arises due to unsafe usage of the logo_uri parameter in the Dynamic Client Registration request. An unauthenticated attacker can make a HTTP request from the vulnerable server to any address in the internal network and obtain its response (which might, for example, have a JavaScript payload for resultant XSS). The issue can be exploited to bypass network boundaries, obtain sensitive data, or attack other hosts in the internal network.\n\n- CVE-2021-27214: A Server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the ProductConfig servlet in Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus through 6013 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to perform blind HTTP requests or perform a Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against the administrative interface via an HTTP request, a different vulnerability than CVE-2019-3905.\n\n- CVE-2021-21287: MinIO is a High Performance Object Storage released under Apache License v2.0. In MinIO before version RELEASE.2021-01-30T00-20-58Z there is a server-side request forgery vulnerability. The target application may have functionality for importing data from a URL, publishing data to a URL, or otherwise reading data from a URL that can be tampered with. The attacker modifies the calls to this functionality by supplying a completely different URL or by manipulating how URLs are built (path traversal etc.). In a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, the attacker can abuse functionality on the server to read or update internal resources. The attacker can supply or modify a URL which the code running on the server will read or submit data, and by carefully selecting the URLs, the attacker may be able to read server configuration such as AWS metadata, connect to internal services like HTTP enabled databases, or perform post requests towards internal services which are not intended to be exposed. This is fixed in version RELEASE.2021-01-30T00-20-58Z, all users are advised to upgrade. As a workaround you can disable the browser front-end with \"MINIO_BROWSER=off\" environment variable.\n\n- CVE-2021-39303: The server in Jamf Pro before 10.32.0 has an SSRF vulnerability, aka PI-006352. NOTE: Jamf Nation will also publish an article about this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-40091: An SSRF issue was discovered in SquaredUp for SCOM 5.2.1.6654.\n\n- CVE-2021-43780: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.\n\n- CVE-2021-27561: Yealink Device Management (DM) 3.6.0.20 allows command injection as root via the /sm/api/v1/firewall/zone/services URI, without authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-29475: HedgeDoc (formerly known as CodiMD) is an open-source collaborative markdown editor. An attacker is able to receive arbitrary files from the file system when exporting a note to PDF. Since the code injection has to take place as note content, there fore this exploit requires the attackers ability to modify a note. This will affect all instances, which have pdf export enabled. This issue has been fixed by https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/c1789474020a6d668d616464cb2da5e90e123f65 and is available in version 1.5.0. Starting the CodiMD/HedgeDoc instance with `CMD_ALLOW_PDF_EXPORT=false` or set `\"allowPDFExport\": false` in config.json can mitigate this issue for those who cannot upgrade. This exploit works because while PhantomJS doesn't actually render the `file:///` references to the PDF file itself, it still uses them internally, and exfiltration is possible, and easy through JavaScript rendering. The impact is pretty bad, as the attacker is able to read the CodiMD/HedgeDoc `config.json` file as well any other files on the filesystem. Even though the suggested Docker deploy option doesn't have many interesting files itself, the `config.json` still often contains sensitive information, database credentials, and maybe OAuth secrets among other things.\n\n- CVE-2021-45968: An issue was discovered in xmppserver jar in the XMPP Server component of the JIve platform, as used in Pascom Cloud Phone System before 7.20.x (and in other products).

This has been patched and is available in release [v0.12.1](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/releases/tag/v0.12.1). We recommend that all users running self-hosted `charm` instances update immediately. This vulnerability was found in-house and we haven't been notified of any potential exploiters. ### Additional notes * Encrypted user data uploaded to the Charm server is safe as Charm servers cannot decrypt user data. This includes filenames, paths, and all key-value data. * Users running the official Charm [Docker images](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/blob/main/docker.md) are at minimal risk because the exploit is limited to the containerized filesystem.\n\n- CVE-2022-29847: In Progress Ipswitch WhatsUp Gold 21.0.0 through 21.1.1, and 22.0.0, it is possible for an unauthenticated attacker to invoke an API transaction that would allow them to relay encrypted WhatsUp Gold user credentials to an arbitrary host.\n\n- CVE-2022-39055: RAVA certificate validation system has inadequate filtering for URL parameter. An unauthenticated remote attacker can perform SSRF attack to discover internal network topology base on query response.\n\n- CVE-2022-36997: An issue was discovered in Veritas NetBackup 8.1.x through 8.1.2, 8.2, 8.3.x through 8.3.0.2, 9.x through 9.0.0.1, and 9.1.x through 9.1.0.1 (and related NetBackup products). An attacker with authenticated access to a NetBackup Client could remotely trigger impacts that include arbitrary file read, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), and denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2022-0528: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in GitHub repository transloadit/uppy prior to 3.3.1. \n\n- CVE-2022-1815: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor in GitHub repository jgraph/drawio prior to 18.1.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-20325: Missing fixes for CVE-2021-40438 and CVE-2021-26691 in the versions of httpd, as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.5.0, causes a security regression compared to the versions shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4. A user who installs or updates to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.5.0 would be vulnerable to the mentioned CVEs, even if they were properly fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4. CVE-2021-20325 was assigned to that Red Hat specific security regression and it does not affect the upstream versions of httpd.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-441 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-610 (ChildOf)",

            "extended_description": "\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.",

Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.",

An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.\n\t\t2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.\n```\nFor example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-45918: Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n\n- CVE-2008-5748: Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.\n\n- CVE-2008-5764: Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-19155: Improper Access Control in Jfinal CMS v4.7.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information and/or execute arbitrary code via the 'FileManager.rename()' function in the component 'modules/filemanager/FileManagerController.java'.\n\n- CVE-2021-40639: Improper access control in Jfinal CMS 5.1.0 allows attackers to access sensitive information via /classes/conf/db.properties&config=filemanager.config.js.\n\n- CVE-2021-27236: An issue was discovered in Mutare Voice (EVM) 3.x before 3.3.8. getfile.asp allows Unauthenticated Local File Inclusion, which can be leveraged to achieve Remote Code Execution.\n\n- CVE-2021-22539: An attacker can place a crafted JSON config file into the project folder pointing to a custom executable. VScode-bazel allows the workspace path to lint *.bzl files to be set via this config file. As such the attacker is able to execute any executable on the system through vscode-bazel. We recommend upgrading to version 0.4.1 or above.\n\n- CVE-2021-22009: The vCenter Server contains multiple denial-of-service vulnerabilities in VAPI (vCenter API) service. A malicious actor with network access to port 443 on vCenter Server may exploit these issues to create a denial of service condition due to excessive memory consumption by VAPI service.\n\n- CVE-2021-34539: An issue was discovered in CubeCoders AMP before 2.1.1.8. A lack of validation of the Java Version setting means that an unintended executable path can be set. The result is that high-privileged users can trigger code execution.\n\n- CVE-2021-43893: Windows Encrypting File System (EFS) Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-43066: A external control of file name or path in Fortinet FortiClientWindows version 7.0.2 and below, version 6.4.6 and below, version 6.2.9 and below, version 6.0.10 and below allows attacker to escalate privilege via the MSI installer.\n\n- CVE-2022-24900: Piano LED Visualizer is software that allows LED lights to light up as a person plays a piano connected to a computer. Version 1.3 and prior are vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The `os.path.join` call is unsafe for use with untrusted input. When the `os.path.join` call encounters an absolute path, it ignores all the parameters it has encountered till that point and starts working with the new absolute path. Since the \"malicious\" parameter represents an absolute path, the result of `os.path.join` ignores the static directory completely. Hence, untrusted input is passed via the `os.path.join` call to `flask.send_file` can lead to path traversal attacks. A patch with a fix is available on the `master` branch of the GitHub repository. This can also be fixed by preventing flow of untrusted data to the vulnerable `send_file` function. In case the application logic necessiates this behaviour, one can either use the `flask.safe_join` to join untrusted paths or replace `flask.send_file` calls with `flask.send_from_directory` calls.\n\n- CVE-2022-34765: A CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path vulnerability exists that could cause loading of unauthorized firmware images when user-controlled data is written to the file path. Affected Products: X80 advanced RTU Communication Module (BMENOR2200H) (V2.01 and later), OPC UA Modicon Communication Module (BMENUA0100) (V1.10 and prior)\n\n- CVE-2022-39952: A external control of file name or path in Fortinet FortiNAC versions 9.4.0, 9.2.0 through 9.2.5, 9.1.0 through 9.1.7, 8.8.0 through 8.8.11, 8.7.0 through 8.7.6, 8.6.0 through 8.6.5, 8.5.0 through 8.5.4, 8.3.7 may allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands via specifically crafted HTTP request.\n\n- CVE-2022-45918: ILIAS before 7.16 allows External Control of File Name or Path.\n\n- CVE-2022-23118: Jenkins Debian Package Builder Plugin 1.6.11 and earlier implements functionality that allows agents to invoke command-line `git` at an attacker-specified path on the controller, allowing attackers able to control agent processes to invoke arbitrary OS commands on the controller.\n\n- CVE-2022-25643: seatd-launch in seatd 0.6.x before 0.6.4 allows removing files with escalated privileges when installed setuid root. The attack vector is a user-supplied socket pathname.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-642 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-610 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-20 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-22 (CanPrecede)\n\n- CWE-41 (CanPrecede)\n\n- CWE-98 (CanPrecede)\n\n- CWE-434 (CanPrecede)\n\n- CWE-59 (CanPrecede)",

NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-11736.\n\n- CVE-2021-21272: ORAS is open source software which enables a way to push OCI Artifacts to OCI Conformant registries. ORAS is both a CLI for initial testing and a Go Module. In ORAS from version 0.4.0 and before version 0.9.0, there is a \"zip-slip\" vulnerability. The directory support feature allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links and hard links. A well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who runs `oras pull`. Users of the affected versions are impacted if they are `oras` CLI users who runs `oras pull`, or if they are Go programs, which invoke `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`. The problem has been fixed in version 0.9.0. For `oras` CLI users, there is no workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider. For `oras` package users, the workaround is to not use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`, and use other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider.\n\n- CVE-2021-28650: autoar-extractor.c in GNOME gnome-autoar before 0.3.1, as used by GNOME Shell, Nautilus, and other software, allows Directory Traversal during extraction because it lacks a check of whether a file's parent is a symlink in certain complex situations. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-36241.\n\n- CVE-2021-32518: A vulnerability in share_link in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote attackers to create a symbolic link then access arbitrary files. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32803: The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.4.15, and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via insufficient symlink protection. `node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-32825: bblfshd is an open source self-hosted server for source code parsing. In bblfshd before commit 4265465b9b6fb5663c30ee43806126012066aad4 there is a \"zipslip\" vulnerability. The unsafe handling of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may enable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations outside the designated target folder. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive file. Additionally, if the attacker has read access to the unpacked files, he may be able to read arbitrary system files the parent process has permissions to read. For more details including a PoC see the referenced GHSL-2020-258.\n\n- CVE-2021-36286: Dell SupportAssist Client Consumer versions 3.9.13.0 and any versions prior to 3.9.13.0 contain an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability that can be exploited by using the Windows feature of NTFS called Symbolic links. Symbolic links can be created by any(non-privileged) user under some object directories, but by themselves are not sufficient to successfully escalate privileges. However, combining them with a different object, such as the NTFS junction point allows for the exploitation. Support assist clean files functionality do not distinguish junction points from the physical folder and proceeds to clean the target of the junction that allows nonprivileged users to create junction points and delete arbitrary files on the system which can be accessed only by the admin.\n\n- CVE-2021-38511: An issue was discovered in the tar crate before 0.4.36 for Rust. When symlinks are present in a TAR archive, extraction can create arbitrary directories via .. traversal.\n\n- CVE-2021-29136: Open Container Initiative umoci before 0.4.7 allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary host paths via a crafted image that causes symlink traversal when \"umoci unpack\" or \"umoci raw unpack\" is used.\n\n- CVE-2020-27833: A Zip Slip vulnerability was found in the oc binary in openshift-clients where an arbitrary file write is achieved by using a specially crafted raw container image (.tar file) which contains symbolic links. The vulnerability is limited to the command `oc image extract`. If a symbolic link is first created pointing within the tarball, this allows further symbolic links to bypass the existing path check. This flaw allows the tarball to create links outside the tarball's parent directory, allowing for executables or configuration files to be overwritten, resulting in arbitrary code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. Versions up to and including openshift-clients-4.7.0-202104250659.p0.git.95881af are affected.\n\n- CVE-2020-27697: Trend Micro Security 2020 (Consumer) contains a vulnerability in the installer package that could be exploited by placing a malicious DLL in a non-protected location with high privileges (symlink attack) which can lead to obtaining administrative privileges during the installation of the product.\n\n- CVE-2020-4717: A vulnerability exists in IBM SPSS Modeler Subscription Installer that allows a user with create symbolic link permission to write arbitrary file in another protected path during product installation. IBM X-Force ID: 187727.\n\n- CVE-2021-23239: The sudoedit personality of Sudo before 1.9.5 may allow a local unprivileged user to perform arbitrary directory-existence tests by winning a sudo_edit.c race condition in replacing a user-controlled directory by a symlink to an arbitrary path.\n\n- CVE-2021-32508: Absolute Path Traversal vulnerability in FileStreaming in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote authenticated attackers access arbitrary files by injecting the Symbolic Link following the Url path parameter. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32509: Absolute Path Traversal vulnerability in FileviewDoc in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote authenticated attackers access arbitrary files by injecting the Symbolic Link following the Url path parameter.

It affects multi-user setups in which \u2019guix-daemon\u2019 runs locally. The attack consists in having an unprivileged user spawn a build process, for instance with `guix build`, that makes its build directory world-writable. The user then creates a hardlink to a root-owned file such as /etc/shadow in that build directory. If the user passed the --keep-failed option and the build eventually fails, the daemon changes ownership of the whole build tree, including the hardlink, to the user. At that point, the user has write access to the target file. Versions after and including v0.11.0-3298-g2608e40988, and versions prior to v1.2.0-75109-g94f0312546 are vulnerable.\n\n- CVE-2020-28007: Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows Execution with Unnecessary Privileges.

These exposures can be inadvertent (bug) or intentional (design).\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2002-2094: This, and others, use \"..\" attacks and monitor error responses, so there is overlap with directory traversal.\n\n- CVE-2001-1483: Enumeration of valid usernames based on inconsistent responses\n\n- CVE-2001-1528: Account number enumeration via inconsistent responses.\n\n- CVE-2004-2150: User enumeration via discrepancies in error messages.\n\n- CVE-2005-1650: User enumeration via discrepancies in error messages.\n\n- CVE-2004-0294: Bulletin Board displays different error messages when a user exists or not, which makes it easier for remote attackers to identify valid users and conduct a brute force password guessing attack.\n\n- CVE-2004-0243: Operating System, when direct remote login is disabled, displays a different message if the password is correct, which allows remote attackers to guess the password via brute force methods.\n\n- CVE-2002-0514: Product allows remote attackers to determine if a port is being filtered because the response packet TTL is different than the default TTL.\n\n- CVE-2002-0515: Product sets a different TTL when a port is being filtered than when it is not being filtered, which allows remote attackers to identify filtered ports by comparing TTLs.\n\n- CVE-2001-1387: Product may generate different responses than specified by the administrator, possibly leading to an information leak.\n\n- CVE-2004-0778: Version control system allows remote attackers to determine the existence of arbitrary files and directories via the -X command for an alternate history file, which causes different error messages to be returned.\n\n- CVE-2004-1428: FTP server generates an error message if the user name does not exist instead of prompting for a password, which allows remote attackers to determine valid usernames.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0086: Observable response discrepancy in floating-point operations for some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-0089: Observable response discrepancy in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-20376: IBM Sterling File Gateway 2.2.0.0 through 6.1.1.0 could allow an authenticated attacker to enumerate usernames due to there being an observable discrepancy in returned messages. IBM X-Force ID: 195568.\n\n- CVE-2021-37151: CyberArk Identity 21.5.131, when handling an invalid authentication attempt, sometimes reveals whether the username is valid. In certain authentication policy configurations with MFA, the API response length can be used to differentiate between a valid user and an invalid one (aka Username Enumeration). Response differentiation enables attackers to enumerate usernames of valid application users. Attackers can use this information to leverage brute-force and dictionary attacks in order to discover valid account information such as passwords.\n\n- CVE-2021-37968: Inappropriate implementation in Background Fetch API in Google Chrome prior to 94.0.4606.54 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2020-35518: When binding against a DN during authentication, the reply from 389-ds-base will be different whether the DN exists or not. This can be used by an unauthenticated attacker to check the existence of an entry in the LDAP database.\n\n- CVE-2021-27583: In Directus 8.x through 8.8.1, an attacker can discover whether a user is present in the database through the password reset feature. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer\n\n- CVE-2021-22892: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Rocket.Chat server fixed v3.13, v3.12.2 & v3.11.3 that allowed email addresses to be disclosed by enumeration and validation checks.\n\n- CVE-2021-44848: In Cibele Thinfinity VirtualUI before 3.0, /changePassword returns different responses for invalid authentication requests depending on whether the username exists.\n\n- CVE-2021-20049: A vulnerability in SonicWall SMA100 password change API allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to perform SMA100 username enumeration based on the server responses. This vulnerability impacts 10.2.1.2-24sv, 10.2.0.8-37sv and earlier 10.x versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-24784: Statamic is a Laravel and Git powered CMS. Before versions 3.2.39 and 3.3.2, it is possible to confirm a single character of a user's password hash using a specially crafted regular expression filter in the users endpoint of the REST API. Multiple such requests can eventually uncover the entire hash. The hash is not present in the response, however the presence or absence of a result confirms if the character is in the right position. The API has throttling enabled by default, making this a time intensive task. Both the REST API and the users endpoint need to be enabled, as they are disabled by default. The issue has been fixed in versions 3.2.39 and above, and 3.3.2 and above.\n\n- CVE-2021-20147: ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus below build 6116 contains an observable response discrepancy in the UMCP operation of the ChangePasswordAPI. This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to determine whether a Windows domain user exists.\n\n- CVE-2021-38009: Inappropriate implementation in cache in Google Chrome prior to 96.0.4664.45 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-1139: Inappropriate implementation in Background Fetch API in Google Chrome prior to 100.0.4896.60 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-27814: SWHKD 1.1.5 allows arbitrary file-existence tests via the -c option.\n\n- CVE-2022-47952: lxc-user-nic in lxc through 5.0.1 is installed setuid root, and may allow local users to infer whether any file exists, even within a protected directory tree, because \"Failed to open\" often indicates that a file does not exist, whereas \"does not refer to a network namespace path\" often indicates that a file exists. NOTE: this is different from CVE-2018-6556 because the CVE-2018-6556 fix design was based on the premise that \"we will report back to the user that the open() failed but the user has no way of knowing why it failed\"; however, in many realistic cases, there are no plausible reasons for failing except that the file does not exist.\n\n- CVE-2022-24032: Adenza AxiomSL ControllerView through 10.8.1 is vulnerable to user enumeration. An attacker can identify valid usernames on the platform because a failed login attempt produces a different error message when the username is valid.\n\n- CVE-2022-0569: Observable Discrepancy in Packagist snipe/snipe-it prior to v5.3.9. \n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-203 (ChildOf)",

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrative permissions, to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2022-36065: GrowthBook is an open-source platform for feature flagging and A/B testing. With some self-hosted configurations in versions prior to 2022-08-29, attackers can register new accounts and upload files to arbitrary directories within the container. If the attacker uploads a Python script to the right location, they can execute arbitrary code within the container. To be affected, ALL of the following must be true: Self-hosted deployment (GrowthBook Cloud is unaffected); using local file uploads (as opposed to S3 or Google Cloud Storage); NODE_ENV set to a non-production value and JWT_SECRET set to an easily guessable string like `dev`. This issue is patched in commit 1a5edff8786d141161bf880c2fd9ccbe2850a264 (2022-08-29). As a workaround, set `JWT_SECRET` environment variable to a long random string. This will stop arbitrary file uploads, but the only way to stop attackers from registering accounts is by updating to the latest build.\n\n- CVE-2022-3060: Improper control of a resource identifier in Error Tracking in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 12.7 allows an authenticated attacker to generate content which could cause a victim to make unintended arbitrary requests\n\n- CVE-2022-32409: A local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in the component codemirror.php of Portal do Software Publico Brasileiro i3geo v7.0.5 allows attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a crafted HTTP request.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-23 (ChildOf)",

No Windows Service or separate process required. Dashboard UI in Hangfire.Core uses authorization filters to protect it from showing sensitive data to unauthorized users. By default when no custom authorization filters specified, `LocalRequestsOnlyAuthorizationFilter` filter is being used to allow only local requests and prohibit all the remote requests to provide sensible, protected by default settings. However due to the recent changes, in version 1.7.25 no authorization filters are used by default, allowing remote requests to succeed. If you are using `UseHangfireDashboard` method with default `DashboardOptions.Authorization` property value, then your installation is impacted. If any other authorization filter is specified in the `DashboardOptions.Authorization` property, the you are not impacted. Patched versions (1.7.26) are available both on Nuget.org and as a tagged release on the github repo. Default authorization rules now prohibit remote requests by default again by including the `LocalRequestsOnlyAuthorizationFilter` filter to the default settings. Please upgrade to the newest version in order to mitigate the issue. For users who are unable to upgrade it is possible to mitigate the issue by using the `LocalRequestsOnlyAuthorizationFilter` explicitly when configuring the Dashboard UI.\n\n- CVE-2021-42062: SAP ERP HCM Portugal does not perform necessary authorization checks for a report that reads the payroll data of employees in a certain area. Since the affected report only reads the payroll information, the attacker can neither modify any information nor cause availability impacts.\n\n- CVE-2021-42359: WP DSGVO Tools (GDPR) <= 3.1.23 had an AJAX action, \u2018admin-dismiss-unsubscribe\u2018, which lacked a capability check and a nonce check and was available to unauthenticated users, and did not check the post type when deleting unsubscription requests. As such, it was possible for an attacker to permanently delete an arbitrary post or page on the site by sending an AJAX request with the \u201caction\u201d parameter set to \u201cadmin-dismiss-unsubscribe\u201d and the \u201cid\u201d parameter set to the post to be deleted. Sending such a request would move the post to the trash, and repeating the request would permanently delete the post in question.\n\n- CVE-2021-1143: A vulnerability in Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) API authorizations could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to enumerate what users exist on the system. The vulnerability is due to a lack of authorization checks for certain API GET requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific API GET requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to enumerate users of the CMX system.\n\n- CVE-2021-20283: The web service responsible for fetching other users' enrolled courses did not validate that the requesting user had permission to view that information in each course in moodle before 3.10.2, 3.9.5, 3.8.8, 3.5.17.\n\n- CVE-2021-21481: The MigrationService, which is part of SAP NetWeaver versions 7.10, 7.11, 7.20, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50, does not perform an authorization check. This might allow an unauthorized attacker to access configuration objects, including such that grant administrative privileges. This could result in complete compromise of system confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\n- CVE-2021-27509: In Visualware MyConnection Server before 11.0b build 5382, each published report is not associated with its own access code.\n\n- CVE-2021-34647: The Ninja Forms WordPress plugin is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure via the bulk_export_submissions function found in the ~/includes/Routes/Submissions.php file, in versions up to and including 3.5.7. This allows authenticated attackers to export all Ninja Forms submissions data via the /ninja-forms-submissions/export REST API which can include personally identifiable information.\n\n- CVE-2021-34648: The Ninja Forms WordPress plugin is vulnerable to arbitrary email sending via the trigger_email_action function found in the ~/includes/Routes/Submissions.php file, in versions up to and including 3.5.7. This allows authenticated attackers to send arbitrary emails from the affected server via the /ninja-forms-submissions/email-action REST API which can be used to socially engineer victims.\n\n- CVE-2021-36909: Authenticated Database Reset vulnerability in WordPress WP Reset PRO Premium plugin (versions <= 5.98) allows any authenticated user to wipe the entire database regardless of their authorization. It leads to a complete website reset and takeover.\n\n- CVE-2021-38698: HashiCorp Consul and Consul Enterprise 1.10.1 Txn.Apply endpoint allowed services to register proxies for other services, enabling access to service traffic.

Because of not checking authorization in ids parameter in files-edit.php and id parameter in process.php function, a user with uploader role can download and edit all files of users in application.\n\n- CVE-2021-41554: ARCHIBUS Web Central 21.3.3.815 (a version from 2014) does not properly validate requests for access to data and functionality in these affected endpoints: /archibus/schema/ab-edit-users.axvw, /archibus/schema/ab-data-dictionary-table.axvw, /archibus/schema/ab-schema-add-field.axvw, /archibus/schema/ab-core/views/process-navigator/ab-my-user-profile.axvw. By not verifying the permissions for access to resources, it allows a potential attacker to view pages that are not allowed. Specifically, it was found that any authenticated user can reach the administrative console for user management by directly requesting access to the page via URL. This allows a malicious user to modify all users' profiles, to elevate any privileges to administrative ones, or to create or delete any type of user. It is also possible to modify the emails of other users, through a misconfiguration of the username parameter, on the user profile page. This is fixed in all recent versions, such as version 26. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. Version 21.3 was officially de-supported by the end of 2020\n\n- CVE-2021-1506: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or gain access to sensitive information, or allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain escalated privileges or gain unauthorized access to the application. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.\n\n- CVE-2021-21432: Vela is a Pipeline Automation (CI/CD) framework built on Linux container technology written in Golang.

Refer to the referenced GitHub Security Advisory for complete details. This is fixed in version 0.7.5.\n\n- CVE-2021-32748: Nextcloud Richdocuments in an open source self hosted online office. Nextcloud uses the WOPI (\"Web Application Open Platform Interface\") protocol to communicate with the Collabora Editor, the communication between these two services was not protected by a credentials or IP check. Whilst this does not result in gaining access to data that the user has not yet access to, it can result in a bypass of any enforced watermark on documents as described on the [Nextcloud Virtual Data Room](https://nextcloud.com/virtual-data-room/) website and [our documentation](https://portal.nextcloud.com/article/nextcloud-and-virtual-data-room-configuration-59.html). The Nextcloud Richdocuments releases 3.8.3 and 4.2.0 add an additional admin settings for an allowlist of IP addresses that can access the WOPI API. We recommend upgrading and configuring the allowlist to a list of Collabora servers. There is no known workaround. Note that this primarily results a bypass of any configured watermark or download protection using File Access Control. If you do not require or rely on these as a security feature no immediate action is required on your end.\n\n- CVE-2021-3653: A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the \"int_ctl\" field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.14-rc7.\n\n- CVE-2021-25409: Improper access in Notification setting prior to SMR JUN-2021 Release 1 allows physically proximate attackers to set arbitrary notification via physically configuring device.\n\n- CVE-2021-24851: The Insert Pages WordPress plugin before 3.7.0 allows users with a role as low as Contributor to access content and metadata from arbitrary posts/pages regardless of their author and status (ie private), using a shortcode. Password protected posts/pages are not affected by such issue.\n\n- CVE-2021-21984: VMware vRealize Business for Cloud 7.x prior to 7.6.0 contains a remote code execution vulnerability due to an unauthorised end point. A malicious actor with network access may exploit this issue causing unauthorised remote code execution on vRealize Business for Cloud Virtual Appliance.\n\n- CVE-2021-27903: An issue was discovered in Craft CMS before 3.6.7. In some circumstances, a potential Remote Code Execution vulnerability existed on sites that did not restrict administrative changes (if an attacker were somehow able to hijack an administrator's session).\n\n- CVE-2021-35413: A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in course_intro_pdf_import.php of Chamilo LMS v1.11.x allows authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted .htaccess file.\n\n- CVE-2021-21382: Restund is an open source NAT traversal server. The restund TURN server can be instructed to open a relay to the loopback address range. This allows you to reach any other service running on localhost which you might consider private. In the configuration that we ship (https://github.com/wireapp/ansible-restund/blob/master/templates/restund.conf.j2#L40-L43) the `status` interface of restund is enabled and is listening on `127.0.0.1`.The `status` interface allows users to issue administrative commands to `restund` like listing open relays or draining connections. It would be possible for an attacker to contact the status interface and issue administrative commands by setting `XOR-PEER-ADDRESS` to `127.0.0.1:{{restund_udp_status_port}}` when opening a TURN channel. We now explicitly disallow relaying to loopback addresses, 'any' addresses, link local addresses, and the broadcast address. As a workaround disable the `status` module in your restund configuration. However there might still be other services running on `127.0.0.0/8` that you do not want to have exposed. The `turn` module can be disabled. Restund will still perform STUN and this might already be enough for initiating calls in your environments. TURN is only used as a last resort when other NAT traversal options do not work. One should also make sure that the TURN server is set up with firewall rules so that it cannot relay to other addresses that you don't want the TURN server to relay to. For example other services in the same VPC where the TURN server is running. Ideally TURN servers should be deployed in an isolated fashion where they can only reach what they need to reach to perform their task of assisting NAT-traversal.\n\n- CVE-2021-36917: WordPress Hide My WP plugin (versions <= 6.2.3) can be deactivated by any unauthenticated user. It is possible to retrieve a reset token which can then be used to deactivate the plugin.\n\n- CVE-2021-39184: Electron is a framework for writing cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. A vulnerability in versions prior to 11.5.0, 12.1.0, and 13.3.0 allows a sandboxed renderer to request a \"thumbnail\" image of an arbitrary file on the user's system. The thumbnail can potentially include significant parts of the original file, including textual data in many cases. Versions 15.0.0-alpha.10, 14.0.0, 13.3.0, 12.1.0, and 11.5.0 all contain a fix for the vulnerability. Two workarounds aside from upgrading are available. One may make the vulnerability significantly more difficult for an attacker to exploit by enabling `contextIsolation` in one's app. One may also disable the functionality of the `createThumbnailFromPath` API if one does not need it.\n\n- CVE-2021-39231: In Apache Ozone versions prior to 1.2.0, Various internal server-to-server RPC endpoints are available for connections, making it possible for an attacker to download raw data from Datanode and Ozone manager and modify Ratis replication configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-29958: When a download was initiated, the client did not check whether it was in normal or private browsing mode, which led to private mode cookies being shared in normal browsing mode. This vulnerability affects Firefox for iOS < 34.\n\n- CVE-2020-11511: The LearnPress plugin before 3.2.6.9 for WordPress allows remote attackers to escalate the privileges of any user to LP Instructor via the accept-to-be-teacher action parameter.\n\n- CVE-2020-11967: In IQrouter through 3.3.1, remote attackers can control the device (restart network, reboot, upgrade, reset) because of Incorrect Access Control. Note: The vendor claims that this vulnerability can only occur on a brand-new network that, after initiating the forced initial configuration (which has a required step for setting a secure password on the system), makes this CVE invalid. This vulnerability is \u201ctrue for any unconfigured release of OpenWRT, and true of many other new Linux distros prior to being configured for the first time\u201d\n\n- CVE-2021-24184: Several AJAX endpoints in the Tutor LMS \u2013 eLearning and online course solution WordPress plugin before 1.7.7 were unprotected, allowing students to modify course information and elevate their privileges among many other actions.\n\n- CVE-2021-24354: A lack of capability checks and insufficient nonce check on the AJAX action in the Simple 301 Redirects by BetterLinks WordPress plugin before 2.0.4, made it possible for authenticated users to install arbitrary plugins on vulnerable sites.\n\n- CVE-2021-26758: Privilege Escalation in LiteSpeed Technologies OpenLiteSpeed web server version 1.7.8 allows attackers to gain root terminal access and execute commands on the host system.\n\n- CVE-2021-38388: Central Dogma allows privilege escalation with mirroring to the internal dogma repository that has a file managing the authorization of the project.\n\n- CVE-2020-25629: A vulnerability was found in Moodle where users with \"Log in as\" capability in a course context (typically, course managers) may gain access to some site administration capabilities by \"logging in as\" a System manager.

All unpatched versions of Argo CD starting with 1.0.0 are vulnerable to an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious user to potentially escalate their privileges to admin-level. Versions starting with 0.8.0 and 0.5.0 contain limited versions of this issue. To perform exploits, an authorized Argo CD user must have push access to an Application's source git or Helm repository or `sync` and `override` access to an Application. Once a user has that access, different exploitation levels are possible depending on their other RBAC privileges. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.2, 2.2.8, and 2.1.14. Some mitigation measures are available but do not serve as a substitute for upgrading. To avoid privilege escalation, limit who has push access to Application source repositories or `sync` + `override` access to Applications; and limit which repositories are available in projects where users have `update` access to Applications. To avoid unauthorized resource inspection/tampering, limit who has `delete`, `get`, or `action` access to Applications.\n\n- CVE-2022-28866: Multiple Improper Access Control was discovered in Nokia AirFrame BMC Web GUI < R18 Firmware v4.13.00.

Sourcegraph prior to version 3.37 is vulnerable to remote code execution in the `gitserver` service. The service acts as a git exec proxy, and fails to properly restrict calling `git config`. This allows an attacker to set the git `core.sshCommand` option, which sets git to use the specified command instead of ssh when they need to connect to a remote system. Exploitation of this vulnerability depends on how Sourcegraph is deployed. An attacker able to make HTTP requests to internal services like gitserver is able to exploit it. This issue is patched in Sourcegraph version 3.37. As a workaround, ensure that requests to gitserver are properly protected.\n\n- CVE-2022-4223: The pgAdmin server includes an HTTP API that is intended to be used to validate the path a user selects to external PostgreSQL utilities such as pg_dump and pg_restore.

Dex instances with public clients (and by extension, clients accepting tokens issued by those Dex instances) are affected by this vulnerability if they are running a version prior to 2.35.0. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by making a victim navigate to a malicious website and guiding them through the OIDC flow, stealing the OAuth authorization code in the process. The authorization code then can be exchanged by the attacker for a token, gaining access to applications accepting that token. Version 2.35.0 has introduced a fix for this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-39289: ZoneMinder is a free, open source Closed-circuit television software application.

It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-5184: API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n\n- CVE-1999-0067: Canonical example of OS command injection.

Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.\n\n- CVE-2022-35954: The GitHub Actions ToolKit provides a set of packages to make creating actions easier. The `core.exportVariable` function uses a well known delimiter that attackers can use to break out of that specific variable and assign values to other arbitrary variables. Workflows that write untrusted values to the `GITHUB_ENV` file may cause the path or other environment variables to be modified without the intention of the workflow or action author. Users should upgrade to `@actions/core v1.9.1`.

The vulnerability arises due to unsafe usage of the logo_uri parameter in the Dynamic Client Registration request. An unauthenticated attacker can make a HTTP request from the vulnerable server to any address in the internal network and obtain its response (which might, for example, have a JavaScript payload for resultant XSS). The issue can be exploited to bypass network boundaries, obtain sensitive data, or attack other hosts in the internal network.\n\n- CVE-2021-27214: A Server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the ProductConfig servlet in Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus through 6013 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to perform blind HTTP requests or perform a Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against the administrative interface via an HTTP request, a different vulnerability than CVE-2019-3905.\n\n- CVE-2021-21287: MinIO is a High Performance Object Storage released under Apache License v2.0. In MinIO before version RELEASE.2021-01-30T00-20-58Z there is a server-side request forgery vulnerability. The target application may have functionality for importing data from a URL, publishing data to a URL, or otherwise reading data from a URL that can be tampered with. The attacker modifies the calls to this functionality by supplying a completely different URL or by manipulating how URLs are built (path traversal etc.). In a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, the attacker can abuse functionality on the server to read or update internal resources. The attacker can supply or modify a URL which the code running on the server will read or submit data, and by carefully selecting the URLs, the attacker may be able to read server configuration such as AWS metadata, connect to internal services like HTTP enabled databases, or perform post requests towards internal services which are not intended to be exposed. This is fixed in version RELEASE.2021-01-30T00-20-58Z, all users are advised to upgrade. As a workaround you can disable the browser front-end with \"MINIO_BROWSER=off\" environment variable.\n\n- CVE-2021-39303: The server in Jamf Pro before 10.32.0 has an SSRF vulnerability, aka PI-006352. NOTE: Jamf Nation will also publish an article about this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-40091: An SSRF issue was discovered in SquaredUp for SCOM 5.2.1.6654.\n\n- CVE-2021-43780: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.\n\n- CVE-2021-27561: Yealink Device Management (DM) 3.6.0.20 allows command injection as root via the /sm/api/v1/firewall/zone/services URI, without authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-29475: HedgeDoc (formerly known as CodiMD) is an open-source collaborative markdown editor. An attacker is able to receive arbitrary files from the file system when exporting a note to PDF. Since the code injection has to take place as note content, there fore this exploit requires the attackers ability to modify a note. This will affect all instances, which have pdf export enabled. This issue has been fixed by https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/c1789474020a6d668d616464cb2da5e90e123f65 and is available in version 1.5.0. Starting the CodiMD/HedgeDoc instance with `CMD_ALLOW_PDF_EXPORT=false` or set `\"allowPDFExport\": false` in config.json can mitigate this issue for those who cannot upgrade. This exploit works because while PhantomJS doesn't actually render the `file:///` references to the PDF file itself, it still uses them internally, and exfiltration is possible, and easy through JavaScript rendering. The impact is pretty bad, as the attacker is able to read the CodiMD/HedgeDoc `config.json` file as well any other files on the filesystem. Even though the suggested Docker deploy option doesn't have many interesting files itself, the `config.json` still often contains sensitive information, database credentials, and maybe OAuth secrets among other things.\n\n- CVE-2021-45968: An issue was discovered in xmppserver jar in the XMPP Server component of the JIve platform, as used in Pascom Cloud Phone System before 7.20.x (and in other products). An endpoint in the backend Tomcat server of the Pascom allows SSRF, a related issue to CVE-2019-18394.\n\n- CVE-2021-21973: The vSphere Client (HTML5) contains an SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery) vulnerability due to improper validation of URLs in a vCenter Server plugin. A malicious actor with network access to port 443 may exploit this issue by sending a POST request to vCenter Server plugin leading to information disclosure. This affects: VMware vCenter Server (7.x before 7.0 U1c, 6.7 before 6.7 U3l and 6.5 before 6.5 U3n) and VMware Cloud Foundation (4.x before 4.2 and 3.x before 3.10.1.2).\n\n- CVE-2021-21975: Server Side Request Forgery in vRealize Operations Manager API (CVE-2021-21975) prior to 8.4 may allow a malicious actor with network access to the vRealize Operations Manager API can perform a Server Side Request Forgery attack to steal administrative credentials.\n\n- CVE-2021-27103: Accellion FTA 9_12_411 and earlier is affected by SSRF via a crafted POST request to wmProgressstat.html. The fixed version is FTA_9_12_416 and later.\n\n- CVE-2021-40438: A crafted request uri-path can cause mod_proxy to forward the request to an origin server choosen by the remote user. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.48 and earlier.\n\n- CVE-2021-22986: On BIG-IP versions 16.0.x before 16.0.1.1, 15.1.x before 15.1.2.1, 14.1.x before 14.1.4, 13.1.x before 13.1.3.6, and 12.1.x before 12.1.5.3 amd BIG-IQ 7.1.0.x before 7.1.0.3 and 7.0.0.x before 7.0.0.2, the iControl REST interface has an unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability. Note: Software versions which have reached End of Software Development (EoSD) are not evaluated.\n\n- CVE-2021-26855: Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-34473: Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-40604: A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in IPS Community Suite before 4.6.2 allows remote authenticated users to request arbitrary URLs or trigger deserialization via phar protocol when generating class names dynamically. In some cases an exploitation is possible by an unauthenticated user.\n\n- CVE-2022-1592: Server-Side Request Forgery in scout in GitHub repository clinical-genomics/scout prior to v4.42. An attacker could make the application perform arbitrary requests to fishing steal cookie, request to private area, or lead to xss...\n\n- CVE-2022-23544: MeterSphere is a one-stop open source continuous testing platform, covering test management, interface testing, UI testing and performance testing. Versions prior to 2.5.0 are subject to a Server-Side Request Forgery that leads to Cross-Site Scripting. A Server-Side request forgery in `IssueProxyResourceService::getMdImageByUrl` allows an attacker to access internal resources, as well as executing JavaScript code in the context of Metersphere's origin by a victim of a reflected XSS. This vulnerability has been fixed in v2.5.0. There are no known workarounds.\n\n- CVE-2022-41040: Microsoft Exchange Server Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2022-29180: A vulnerability in which attackers could forge HTTP requests to manipulate the `charm` data directory to access or delete anything on the server. This has been patched and is available in release [v0.12.1](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/releases/tag/v0.12.1). We recommend that all users running self-hosted `charm` instances update immediately. This vulnerability was found in-house and we haven't been notified of any potential exploiters. ### Additional notes * Encrypted user data uploaded to the Charm server is safe as Charm servers cannot decrypt user data. This includes filenames, paths, and all key-value data. * Users running the official Charm [Docker images](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/blob/main/docker.md) are at minimal risk because the exploit is limited to the containerized filesystem.\n\n- CVE-2022-29847: In Progress Ipswitch WhatsUp Gold 21.0.0 through 21.1.1, and 22.0.0, it is possible for an unauthenticated attacker to invoke an API transaction that would allow them to relay encrypted WhatsUp Gold user credentials to an arbitrary host.\n\n- CVE-2022-39055: RAVA certificate validation system has inadequate filtering for URL parameter. An unauthenticated remote attacker can perform SSRF attack to discover internal network topology base on query response.\n\n- CVE-2022-36997: An issue was discovered in Veritas NetBackup 8.1.x through 8.1.2, 8.2, 8.3.x through 8.3.0.2, 9.x through 9.0.0.1, and 9.1.x through 9.1.0.1 (and related NetBackup products). An attacker with authenticated access to a NetBackup Client could remotely trigger impacts that include arbitrary file read, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), and denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2022-0528: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in GitHub repository transloadit/uppy prior to 3.3.1. \n\n- CVE-2022-1815: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor in GitHub repository jgraph/drawio prior to 18.1.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-20325: Missing fixes for CVE-2021-40438 and CVE-2021-26691 in the versions of httpd, as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.5.0, causes a security regression compared to the versions shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4. A user who installs or updates to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.5.0 would be vulnerable to the mentioned CVEs, even if they were properly fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4. CVE-2021-20325 was assigned to that Red Hat specific security regression and it does not affect the upstream versions of httpd.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-441 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-610 (ChildOf)",

          "extended_description": "\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.",

By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\" to access unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.\n\n\n### Alternative Terms\nDirectory traversal\nPath traversal: \"Path traversal\" is preferred over \"directory traversal,\" but both terms are attack-focused.\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-706\nChildOf -> CWE-668\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Other]** In many programming languages, the injection of a null byte (the 0 or NUL) may allow an attacker to truncate a generated filename to apply to a wider range of files. For example, the product may add \".txt\" to any pathname, thus limiting the attacker to text files, but a null injection may effectively remove this restriction.\n\n**[Relationship]** Pathname equivalence can be regarded as a type of canonicalization error.\n\n**[Relationship]** Some pathname equivalence issues are not directly related to directory traversal, rather are used to bypass security-relevant checks for whether a file/directory can be accessed by the attacker (e.g. a trailing \"/\" on a filename could bypass access rules that don't expect a trailing /, causing a server to provide the file when it normally would not).\n\n**[Terminology]** \n\nLike other weaknesses, terminology is often based on the types of manipulations used, instead of the underlying weaknesses. Some people use \"directory traversal\" only to refer to the injection of \"..\" and equivalent sequences whose specific meaning is to traverse directories.\n\n\nOther variants like \"absolute pathname\" and \"drive letter\" have the *effect* of directory traversal, but some people may not call it such, since it doesn't involve \"..\" or equivalent.\n\n\n**[Research Gap]** Many variants of path traversal attacks are probably under-studied with respect to root cause. CWE-790 and CWE-182 begin to cover part of this gap.\n\n**[Research Gap]** \n\nIncomplete diagnosis or reporting of vulnerabilities can make it difficult to know which variant is affected. For example, a researcher might say that \"..\\\" is vulnerable, but not test \"../\" which may also be vulnerable.\n\n\nAny combination of directory separators (\"/\", \"\\\", etc.) and numbers of \".\" (e.g. \"....\") can produce unique variants; for example, the \"//../\" variant is not listed (CVE-2004-0325). See this entry's children and lower-level descendants.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2024-37032:** Large language model (LLM) management tool does not validate the format of a digest value (CWE-1287) from a private, untrusted model registry, enabling relative path traversal (CWE-23), a.k.a.

An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.\n\t\t2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.\n```\nFor example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nNone\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-642\nChildOf -> CWE-610\nChildOf -> CWE-20\nCanPrecede -> CWE-22\nCanPrecede -> CWE-41\nCanPrecede -> CWE-98\nCanPrecede -> CWE-434\nCanPrecede -> CWE-59\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Maintenance]** CWE-114 is a Class, but it is listed a child of CWE-73 in view 1000. This suggests some abstraction problems that should be resolved in future versions.\n\n**[Relationship]** \n\nThe external control of filenames can be the primary link in chains with other file-related weaknesses, as seen in the CanPrecede relationships. This is because software systems use files for many different purposes: to execute programs, load code libraries, to store application data, to store configuration settings, record temporary data, act as signals or semaphores to other processes, etc.\n\n\nHowever, those weaknesses do not always require external control. For example, link-following weaknesses (CWE-59) often involve pathnames that are not controllable by the attacker at all.\n\n\nThe external control can be resultant from other issues. For example, in PHP applications, the register_globals setting can allow an attacker to modify variables that the programmer thought were immutable, enabling file inclusion (CWE-98) and path traversal (CWE-22). Operating with excessive privileges (CWE-250) might allow an attacker to specify an input filename that is not directly readable by the attacker, but is accessible to the privileged program. A buffer overflow (CWE-119) might give an attacker control over nearby memory locations that are related to pathnames, but were not directly modifiable by the attacker.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2022-45918:** Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n- **CVE-2008-5748:** Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.\n- **CVE-2008-5764:** Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\ninsecure temporary file: Some people use the phrase \"insecure temporary file\" when referring to a link following weakness, but other weaknesses can produce insecure temporary files without any symlink involvement at all.\nZip Slip: \"Zip slip\" is an attack that uses file archives (e.g., ZIP, tar, rar, etc.) that contain filenames with path traversal sequences that cause the files to be written outside of the directory under which the archive is expected to be extracted [REF-1282].

They are the combination of multiple elements: file or directory permissions, filename predictability, race conditions, and in some cases, a design limitation in which there is no mechanism for performing atomic file creation operations.\n\n\nSome potential factors are race conditions, permissions, and predictability.\n\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-1999-1386:** Some versions of Perl follow symbolic links when running with the -e option, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.\n- **CVE-2000-1178:** Text editor follows symbolic links when creating a rescue copy during an abnormal exit, which allows local users to overwrite the files of other users.\n- **CVE-2004-0217:** Antivirus update allows local users to create or append to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a logfile.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-24: Path Traversal: '../filedir'\n**Abstraction:** Variant\n**Status:** Incomplete\n\n### Description\nThe product uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize \"../\" sequences that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.\n\n### Extended Description\n\n\nThis allows attackers to traverse the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory.\n\n\nThe \"../\" manipulation is the canonical manipulation for operating systems that use \"/\" as directory separators, such as UNIX- and Linux-based systems.

Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.\n\n### Alternative Terms\nShell injection\nShell metacharacters\nOS Command Injection\n\n### Relationships\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-74\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nChildOf -> CWE-77\nCanAlsoBe -> CWE-88\n\n### Mapping Guidance\n**Usage:** Allowed\n**Rationale:** This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n**Comments:** Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred level of abstraction.\n**Reasons:**\n- Acceptable-Use\n\n\n### Additional Notes\n**[Terminology]** The \"OS command injection\" phrase carries different meanings to different people. For some people, it only refers to cases in which the attacker injects command separators into arguments for an application-controlled program that is being invoked. For some people, it refers to any type of attack that can allow the attacker to execute OS commands of their own choosing. This usage could include untrusted search path weaknesses (CWE-426) that cause the application to find and execute an attacker-controlled program. Further complicating the issue is the case when argument injection (CWE-88) allows alternate command-line switches or options to be inserted into the command line, such as an \"-exec\" switch whose purpose may be to execute the subsequent argument as a command (this -exec switch exists in the UNIX \"find\" command, for example). In this latter case, however, CWE-88 could be regarded as the primary weakness in a chain with CWE-78.\n\n**[Research Gap]** More investigation is needed into the distinction between the OS command injection variants, including the role with argument injection (CWE-88). Equivalent distinctions may exist in other injection-related problems such as SQL injection.\n\n\n\n### Observed Examples\n- **CVE-2020-10987:** OS command injection in Wi-Fi router, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-10221:** Template functionality in network configuration management tool allows OS command injection, as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n- **CVE-2020-9054:** Chain: improper input validation (CWE-20) in username parameter, leading to OS command injection (CWE-78), as exploited in the wild per CISA KEV.\n\n\n\n\n## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type\n**Abstraction:** Base\n**Status:** Draft\n\n### Description\nThe product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.\n\n### Extended Description\nNot provided\n\n### Alternative Terms\nUnrestricted File Upload: Used in vulnerability databases and elsewhere, but it is insufficiently precise.

These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by using the web-based management interface to upload a file to location on an affected device that they should not have access to. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite files on the file system of the affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-1297: Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV160, RV160W, RV260, RV260P, and RV260W VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct directory traversal attacks and overwrite certain files that should be restricted on an affected system. These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by using the web-based management interface to upload a file to location on an affected device that they should not have access to. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite files on the file system of the affected device.\n\n- CVE-2021-21586: Wyse Management Suite versions 3.2 and earlier contain an absolute path traversal vulnerability. A remote authenticated malicious user could exploit this vulnerability in order to read arbitrary files on the system.\n\n- CVE-2021-32507: Absolute Path Traversal vulnerability in FileDownload in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote authenticated attackers download arbitrary files via the Url path parameter. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-38146: The File Download API in Wipro Holmes Orchestrator 20.4.1 (20.4.1_02_11_2020) allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via absolute path traversal in the SearchString JSON field in /home/download POST data.\n\n- CVE-2021-3426: There's a flaw in Python 3's pydoc. A local or adjacent attacker who discovers or is able to convince another local or adjacent user to start a pydoc server could access the server and use it to disclose sensitive information belonging to the other user that they would not normally be able to access. The highest risk of this flaw is to data confidentiality. This flaw affects Python versions before 3.8.9, Python versions before 3.9.3 and Python versions before 3.10.0a7.\n\n- CVE-2020-35580: A local file inclusion vulnerability in the FileServlet in all SearchBlox before 9.2.2 allows remote, unauthenticated users to read arbitrary files from the operating system via a /searchblox/servlet/FileServlet?col=url= request. Additionally, this may be used to read the contents of the SearchBlox configuration file (e.g., searchblox/WEB-INF/config.xml), which contains both the Super Admin's API key and the base64 encoded SHA1 password hashes of other SearchBlox users.\n\n- CVE-2020-25359: An arbitrary file deletion vulnerability in rConfig 3.9.5 has been fixed for 3.9.6. This vulnerability gave attackers the ability to send a crafted request to /lib/ajaxHandlers/ajaxDeleteAllLoggingFiles.php by specifying a path in the path parameter and an extension in the ext parameter and delete all the files with that extension in that path.\n\n- CVE-2021-3709: Function check_attachment_for_errors() in file data/general-hooks/ubuntu.py could be tricked into exposing private data via a constructed crash file. This issue affects: apport 2.14.1 versions prior to 2.14.1-0ubuntu3.29+esm8; 2.20.1 versions prior to 2.20.1-0ubuntu2.30+esm2; 2.20.9 versions prior to 2.20.9-0ubuntu7.26; 2.20.11 versions prior to 2.20.11-0ubuntu27.20; 2.20.11 versions prior to 2.20.11-0ubuntu65.3;\n\n- CVE-2021-29006: rConfig 3.9.6 is affected by a Local File Disclosure vulnerability.

Such sensitive information as hashed credentials, hardcoded plaintext passwords for other services, configuration files, and private keys can be disclosed in this fashion. Improper handling of filenames that identify virtual resources, such as \"/dev/urandom\" allows an attacker to effect a denial of service attack against the command line interfaces of the Quagga services (zebra and ripd).\n\n- CVE-2021-20134: Quagga Services on D-Link DIR-2640 less than or equal to version 1.11B02 are affected by an absolute path traversal vulnerability that allows a remote, authenticated attacker to set an arbitrary file on the router's filesystem as the log file used by either Quagga service (zebra or ripd). Subsequent log messages will be appended to the file, prefixed by a timestamp and some logging metadata. Remote code execution can be achieved by using this vulnerability to append to a shell script on the router's filesystem, and then awaiting or triggering the execution of that script. A remote, unauthenticated root shell can easily be obtained on the device in this fashion.\n\n- CVE-2021-30497: Ivanti Avalanche (Premise) 6.3.2 allows remote unauthenticated users to read arbitrary files via Absolute Path Traversal. The imageFilePath parameter processed by the /AvalancheWeb/image endpoint is not verified to be within the scope of the image folder, e.g., the attacker can obtain sensitive information via the C:/Windows/system32/config/system.sav value.\n\n- CVE-2020-8195: Improper input validation in Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway versions before 13.0-58.30, 12.1-57.18, 12.0-63.21, 11.1-64.14 and 10.5-70.18 and Citrix SDWAN WAN-OP versions before 11.1.1a, 11.0.3d and 10.2.7 resulting in limited information disclosure to low privileged users.\n\n- CVE-2020-14864: Vulnerability in the Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Fusion Middleware (component: Installation).

An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem.\n\t\t2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.\n```\nFor example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-45918: Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n\n- CVE-2008-5748: Chain: external control of values for user's desired language and theme enables path traversal.\n\n- CVE-2008-5764: Chain: external control of user's target language enables remote file inclusion.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2020-19155: Improper Access Control in Jfinal CMS v4.7.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information and/or execute arbitrary code via the 'FileManager.rename()' function in the component 'modules/filemanager/FileManagerController.java'.\n\n- CVE-2021-40639: Improper access control in Jfinal CMS 5.1.0 allows attackers to access sensitive information via /classes/conf/db.properties&config=filemanager.config.js.\n\n- CVE-2021-27236: An issue was discovered in Mutare Voice (EVM) 3.x before 3.3.8. getfile.asp allows Unauthenticated Local File Inclusion, which can be leveraged to achieve Remote Code Execution.\n\n- CVE-2021-22539: An attacker can place a crafted JSON config file into the project folder pointing to a custom executable. VScode-bazel allows the workspace path to lint *.bzl files to be set via this config file. As such the attacker is able to execute any executable on the system through vscode-bazel. We recommend upgrading to version 0.4.1 or above.\n\n- CVE-2021-22009: The vCenter Server contains multiple denial-of-service vulnerabilities in VAPI (vCenter API) service. A malicious actor with network access to port 443 on vCenter Server may exploit these issues to create a denial of service condition due to excessive memory consumption by VAPI service.\n\n- CVE-2021-34539: An issue was discovered in CubeCoders AMP before 2.1.1.8. A lack of validation of the Java Version setting means that an unintended executable path can be set. The result is that high-privileged users can trigger code execution.\n\n- CVE-2021-43893: Windows Encrypting File System (EFS) Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\n- CVE-2021-43066: A external control of file name or path in Fortinet FortiClientWindows version 7.0.2 and below, version 6.4.6 and below, version 6.2.9 and below, version 6.0.10 and below allows attacker to escalate privilege via the MSI installer.\n\n- CVE-2022-24900: Piano LED Visualizer is software that allows LED lights to light up as a person plays a piano connected to a computer. Version 1.3 and prior are vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The `os.path.join` call is unsafe for use with untrusted input. When the `os.path.join` call encounters an absolute path, it ignores all the parameters it has encountered till that point and starts working with the new absolute path. Since the \"malicious\" parameter represents an absolute path, the result of `os.path.join` ignores the static directory completely. Hence, untrusted input is passed via the `os.path.join` call to `flask.send_file` can lead to path traversal attacks. A patch with a fix is available on the `master` branch of the GitHub repository. This can also be fixed by preventing flow of untrusted data to the vulnerable `send_file` function. In case the application logic necessiates this behaviour, one can either use the `flask.safe_join` to join untrusted paths or replace `flask.send_file` calls with `flask.send_from_directory` calls.\n\n- CVE-2022-34765: A CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path vulnerability exists that could cause loading of unauthorized firmware images when user-controlled data is written to the file path. Affected Products: X80 advanced RTU Communication Module (BMENOR2200H) (V2.01 and later), OPC UA Modicon Communication Module (BMENUA0100) (V1.10 and prior)\n\n- CVE-2022-39952: A external control of file name or path in Fortinet FortiNAC versions 9.4.0, 9.2.0 through 9.2.5, 9.1.0 through 9.1.7, 8.8.0 through 8.8.11, 8.7.0 through 8.7.6, 8.6.0 through 8.6.5, 8.5.0 through 8.5.4, 8.3.7 may allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands via specifically crafted HTTP request.\n\n- CVE-2022-45918: ILIAS before 7.16 allows External Control of File Name or Path.\n\n- CVE-2022-23118: Jenkins Debian Package Builder Plugin 1.6.11 and earlier implements functionality that allows agents to invoke command-line `git` at an attacker-specified path on the controller, allowing attackers able to control agent processes to invoke arbitrary OS commands on the controller.\n\n- CVE-2022-25643: seatd-launch in seatd 0.6.x before 0.6.4 allows removing files with escalated privileges when installed setuid root.

NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-11736.\n\n- CVE-2021-21272: ORAS is open source software which enables a way to push OCI Artifacts to OCI Conformant registries. ORAS is both a CLI for initial testing and a Go Module. In ORAS from version 0.4.0 and before version 0.9.0, there is a \"zip-slip\" vulnerability. The directory support feature allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links and hard links. A well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who runs `oras pull`. Users of the affected versions are impacted if they are `oras` CLI users who runs `oras pull`, or if they are Go programs, which invoke `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`. The problem has been fixed in version 0.9.0. For `oras` CLI users, there is no workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider. For `oras` package users, the workaround is to not use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`, and use other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider.\n\n- CVE-2021-28650: autoar-extractor.c in GNOME gnome-autoar before 0.3.1, as used by GNOME Shell, Nautilus, and other software, allows Directory Traversal during extraction because it lacks a check of whether a file's parent is a symlink in certain complex situations. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-36241.\n\n- CVE-2021-32518: A vulnerability in share_link in QSAN Storage Manager allows remote attackers to create a symbolic link then access arbitrary files. The referred vulnerability has been solved with the updated version of QSAN Storage Manager v3.3.3.\n\n- CVE-2021-32803: The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.4.15, and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via insufficient symlink protection. `node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-32825: bblfshd is an open source self-hosted server for source code parsing. In bblfshd before commit 4265465b9b6fb5663c30ee43806126012066aad4 there is a \"zipslip\" vulnerability. The unsafe handling of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may enable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations outside the designated target folder. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive file. Additionally, if the attacker has read access to the unpacked files, he may be able to read arbitrary system files the parent process has permissions to read. For more details including a PoC see the referenced GHSL-2020-258.\n\n- CVE-2021-36286: Dell SupportAssist Client Consumer versions 3.9.13.0 and any versions prior to 3.9.13.0 contain an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability that can be exploited by using the Windows feature of NTFS called Symbolic links. Symbolic links can be created by any(non-privileged) user under some object directories, but by themselves are not sufficient to successfully escalate privileges. However, combining them with a different object, such as the NTFS junction point allows for the exploitation. Support assist clean files functionality do not distinguish junction points from the physical folder and proceeds to clean the target of the junction that allows nonprivileged users to create junction points and delete arbitrary files on the system which can be accessed only by the admin.\n\n- CVE-2021-38511: An issue was discovered in the tar crate before 0.4.36 for Rust. When symlinks are present in a TAR archive, extraction can create arbitrary directories via .. traversal.\n\n- CVE-2021-29136: Open Container Initiative umoci before 0.4.7 allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary host paths via a crafted image that causes symlink traversal when \"umoci unpack\" or \"umoci raw unpack\" is used.\n\n- CVE-2020-27833: A Zip Slip vulnerability was found in the oc binary in openshift-clients where an arbitrary file write is achieved by using a specially crafted raw container image (.tar file) which contains symbolic links. The vulnerability is limited to the command `oc image extract`. If a symbolic link is first created pointing within the tarball, this allows further symbolic links to bypass the existing path check. This flaw allows the tarball to create links outside the tarball's parent directory, allowing for executables or configuration files to be overwritten, resulting in arbitrary code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. Versions up to and including openshift-clients-4.7.0-202104250659.p0.git.95881af are affected.\n\n- CVE-2020-27697: Trend Micro Security 2020 (Consumer) contains a vulnerability in the installer package that could be exploited by placing a malicious DLL in a non-protected location with high privileges (symlink attack) which can lead to obtaining administrative privileges during the installation of the product.\n\n- CVE-2020-4717: A vulnerability exists in IBM SPSS Modeler Subscription Installer that allows a user with create symbolic link permission to write arbitrary file in another protected path during product installation.

These exposures can be inadvertent (bug) or intentional (design).\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2002-2094: This, and others, use \"..\" attacks and monitor error responses, so there is overlap with directory traversal.\n\n- CVE-2001-1483: Enumeration of valid usernames based on inconsistent responses\n\n- CVE-2001-1528: Account number enumeration via inconsistent responses.\n\n- CVE-2004-2150: User enumeration via discrepancies in error messages.\n\n- CVE-2005-1650: User enumeration via discrepancies in error messages.\n\n- CVE-2004-0294: Bulletin Board displays different error messages when a user exists or not, which makes it easier for remote attackers to identify valid users and conduct a brute force password guessing attack.\n\n- CVE-2004-0243: Operating System, when direct remote login is disabled, displays a different message if the password is correct, which allows remote attackers to guess the password via brute force methods.\n\n- CVE-2002-0514: Product allows remote attackers to determine if a port is being filtered because the response packet TTL is different than the default TTL.\n\n- CVE-2002-0515: Product sets a different TTL when a port is being filtered than when it is not being filtered, which allows remote attackers to identify filtered ports by comparing TTLs.\n\n- CVE-2001-1387: Product may generate different responses than specified by the administrator, possibly leading to an information leak.\n\n- CVE-2004-0778: Version control system allows remote attackers to determine the existence of arbitrary files and directories via the -X command for an alternate history file, which causes different error messages to be returned.\n\n- CVE-2004-1428: FTP server generates an error message if the user name does not exist instead of prompting for a password, which allows remote attackers to determine valid usernames.\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2021-0086: Observable response discrepancy in floating-point operations for some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-0089: Observable response discrepancy in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.\n\n- CVE-2021-20376: IBM Sterling File Gateway 2.2.0.0 through 6.1.1.0 could allow an authenticated attacker to enumerate usernames due to there being an observable discrepancy in returned messages. IBM X-Force ID: 195568.\n\n- CVE-2021-37151: CyberArk Identity 21.5.131, when handling an invalid authentication attempt, sometimes reveals whether the username is valid. In certain authentication policy configurations with MFA, the API response length can be used to differentiate between a valid user and an invalid one (aka Username Enumeration). Response differentiation enables attackers to enumerate usernames of valid application users. Attackers can use this information to leverage brute-force and dictionary attacks in order to discover valid account information such as passwords.\n\n- CVE-2021-37968: Inappropriate implementation in Background Fetch API in Google Chrome prior to 94.0.4606.54 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2020-35518: When binding against a DN during authentication, the reply from 389-ds-base will be different whether the DN exists or not. This can be used by an unauthenticated attacker to check the existence of an entry in the LDAP database.\n\n- CVE-2021-27583: In Directus 8.x through 8.8.1, an attacker can discover whether a user is present in the database through the password reset feature. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer\n\n- CVE-2021-22892: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Rocket.Chat server fixed v3.13, v3.12.2 & v3.11.3 that allowed email addresses to be disclosed by enumeration and validation checks.\n\n- CVE-2021-44848: In Cibele Thinfinity VirtualUI before 3.0, /changePassword returns different responses for invalid authentication requests depending on whether the username exists.\n\n- CVE-2021-20049: A vulnerability in SonicWall SMA100 password change API allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to perform SMA100 username enumeration based on the server responses. This vulnerability impacts 10.2.1.2-24sv, 10.2.0.8-37sv and earlier 10.x versions.\n\n- CVE-2022-24784: Statamic is a Laravel and Git powered CMS. Before versions 3.2.39 and 3.3.2, it is possible to confirm a single character of a user's password hash using a specially crafted regular expression filter in the users endpoint of the REST API. Multiple such requests can eventually uncover the entire hash. The hash is not present in the response, however the presence or absence of a result confirms if the character is in the right position. The API has throttling enabled by default, making this a time intensive task. Both the REST API and the users endpoint need to be enabled, as they are disabled by default. The issue has been fixed in versions 3.2.39 and above, and 3.3.2 and above.\n\n- CVE-2021-20147: ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus below build 6116 contains an observable response discrepancy in the UMCP operation of the ChangePasswordAPI. This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to determine whether a Windows domain user exists.\n\n- CVE-2021-38009: Inappropriate implementation in cache in Google Chrome prior to 96.0.4664.45 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-1139: Inappropriate implementation in Background Fetch API in Google Chrome prior to 100.0.4896.60 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page.\n\n- CVE-2022-27814: SWHKD 1.1.5 allows arbitrary file-existence tests via the -c option.\n\n- CVE-2022-47952: lxc-user-nic in lxc through 5.0.1 is installed setuid root, and may allow local users to infer whether any file exists, even within a protected directory tree, because \"Failed to open\" often indicates that a file does not exist, whereas \"does not refer to a network namespace path\" often indicates that a file exists. NOTE: this is different from CVE-2018-6556 because the CVE-2018-6556 fix design was based on the premise that \"we will report back to the user that the open() failed but the user has no way of knowing why it failed\"; however, in many realistic cases, there are no plausible reasons for failing except that the file does not exist.\n\n- CVE-2022-24032: Adenza AxiomSL ControllerView through 10.8.1 is vulnerable to user enumeration. An attacker can identify valid usernames on the platform because a failed login attempt produces a different error message when the username is valid.\n\n- CVE-2022-0569: Observable Discrepancy in Packagist snipe/snipe-it prior to v5.3.9. \n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-203 (ChildOf)",

In some cases, it is useful for bypassing protection schemes in environments for which \"/\" is supported but not the primary separator, such as Windows, which uses \"\\\" but can also accept \"/\".\n\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-45918: Chain: a learning management tool debugger uses external input to locate previous session logs (CWE-73) and does not properly validate the given path (CWE-20), allowing for filesystem path traversal using \"../\" sequences (CWE-24)\n\nTop 25 CWE Examples:\n\n- CVE-2022-47945: ThinkPHP Framework before 6.0.14 allows local file inclusion via the lang parameter when the language pack feature is enabled (lang_switch_on=true). An unauthenticated and remote attacker can exploit this to execute arbitrary operating system commands, as demonstrated by including pearcmd.php.\n\n- CVE-2022-2945: The WordPress Infinite Scroll \u2013 Ajax Load More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in versions up to, and including, 5.5.3 via the 'type' parameter found in the alm_get_layout() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrative permissions, to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information.\n\n- CVE-2022-36065: GrowthBook is an open-source platform for feature flagging and A/B testing. With some self-hosted configurations in versions prior to 2022-08-29, attackers can register new accounts and upload files to arbitrary directories within the container. If the attacker uploads a Python script to the right location, they can execute arbitrary code within the container. To be affected, ALL of the following must be true: Self-hosted deployment (GrowthBook Cloud is unaffected); using local file uploads (as opposed to S3 or Google Cloud Storage); NODE_ENV set to a non-production value and JWT_SECRET set to an easily guessable string like `dev`. This issue is patched in commit 1a5edff8786d141161bf880c2fd9ccbe2850a264 (2022-08-29). As a workaround, set `JWT_SECRET` environment variable to a long random string. This will stop arbitrary file uploads, but the only way to stop attackers from registering accounts is by updating to the latest build.\n\n- CVE-2022-3060: Improper control of a resource identifier in Error Tracking in GitLab CE/EE affecting all versions from 12.7 allows an authenticated attacker to generate content which could cause a victim to make unintended arbitrary requests\n\n- CVE-2022-32409: A local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in the component codemirror.php of Portal do Software Publico Brasileiro i3geo v7.0.5 allows attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a crafted HTTP request.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-23 (ChildOf)",

Because of not checking authorization in ids parameter in files-edit.php and id parameter in process.php function, a user with uploader role can download and edit all files of users in application.\n\n- CVE-2021-41554: ARCHIBUS Web Central 21.3.3.815 (a version from 2014) does not properly validate requests for access to data and functionality in these affected endpoints: /archibus/schema/ab-edit-users.axvw, /archibus/schema/ab-data-dictionary-table.axvw, /archibus/schema/ab-schema-add-field.axvw, /archibus/schema/ab-core/views/process-navigator/ab-my-user-profile.axvw. By not verifying the permissions for access to resources, it allows a potential attacker to view pages that are not allowed. Specifically, it was found that any authenticated user can reach the administrative console for user management by directly requesting access to the page via URL. This allows a malicious user to modify all users' profiles, to elevate any privileges to administrative ones, or to create or delete any type of user. It is also possible to modify the emails of other users, through a misconfiguration of the username parameter, on the user profile page. This is fixed in all recent versions, such as version 26. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. Version 21.3 was officially de-supported by the end of 2020\n\n- CVE-2021-1506: Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or gain access to sensitive information, or allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain escalated privileges or gain unauthorized access to the application.

Refer to the referenced GitHub Security Advisory for complete details. This is fixed in version 0.7.5.\n\n- CVE-2021-32748: Nextcloud Richdocuments in an open source self hosted online office. Nextcloud uses the WOPI (\"Web Application Open Platform Interface\") protocol to communicate with the Collabora Editor, the communication between these two services was not protected by a credentials or IP check. Whilst this does not result in gaining access to data that the user has not yet access to, it can result in a bypass of any enforced watermark on documents as described on the [Nextcloud Virtual Data Room](https://nextcloud.com/virtual-data-room/) website and [our documentation](https://portal.nextcloud.com/article/nextcloud-and-virtual-data-room-configuration-59.html). The Nextcloud Richdocuments releases 3.8.3 and 4.2.0 add an additional admin settings for an allowlist of IP addresses that can access the WOPI API. We recommend upgrading and configuring the allowlist to a list of Collabora servers. There is no known workaround. Note that this primarily results a bypass of any configured watermark or download protection using File Access Control. If you do not require or rely on these as a security feature no immediate action is required on your end.\n\n- CVE-2021-3653: A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the \"int_ctl\" field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.14-rc7.\n\n- CVE-2021-25409: Improper access in Notification setting prior to SMR JUN-2021 Release 1 allows physically proximate attackers to set arbitrary notification via physically configuring device.\n\n- CVE-2021-24851: The Insert Pages WordPress plugin before 3.7.0 allows users with a role as low as Contributor to access content and metadata from arbitrary posts/pages regardless of their author and status (ie private), using a shortcode.

In some circumstances, a potential Remote Code Execution vulnerability existed on sites that did not restrict administrative changes (if an attacker were somehow able to hijack an administrator's session).\n\n- CVE-2021-35413: A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in course_intro_pdf_import.php of Chamilo LMS v1.11.x allows authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted .htaccess file.\n\n- CVE-2021-21382: Restund is an open source NAT traversal server. The restund TURN server can be instructed to open a relay to the loopback address range. This allows you to reach any other service running on localhost which you might consider private. In the configuration that we ship (https://github.com/wireapp/ansible-restund/blob/master/templates/restund.conf.j2#L40-L43) the `status` interface of restund is enabled and is listening on `127.0.0.1`.The `status` interface allows users to issue administrative commands to `restund` like listing open relays or draining connections. It would be possible for an attacker to contact the status interface and issue administrative commands by setting `XOR-PEER-ADDRESS` to `127.0.0.1:{{restund_udp_status_port}}` when opening a TURN channel. We now explicitly disallow relaying to loopback addresses, 'any' addresses, link local addresses, and the broadcast address. As a workaround disable the `status` module in your restund configuration. However there might still be other services running on `127.0.0.0/8` that you do not want to have exposed. The `turn` module can be disabled. Restund will still perform STUN and this might already be enough for initiating calls in your environments. TURN is only used as a last resort when other NAT traversal options do not work. One should also make sure that the TURN server is set up with firewall rules so that it cannot relay to other addresses that you don't want the TURN server to relay to. For example other services in the same VPC where the TURN server is running. Ideally TURN servers should be deployed in an isolated fashion where they can only reach what they need to reach to perform their task of assisting NAT-traversal.\n\n- CVE-2021-36917: WordPress Hide My WP plugin (versions <= 6.2.3) can be deactivated by any unauthenticated user. It is possible to retrieve a reset token which can then be used to deactivate the plugin.\n\n- CVE-2021-39184: Electron is a framework for writing cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. A vulnerability in versions prior to 11.5.0, 12.1.0, and 13.3.0 allows a sandboxed renderer to request a \"thumbnail\" image of an arbitrary file on the user's system. The thumbnail can potentially include significant parts of the original file, including textual data in many cases. Versions 15.0.0-alpha.10, 14.0.0, 13.3.0, 12.1.0, and 11.5.0 all contain a fix for the vulnerability. Two workarounds aside from upgrading are available. One may make the vulnerability significantly more difficult for an attacker to exploit by enabling `contextIsolation` in one's app. One may also disable the functionality of the `createThumbnailFromPath` API if one does not need it.\n\n- CVE-2021-39231: In Apache Ozone versions prior to 1.2.0, Various internal server-to-server RPC endpoints are available for connections, making it possible for an attacker to download raw data from Datanode and Ozone manager and modify Ratis replication configuration.\n\n- CVE-2021-29958: When a download was initiated, the client did not check whether it was in normal or private browsing mode, which led to private mode cookies being shared in normal browsing mode.

All unpatched versions of Argo CD starting with 1.0.0 are vulnerable to an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious user to potentially escalate their privileges to admin-level. Versions starting with 0.8.0 and 0.5.0 contain limited versions of this issue. To perform exploits, an authorized Argo CD user must have push access to an Application's source git or Helm repository or `sync` and `override` access to an Application. Once a user has that access, different exploitation levels are possible depending on their other RBAC privileges. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.2, 2.2.8, and 2.1.14. Some mitigation measures are available but do not serve as a substitute for upgrading. To avoid privilege escalation, limit who has push access to Application source repositories or `sync` + `override` access to Applications; and limit which repositories are available in projects where users have `update` access to Applications. To avoid unauthorized resource inspection/tampering, limit who has `delete`, `get`, or `action` access to Applications.\n\n- CVE-2022-28866: Multiple Improper Access Control was discovered in Nokia AirFrame BMC Web GUI < R18 Firmware v4.13.00.

Sourcegraph prior to version 3.37 is vulnerable to remote code execution in the `gitserver` service. The service acts as a git exec proxy, and fails to properly restrict calling `git config`. This allows an attacker to set the git `core.sshCommand` option, which sets git to use the specified command instead of ssh when they need to connect to a remote system. Exploitation of this vulnerability depends on how Sourcegraph is deployed. An attacker able to make HTTP requests to internal services like gitserver is able to exploit it. This issue is patched in Sourcegraph version 3.37. As a workaround, ensure that requests to gitserver are properly protected.\n\n- CVE-2022-4223: The pgAdmin server includes an HTTP API that is intended to be used to validate the path a user selects to external PostgreSQL utilities such as pg_dump and pg_restore. The utility is executed by the server to determine what PostgreSQL version it is from. Versions of pgAdmin prior to 6.17 failed to properly secure this API, which could allow an unauthenticated user to call it with a path of their choosing, such as a UNC path to a server they control on a Windows machine. This would cause an appropriately named executable in the target path to be executed by the pgAdmin server.\n\n- CVE-2022-41417: BlogEngine.NET v3.3.8.0 allows an attacker to create any folder with \"files\" prefix under ~/App_Data/.\n\n- CVE-2022-0287: The myCred WordPress plugin before 2.4.4.1 does not have any authorisation in place in its mycred-tools-select-user AJAX action, allowing any authenticated user, such as subscriber to call and retrieve all email addresses from the blog\n\n- CVE-2022-0588: Missing Authorization in Packagist librenms/librenms prior to 22.2.0. \n\n- CVE-2022-31095: discourse-chat is a chat plugin for the Discourse application.

There are no known workarounds for this issue, and users are advised to update the plugin.\n\n- CVE-2022-32220: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat <v5 due to the getUserMentionsByChannel meteor server method discloses messages from private channels and direct messages regardless of the users access permission to the room.\n\n- CVE-2022-35249: A information disclosure vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat <v5 where the getUserMentionsByChannel meteor server method discloses messages from private channels and direct messages regardless of the users access permission to the room.\n\n- CVE-2022-39222: Dex is an identity service that uses OpenID Connect to drive authentication for other apps. Dex instances with public clients (and by extension, clients accepting tokens issued by those Dex instances) are affected by this vulnerability if they are running a version prior to 2.35.0. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by making a victim navigate to a malicious website and guiding them through the OIDC flow, stealing the OAuth authorization code in the process. The authorization code then can be exchanged by the attacker for a token, gaining access to applications accepting that token. Version 2.35.0 has introduced a fix for this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n\n- CVE-2022-39289: ZoneMinder is a free, open source Closed-circuit television software application.

It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features that classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.\n\nReal-World Examples:\n\n- CVE-2024-5184: API service using a large generative AI model allows direct prompt injection to leak hard-coded system prompts or execute other prompts.\n\n- CVE-2022-36069: Python-based dependency management tool avoids OS command injection when generating Git commands but allows injection of optional arguments with input beginning with a dash (CWE-88), potentially allowing for code execution.\n\n- CVE-1999-0067: Canonical example of OS command injection.

The vulnerability arises due to unsafe usage of the logo_uri parameter in the Dynamic Client Registration request. An unauthenticated attacker can make a HTTP request from the vulnerable server to any address in the internal network and obtain its response (which might, for example, have a JavaScript payload for resultant XSS). The issue can be exploited to bypass network boundaries, obtain sensitive data, or attack other hosts in the internal network.\n\n- CVE-2021-27214: A Server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the ProductConfig servlet in Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus through 6013 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to perform blind HTTP requests or perform a Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against the administrative interface via an HTTP request, a different vulnerability than CVE-2019-3905.\n\n- CVE-2021-21287: MinIO is a High Performance Object Storage released under Apache License v2.0. In MinIO before version RELEASE.2021-01-30T00-20-58Z there is a server-side request forgery vulnerability. The target application may have functionality for importing data from a URL, publishing data to a URL, or otherwise reading data from a URL that can be tampered with. The attacker modifies the calls to this functionality by supplying a completely different URL or by manipulating how URLs are built (path traversal etc.). In a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, the attacker can abuse functionality on the server to read or update internal resources. The attacker can supply or modify a URL which the code running on the server will read or submit data, and by carefully selecting the URLs, the attacker may be able to read server configuration such as AWS metadata, connect to internal services like HTTP enabled databases, or perform post requests towards internal services which are not intended to be exposed. This is fixed in version RELEASE.2021-01-30T00-20-58Z, all users are advised to upgrade. As a workaround you can disable the browser front-end with \"MINIO_BROWSER=off\" environment variable.\n\n- CVE-2021-39303: The server in Jamf Pro before 10.32.0 has an SSRF vulnerability, aka PI-006352. NOTE: Jamf Nation will also publish an article about this vulnerability.\n\n- CVE-2021-40091: An SSRF issue was discovered in SquaredUp for SCOM 5.2.1.6654.\n\n- CVE-2021-43780: Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions 10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version 10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings > Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`. All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY `variables.\n\n- CVE-2021-27561: Yealink Device Management (DM) 3.6.0.20 allows command injection as root via the /sm/api/v1/firewall/zone/services URI, without authentication.\n\n- CVE-2021-29475: HedgeDoc (formerly known as CodiMD) is an open-source collaborative markdown editor. An attacker is able to receive arbitrary files from the file system when exporting a note to PDF. Since the code injection has to take place as note content, there fore this exploit requires the attackers ability to modify a note. This will affect all instances, which have pdf export enabled. This issue has been fixed by https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/c1789474020a6d668d616464cb2da5e90e123f65 and is available in version 1.5.0. Starting the CodiMD/HedgeDoc instance with `CMD_ALLOW_PDF_EXPORT=false` or set `\"allowPDFExport\": false` in config.json can mitigate this issue for those who cannot upgrade. This exploit works because while PhantomJS doesn't actually render the `file:///` references to the PDF file itself, it still uses them internally, and exfiltration is possible, and easy through JavaScript rendering. The impact is pretty bad, as the attacker is able to read the CodiMD/HedgeDoc `config.json` file as well any other files on the filesystem. Even though the suggested Docker deploy option doesn't have many interesting files itself, the `config.json` still often contains sensitive information, database credentials, and maybe OAuth secrets among other things.\n\n- CVE-2021-45968: An issue was discovered in xmppserver jar in the XMPP Server component of the JIve platform, as used in Pascom Cloud Phone System before 7.20.x (and in other products).

An attacker with authenticated access to a NetBackup Client could remotely trigger impacts that include arbitrary file read, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), and denial of service.\n\n- CVE-2022-0528: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in GitHub repository transloadit/uppy prior to 3.3.1. \n\n- CVE-2022-1815: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor in GitHub repository jgraph/drawio prior to 18.1.2.\n\n- CVE-2021-20325: Missing fixes for CVE-2021-40438 and CVE-2021-26691 in the versions of httpd, as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.5.0, causes a security regression compared to the versions shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4. A user who installs or updates to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.5.0 would be vulnerable to the mentioned CVEs, even if they were properly fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4. CVE-2021-20325 was assigned to that Red Hat specific security regression and it does not affect the upstream versions of httpd.\n\nRelated Weaknesses:\n\n- CWE-441 (ChildOf)\n\n- CWE-610 (ChildOf)",

          "extended_description": "\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.",
