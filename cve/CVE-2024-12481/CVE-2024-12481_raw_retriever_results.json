Affected by this vulnerability is the function findUser of the file wetech-cms-master\\wetech-core\\src\\main\\java\\tech\\wetech\\cms\\dao\\UserDao.java. The manipulation of the argument searchValue/gId/rId leads to sql injection. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
