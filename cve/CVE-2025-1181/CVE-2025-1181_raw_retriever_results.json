  "query": "A vulnerability classified as critical was found in GNU Binutils 2.43. This vulnerability affects the function _bfd_elf_gc_mark_rsec of the file bfd/elflink.c of the component ld. The manipulation leads to memory corruption. The attack can be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The name of the patch is 931494c9a89558acb36a03a340c01726545eef24. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.",
