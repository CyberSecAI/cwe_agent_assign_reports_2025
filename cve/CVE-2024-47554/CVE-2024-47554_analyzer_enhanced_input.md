## Vulnerability Description
Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in Apache Commons IO. The org.apache.commons.io.input.XmlStreamReader class may excessively consume CPU resources when processing maliciously crafted input. This issue affects Apache Commons IO from 2.0 before 2.14.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.14.0 or later, which fixes the issue.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **excessive CPU consumption**
- **impact:** Resource Consumption
- **vector:** maliciously crafted input
- **product:** Apache Commons IO
- **version:** from 2.0 before 2.14.0
- **component:** org.apache.commons.io.input.XmlStreamReader class

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-47554:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `org.apache.commons.io.input.XmlStreamReader` class within the Apache Commons IO library. It stems from uncontrolled resource consumption when processing maliciously crafted XML input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation or resource management within `XmlStreamReader` when parsing XML data. This allows specially crafted malicious XML to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, making the affected system or application unresponsive. The excessive resource consumption exhausts the CPU, preventing legitimate operations.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through providing malicious XML input to the `XmlStreamReader` class. This could happen if an application uses `XmlStreamReader` to process untrusted XML data, possibly from external sources or user-provided input.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to supply malicious XML data that will be processed by a vulnerable instance of `org.apache.commons.io.input.XmlStreamReader`. The attacker does not necessarily need access to the server, the attack may be triggered by providing input data to the application.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects versions of Apache Commons IO prior to 2.14.0.
- The issue was identified by CodeQL (tool).
- The suggested mitigation is to upgrade to Apache Commons IO version 2.14.0 or later.
