The retriever results also list CWE-787 as the top candidate. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms the **out-of-bounds write** as the root cause. Given this direct evidence, CWE-787 is selected as the primary CWE.\n\nThe other CWEs were considered, but were not selected because they are either too general (e.g., CWE-20 Improper Input Validation), related to integer issues (e.g., CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound), or describe the impact rather than the root cause.
