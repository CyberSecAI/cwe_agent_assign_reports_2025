## Vulnerability Description
Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. Jwt filter will lead to an Envoy crash when clear route cache with remote JWKs. In the following case 1. remote JWKs are used, which requires async header processing 2. clear_route_cache is enabled on the provider 3. header operations are enabled in JWT filter, e.g. header to claims feature 4. the routing table is configured in a way that the JWT header operations modify requests to not match any route. When these conditions are met, a crash is triggered in the upstream code due to **nullptr reference conversion** from route(). The root cause is the ordering of continueDecoding and clearRouteCache. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.31.2, 1.30.6, and 1.29.9. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **nullptr reference conversion**
- **impact:** crash
- **vector:** clear route cache with remote JWKs
- **product:** Envoy
- **version:** before 1.31.2, 1.30.6, and 1.29.9
- **component:** Jwt filter

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from an incorrect sequence of operations within the JWT filter of Envoy when `clear_route_cache` is enabled with remote JWKs, header operations, and specific routing table configurations. Specifically, the `continueDecoding` operation occurs before `clearRouteCache` which leads to a null pointer dereference when a cached route is cleared, and then the upstream request tries to use it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Incorrect Ordering:** The core weakness lies in the incorrect ordering of `continueDecoding` and `clearRouteCache` within the JWT filter's logic. This leads to a race condition where the route cache might be cleared before the upstream request completes.
*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** The cleared route is then accessed, resulting in a `nullptr` reference conversion when the upstream code attempts to use it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Envoy Crash:** The most significant impact is that Envoy crashes when the vulnerability is triggered, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, indicating that an attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely.
*   **Specific Configuration:** The attack requires a specific configuration of Envoy, including:
    *   Remote JWKs
    *   `clear_route_cache` enabled
    *   Header operations in the JWT filter
    *   Routing table configurations where JWT header operations can make requests not match any route.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Privileges Required:** An attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction Required:** User interaction is required, although it is not specified in detail what type of interaction is required.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests that would trigger the specified configuration in Envoy.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.3, which is considered Moderate.
*   The attack complexity is rated as High.
*   The scope is Unchanged, meaning the vulnerability does not impact resources outside of the Envoy process.
*   The vulnerability affects versions of Envoy prior to the patched versions: 1.31.2, 1.30.6, and 1.29.9.
*   The report indicates that the root cause is the ordering of `continueDecoding` and `clearRouteCache`.
