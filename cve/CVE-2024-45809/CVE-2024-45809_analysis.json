  "description": "Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. Jwt filter will lead to an Envoy crash when clear route cache with remote JWKs. In the following case 1. remote JWKs are used, which requires async header processing 2. clear_route_cache is enabled on the provider 3. header operations are enabled in JWT filter, e.g. header to claims feature 4. the routing table is configured in a way that the JWT header operations modify requests to not match any route. When these conditions are met, a crash is triggered in the upstream code due to **nullptr reference conversion** from route(). The root cause is the ordering of continueDecoding and clearRouteCache. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.31.2, 1.30.6, and 1.29.9. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from an incorrect sequence of operations within the JWT filter of Envoy when `clear_route_cache` is enabled with remote JWKs, header operations, and specific routing table configurations. Specifically, the `continueDecoding` operation occurs before `clearRouteCache` which leads to a null pointer dereference when a cached route is cleared, and then the upstream request tries to use it.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n*   **Incorrect Ordering:** The core weakness lies in the incorrect ordering of `continueDecoding` and `clearRouteCache` within the JWT filter's logic. This leads to a race condition where the route cache might be cleared before the upstream request completes.\n*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** The cleared route is then accessed, resulting in a `nullptr` reference conversion when the upstream code attempts to use it.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Envoy Crash:** The most significant impact is that Envoy crashes when the vulnerability is triggered, leading to a denial of service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, indicating that an attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely.\n*   **Specific Configuration:** The attack requires a specific configuration of Envoy, including:\n    *   Remote JWKs\n    *   `clear_route_cache` enabled\n    *   Header operations in the JWT filter\n    *   Routing table configurations where JWT header operations can make requests not match any route.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **No Privileges Required:** An attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.\n*   **User Interaction Required:** User interaction is required, although it is not specified in detail what type of interaction is required.\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests that would trigger the specified configuration in Envoy.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.3, which is considered Moderate.\n*   The attack complexity is rated as High.\n*   The scope is Unchanged, meaning the vulnerability does not impact resources outside of the Envoy process.\n*   The vulnerability affects versions of Envoy prior to the patched versions: 1.31.2, 1.30.6, and 1.29.9.\n*   The report indicates that the root cause is the ordering of `continueDecoding` and `clearRouteCache`.\n\nThis analysis provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description, outlining the specific conditions and root cause of the vulnerability.",

While **CWE-476** is the direct cause of the crash, the conditions leading to it suggest that **CWE-754** or **CWE-755** might also be relevant, as the incorrect ordering of operations could be seen as a failure to properly check for or handle an unusual condition. However, the evidence for these is weaker, making them secondary considerations.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe476[\"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference\"]\n    cwe754[\"CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    cwe755[\"CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n    \n    cwe476 <--|CANFOLLOW| cwe754\n    cwe476 <--|CANFOLLOW| cwe755\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe476 primary\n    class cwe754,cwe755 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect ordering** of `continueDecoding` and `clearRouteCache` operations. This **incorrect ordering** leads to a state where a cleared route is accessed, resulting in a **NULL pointer dereference** and subsequent crash. Thus the chain is:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Ordering** (Implicit weakness due to the vulnerability description, not a specific CWE)\n2.  CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference (Root Cause of the crash)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE identified is **CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference)**, as it directly represents the crash caused by accessing a null pointer. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions a \"**nullptr reference conversion**\" as the root cause. The evidence supports this classification. I also considered **CWE-754 (Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions)** and **CWE-755 (Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions)** since the vulnerability involves **incorrect ordering** of operations which are unusual conditions that the software should have checked for.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-476** is at the base level of abstraction and accurately reflects the direct cause of the crash. While other CWEs were considered, they represent contributing factors rather than the immediate cause.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* This CWE doesn't apply because the issue is not about specifying the destination, but about a null pointer dereference due to the **incorrect ordering** of operations.\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Used:* While similar to **CWE-476**, the root cause is not that the pointer was uninitialized, but that it was dereferenced after being nulled out due to the cache being cleared.\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
