This is commonly done via links in emails or malicious websites.\\n*   The attacker does not require any special privileges on the system, only a user with admin or higher privileges to click on the crafted link while logged into WordPress.\\n\\n**Additional Notes:**\\n*   The vulnerability is classified as having a \"low\" patch priority and is considered to have a \"low\" severity, although the CVSS score is 7.1 which would be considered High.\\n*   There is no official fix available for this vulnerability at the time of the report.\\n*   The vulnerability was reported by SOPROBRO.\\n*   The plugin falls under the OWASP Top 10 category \"A1: Broken Access Control\".', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [], 'total_samples_by_threshold': {}, 'top_cwes_by_threshold': {}}}, similarity_summary=SimilarityInsight(consensus_cwe='', top_cwes=[], confidence_levels={}, total_samples=0), analysis='', analysis_with_relationships='', criticism='', resolution='', relevant_cwes=[{'metadata': {'doc_id': '352', 'name': 'Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'weakness:XSS', 'keyphrase': 'XSS', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}, {'id': 'product:Karl Kiesinger Country Blocker', 'keyphrase': 'Karl Kiesinger Country Blocker', 'type': 'product'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 3.2', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 3.2', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(270.3254475407106)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '434', 'name': 'Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'rootcause:lack of CSRF protection', 'keyphrase': 'lack of CSRF protection', 'type': 'rootcause'}, {'id': 'version:n/a through 3.2', 'keyphrase': 'n/a through 3.2', 'type': 'version'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(199.14711894289871)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '80', 'name': 'Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.', 'keyphrase_sources': [{'id': 'weakness:cross-site scripting', 'keyphrase': 'cross-site scripting', 'type': 'weakness'}]}, 'similarity': np.float64(191.38338692006906)}, {'metadata': {'doc_id': '116', 'name': 'Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output', 'source': 'sparse', 'original_content': 'The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
