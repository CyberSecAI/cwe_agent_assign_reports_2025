The root cause of the vulnerability is **insufficient redaction of sensitive information**. |\n| CWE-525 | Use of Web Browser Cache Containing Sensitive Information | 0.60 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The vulnerability allows an app to read Safari's browsing history, which could be due to the browser cache containing sensitive information. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.70\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-212, which represents the **improper removal of sensitive information**. CWE-525 is related, as it describes the use of a web browser cache that contains sensitive information. While CWE-525 is more specific to browser caches, the root cause lies in the **failure to properly redact sensitive information** before it is stored or transferred, making CWE-212 the more appropriate primary CWE. Both CWEs are at preferred levels of abstraction (Base and Variant respectively).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe212[\"CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\"]\n    cwe525[\"CWE-525: Use of Web Browser Cache Containing Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe525 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe212 primary\n    class cwe525 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **insufficient redaction of sensitive information** (CWE-212). This leads to the exposure of sensitive data within Safari's browsing history. If the browsing history is stored in a browser cache (CWE-525), and the application has the ability to read this cache, then a malicious application can access this information.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-212 because the root cause is the **insufficient redaction of sensitive information**. The evidence for this is the vulnerability description and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section. The vulnerability allows an app to read Safari's browsing history, which could be due to the browser cache containing sensitive information (CWE-525).\n\nThe retriever results included CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write), CWE-843 (Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')), and CWE-347 (Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature). These were not chosen because they do not directly relate to the **redaction of sensitive information** or the specific issue of an app being able to read Safari's browsing history.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause (**insufficient redaction**) and the specific context (browser cache containing sensitive information).\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
