# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-39896

## Vulnerability Description
Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. When relying on SSO providers in combination with local authentication it can be possible to enumerate existing SSO users in the instance. This is possible because if an email address exists in Directus and belongs to a known SSO provider then it will throw a helpful error that the user belongs to another provider. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.13.0.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **improper error handling**
- **impact:** enumerate existing SSO users
- **product:** Directus
- **version:** prior to 10.13.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-39896

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises from the way Directus handles authentication attempts when both SSO and local authentication are enabled. When a user attempts to log in using the regular login form (or API) with an email address that is already associated with an SSO provider, the system throws a specific error message indicating that the user belongs to another provider. This differs from the generic "invalid credentials" error for non-existent or non-SSO users, thus enabling user enumeration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Account Enumeration:** The system provides specific error messages that can be used to differentiate between valid SSO users and invalid email addresses. This allows an attacker to systematically determine which email addresses are registered as SSO users on the Directus instance.
- **Information Disclosure:** The error message reveals whether a specific email is a registered SSO user, exposing sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User Enumeration:** An attacker can identify valid SSO user accounts on a Directus instance. This can be used in targeted phishing attacks, credential stuffing, or other social engineering tactics.
- **Potential for further attacks:** Knowing valid usernames makes it easier to carry out brute-force or password spraying attacks, as the attacker now has a list of potential valid users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
- **Login Form/API:** Attackers can trigger the vulnerability by attempting to log in through the regular login form or through the API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No privileges required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or special privileges.
- **No user interaction:** The attack can be carried out without any user interaction.
- The attacker needs to be able to send login requests to the Directus instance

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Directus versions >= 9.11.
- It's fixed in version 10.13.0.
- The fix included an explicit provider check and removal of user suspended errors in the authentication service.
- A workaround is to disable local logins if only using SSO `AUTH_DISABLE_DEFAULT="true"`
- The vulnerability was introduced as a feature in [#13184](https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/13184)
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-200 (Information Exposure).
- CVSS v3 score: 7.5
- CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
