  "reference_content": "CVE-2025-27980: PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval\n\nThe content discusses an arbitrary file read vulnerability in cashbook v4.0.3. Here's a breakdown of the information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation on the `invoice` parameter in the URL `https://cashbook.oldmoon.top/api/entry/flow/invoice/show?invoice=.. /.. /.. /.. /.. /.. /etc/passwd`. The application directly returns the content of the file specified by this parameter without proper sanitization.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n*   Arbitrary File Read\n*   Lack of Input Validation\n*   Path Traversal\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nAn attacker can read any file on the server that the application has access to, potentially exposing sensitive information like `/etc/passwd`.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n*   Crafting a malicious URL with a path traversal sequence (`../`) to access arbitrary files.  Example: `https://cashbook.oldmoon.top/api/entry/flow/invoice/show?invoice=.. /.. /.. /.. /.. /.. /etc/passwd`\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n*   Network access to the vulnerable application.\n*   Ability to craft and send HTTP requests.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\nThe blog post does not provide specific mitigation steps, but the vulnerability can be fixed by implementing proper input validation and sanitization of the `invoice` parameter to prevent path traversal attacks.  Specifically, the application should not allow directory traversal characters (like \"..\") in the input.\n\nThe content provides more detail than a placeholder CVE description would. It gives a specific example of a vulnerable URL and explains how the vulnerability can be exploited.",

The vulnerability is caused by **improper limitation of pathname**, which allows an attacker to read arbitrary files. |\n| CWE-73 | External Control of File Name or Path | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary CWE. The application directly uses the `invoice` parameter without proper sanitization. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-22, which describes the **improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory**. This vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files due to path traversal. CWE-73 is related since the file path is externally controlled.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe22[\"CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\"]\n    cwe73[\"CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path\"]\n    \n    cwe22 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe73\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe22 primary\n    class cwe73 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  The application receives an externally controlled file name via the `invoice` parameter (CWE-73).\n2.  The application **improperly limits the pathname** to a restricted directory, allowing path traversal (CWE-22).\n3.  The attacker can read arbitrary files on the server.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference content summary. The **arbitrary file read vulnerability** is caused by the **lack of input validation** on the `invoice` parameter, which allows path traversal.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-22, which accurately describes the root cause of the vulnerability. The application does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname, allowing an attacker to read files outside the intended directory. CWE-73 is included as a secondary CWE because the file name or path is externally controlled. This external control is a prerequisite for the path traversal vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
