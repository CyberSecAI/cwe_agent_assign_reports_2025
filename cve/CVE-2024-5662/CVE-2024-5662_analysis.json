  "description": "The Ultimate Post Kit Addons For Elementor - (Post Grid, Post Carousel, Post Slider, Category List, Post Tabs, Timeline, Post Ticker, Tag Cloud) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the url parameter within the Social Count (Static) widget in all versions up to, and including, 3.11.7 due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-5662:\n\n**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**\n\nThe content from Wordfence explicitly mentions \"Ultimate Post Kit Addons For Elementor - (Post Grid, Post Carousel, Post Slider, Category List, Post Tabs, Timeline, Post Ticker, Tag Cloud) <= 3.11.7 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Social Count (Static) Widget\" and its assigned CVE ID: CVE-2024-5662. Therefore, the content is relevant to the specified CVE.\n\n**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** of the 'url' parameter within the Social Count (Static) widget of the Ultimate Post Kit plugin.\n\n**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-provided input, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts that are stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected page.\n\n**4. Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of users who access the affected page. This can be used to:\n    *   **Steal sensitive information:** Cookies, session tokens, etc.\n    *   **Redirect users to malicious websites.**\n    *   **Modify page content and deface websites.**\n    *   **Perform actions on behalf of the user.**\n\n**5. Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Plugin Vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists within the Ultimate Post Kit plugin.\n*   **Specific Parameter:** The attack vector is the `url` parameter within the Social Count (Static) widget configuration.\n\n**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least \"Contributor\" level access to the WordPress site.\n*   **Access to Widget Configuration:** The attacker needs to be able to configure the Social Count (Static) widget via the Elementor editor.\n*   **No User Interaction**: The payload is stored in the database, it executes when a user views the injected page.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The provided Trac changeset diffs show the code modifications related to the fix, focusing on sanitization/escaping in various plugin files (admin settings, css, js)\n*   The Wordfence article clearly states that the vulnerability is a Stored XSS, which means the malicious script is stored on the server (database) and executed when an admin or user opens the page.\n*   The content from plugins.trac.wordpress.org confirms the vulnerability by referencing the affected code in `static-social-count.php` at line 800.\n*   The plugin version is affected up to and including `3.11.7` and it is patched in `3.11.8`.\n*   The Wordfence description also notes that it affects *all versions up to, and including, 3.11.7*, and provides a reference to the plugin repository to obtain the newest version of the plugin.",
