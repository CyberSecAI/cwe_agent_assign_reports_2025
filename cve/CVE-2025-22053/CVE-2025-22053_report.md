# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-22053

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net ibmveth make veth_pool_store stop hanging v2 - Created a single error handling unlock and exit in veth_pool_store - Greatly expanded commit message with previous explanatory-only text Summary Use rtnl_mutex to synchronize veth_pool_store with itself, ibmveth_close and ibmveth_open, preventing multiple calls in a row to napi_disable. Background Two (or more) threads could call veth_pool_store through writing to /sys/devices/vio/30000002/pool*/*. You can do this easily with a little shell script. This causes a hang. I configured LOCKDEP, compiled ibmveth.c with DEBUG, and built a new kernel.

## Relationship Analysis
The primary identified weakness is CWE-667 Improper Locking. This is a Class-level CWE, and the provided description aligns with the general concept of lock mismanagement. CWE-833 Deadlock is a Base-level CWE and a child of CWE-667, representing a specific consequence of improper locking. CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') is a Class-level CWE that represents a different consequence of missing or improper synchronization.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with multiple threads attempting to access the same resource. Due to **improper locking** (CWE-667) mechanisms in `veth_pool_store`, a **deadlock** (CWE-833) occurs, leading to a system hang. The **concurrent execution using shared resource with improper synchronization** (CWE-362) leads to the **improper locking** (CWE-667).

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description clearly indicates a **hang** caused by concurrent access to a shared resource. The stack trace implicates `napi_enable` and `veth_pool_store`, suggesting a locking issue. The core of the vulnerability is that multiple threads can call `veth_pool_store` concurrently, leading to a **deadlock** (CWE-833) because of **improper locking** (CWE-667). The provided evidence points to a synchronization problem involving a mutex.

The primary mapping is CWE-667 Improper Locking because the core issue is the mismanagement of locks, which enables the deadlock. The description states, "Use rtnl_mutex to synchronize veth_pool_store with itself, ibmveth_close and ibmveth_open, preventing multiple calls in a row to napi_disable." This supports the claim that there was **improper locking** mechanisms that could be exploited by multiple threads.

CWE-833 Deadlock is considered a secondary candidate because it describes the direct consequence of the improper locking.

CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') is also considered a secondary candidate, because a race condition is a prerequisite to the **improper locking** condition.

The retriever results also suggest CWE-667 and CWE-833 as possibilities.

The selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity. CWE-667 captures the general class of **improper locking**, while CWE-833 represents the more specific outcome of a deadlock.
# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-667: Improper Locking
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly acquire or release a lock on a resource, leading to unexpected resource state changes and behaviors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-833: Deadlock
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains multiple threads or executable segments that are waiting for each other to release a necessary lock, resulting in deadlock.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class

- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Pillar
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly anticipate or handle exceptional conditions that rarely occur during normal operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: This CWE entry is extremely high-level, a Pillar.

## CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not release or incorrectly releases a resource before it is made available for re-use.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not check the return value from a method or function, which can prevent it from detecting unexpected states and conditions.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-617: Reachable Assertion
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains an assert() or similar statement that can be triggered by an attacker, which leads to an application exit or other behavior that is more severe than necessary.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs multiple related behaviors, but the behaviors are performed in the wrong order in ways which may produce resultant weaknesses.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-243: Creation of chroot Jail Without Changing Working Directory
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 680.04
**Source**: sparse

**Description**:
The product uses the chroot() system call to create a jail, but does not change the working directory afterward. This does not prevent access to files outside of the jail.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
