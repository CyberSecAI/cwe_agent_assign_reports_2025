The key phrase here is \"Privilege escalation\". Based on the retriever results, and the provided CWE classification guidance, several CWEs were considered. The primary focus was to identify the **root cause** of the privilege escalation, rather than the impact itself.\n\nCWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management) was explicitly discouraged in the mapping guidance because it is high-level and often describes the technical impact rather than the root cause.\n\nCWE-266 (Incorrect Privilege Assignment) was chosen as the primary CWE because the vulnerability involves privilege escalation, and the mapping guidance suggests CWE-266 when a user is assigned the wrong role/group, leading to that escalation. However, there is not enough evidence to support this from the description.\n\nCWE-268 (Privilege Chaining) was considered as a secondary CWE because it is related to privilege escalation scenarios. Privilege chaining can be a mechanism how the privilege escalation occurs.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relationships**:\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-9\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-556\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-520\n- PARENTOF -> CWE-1022\n- CANALSOBE -> CWE-286\n\n## CWE-268: Privilege Chaining\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product grants privileges based on other privileges in a way that leads to an unintended bypass of access controls.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n# Complete CWE Specifications\n\nCWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\nA product **incorrectly assigns a privilege** to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\nCWE-268: Privilege Chaining\nThe product grants privileges based on other privileges in a way that leads to an unintended bypass of access controls.\n\n```text\n\n```",

It is important to always know when and how privileged APIs can be called in order to ensure that their elevated level of privilege cannot be exploited.\n",
