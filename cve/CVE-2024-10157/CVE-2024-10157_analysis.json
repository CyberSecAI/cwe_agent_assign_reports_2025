  "description": "A vulnerability was found in PHPGurukul Boat Booking System 1.0. It has been rated as critical. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /admin/password-recovery.php of the component Reset Your Password Page. The manipulation of the argument username leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10157\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `username` parameter during the password reset process. Specifically, the application does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command, leading to SQL injection.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application constructs an SQL query using the `username` parameter directly, without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Confidentiality:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, such as usernames, passwords, and other user information.\n- **Integrity:** An attacker can modify or delete data within the database, leading to data corruption or loss.\n- **Availability:** An attacker can potentially disrupt the application's functionality by injecting SQL code that causes errors or crashes.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The attack vector is through the `/admin/password-recovery.php` page.\n- Specifically, the `username` parameter is the injection point.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to access the password reset functionality of the application.\n- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `username` parameter, which is likely done through a web form.\n-  The attacker can use tools like Burp Suite to intercept and modify the HTTP request with the malicious SQL payload.\n-  The attacker can use SQLMap to automate the process of exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.",
