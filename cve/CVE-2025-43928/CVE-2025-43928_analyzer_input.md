# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-43928

## Vulnerability Description
In Infodraw Media Relay Service (MRS) 7.1.0.0, the MRS web server (on port 12654) allows reading arbitrary files via **../ directory traversal** in the username field. Reading ServerParameters.xml may reveal administrator credentials in cleartext or with MD5 hashing.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **component:** MRS web server
- **rootcause:** **../ directory traversal**
- **product:** Infodraw Media Relay Service
- **impact:** ['arbitrary file read', 'reading arbitrary files']
- **version:** MRS 7.1.0.0

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-43928 related content

**Overall Assessment:** The provided content is highly relevant to CVE-2025-43928 and provides significantly more detail than the placeholder CVE description. It details a path traversal vulnerability in Infodraw's Media Relay Service (MRS) software, used for surveillance devices.

**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is a path traversal vulnerability in the username parameter of the web server (MRS).  The software allows login with any username, and then uses this input directly in file operations without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to access arbitrary files on the system.

**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Path Traversal (Directory Traversal):** The primary vulnerability.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The software does not properly validate the username input, allowing "../../../../" sequences.
*   **Insecure Password Handling:** MD5 hashing is used without salting, making password cracking easier.
*   **Unintended Functionality:** Allowing login with any username is an error that contributes to the exploitability.

**3. Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Access:** Attackers can read any file on the affected system.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive data, including configuration files (ServerParameter.xml) and potentially credentials, can be stolen.
*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Attackers can delete files on the system.
*   **Potential for Privilege Escalation:**  Systems integrated with Active Directory could be vulnerable to lateral movement and privilege escalation.
*   **Compromise of Surveillance Systems:**  Compromised systems include police drones, body cameras, and surveillance equipment.

**4. Attack vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network (port 12654/HTTP).
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability (login with any username).
*   **Exploitation via Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of the MRS software.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected system.
*   **Basic Web Exploitation Knowledge:** Understanding of path traversal vulnerabilities and HTTP requests is required.
*   **No Special Privileges:** The attack does not require any special privileges or credentials.

**6. Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Take Application Offline:** The primary recommendation is to immediately take the application offline until a patch is available.
*   **Network Segmentation:** If taking the application offline is not possible, implement network segmentation and access controls.
*   **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation to sanitize the username parameter and prevent path traversal sequences.
*   **Update Software:** Apply security patches as soon as they become available from the vendor.
*   **Forensic Investigation:** Conduct a forensic investigation to determine if a compromise has occurred.

**Additional Details (More than official CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Mint Secure.
*   Affected countries include Belgium and Luxembourg (police systems).
*   The vulnerability affects both Linux and Windows systems.
*   The CVSS score is estimated to be at least 7.2 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).
*   The vulnerability was presented at the Chaos Computer Clubâ€™s Easterhegg 2025 conference.
*   The manufacturer, Infodraw, was initially unresponsive to vulnerability reports.
