While the description points towards authorization issues, the available evidence does not provide enough detail to confidently select a more specific CWE such as CWE-862 or CWE-863. CWE-862 Missing Authorization, a child of CWE-285 Improper Authorization and CWE-287 Improper Authentication, was considered as a secondary option, useful if more specific information about missing authorization checks were available.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe287 -->|PEEROF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe284 primary\n    class cwe862,cwe285,cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Improper Access Control** (**CWE-284**), leading to a security feature bypass, and ultimately resulting in unauthorized access, affecting confidentiality and integrity.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the **root cause** of the vulnerability. The vulnerability description and the CVE reference link content summary clearly indicate that the **root cause** is **Improper Access Control** (**CWE-284**). The evidence provided supports this classification with high confidence, especially given the explicit mention in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary.\n\nThe analysis considered the provided guidance, particularly regarding authentication vs. authorization vs. access control. Given the available information, **CWE-284** appears to be the most appropriate high-level classification. Although the vulnerability leads to a security feature bypass and unauthorized access, the lack of specific details prevents a more granular classification.\n\nThe selection of **CWE-284** as the primary CWE is based on the explicit statement in the CVE Reference Links Content Summary: \"Root cause of vulnerability: Improper Access Control (CWE-284)\". The confidence in this mapping is high (0.9) because it is directly supported by the provided evidence.\n\nCWE-862 was considered because the vulnerability results in unauthorized access, suggesting a potential **missing authorization** check. However, without more detailed information on whether an authorization check was intended but missing, it's more accurate to classify this as a general **Improper Access Control** issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable.
