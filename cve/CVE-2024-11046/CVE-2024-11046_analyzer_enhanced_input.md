## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in D-Link DI-8003 16.07.16A1. It has been classified as critical. Affected is the function upgrade_filter_asp of the file /upgrade_filter.asp. The manipulation of the argument path leads to os **command injection**. It is possible to launch the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **vector:** manipulation of argument path
- **product:** D-Link DI-8003
- **version:** 16.07.16A1
- **component:** upgrade_filter_asp in /upgrade_filter.asp

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to a potential vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `upgrade_filter.asp` page of the D-Link DI-8003 router's firmware. The `path` parameter of this page is vulnerable to command injection.
- The application concatenates the user-supplied path with a system command without proper sanitization, leading to command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection, where an attacker can insert arbitrary commands into the `path` parameter, which are then executed by the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary command execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the router's operating system.
- **Full system compromise:** This can lead to a full compromise of the device, including data theft, modification of system configurations, and installation of malware.
- **Denial of service:** The attacker could also render the device unusable.

**Attack vectors:**

- **HTTP GET request:** The attack is performed through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/upgrade_filter.asp` endpoint.
- **Path parameter injection:** The `path` parameter within this GET request is manipulated to inject malicious commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface. This could be from the LAN if the attacker is on the local network, or potentially from the WAN if the router's web interface is exposed to the internet, or through cross-site request forgery from a malicious webpage.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be able to get past the login page. The content indicates the usage of a weak password is a prerequisite for the exploit, meaning a default or easily guessed password is used by the router.

**Technical details:**
- The provided example demonstrates a successful attack using a crafted GET request.
- The example uses backticks (\`) to execute the command `ps > /rce.txt`, which redirects the output of the `ps` (process status) command to a file named `/rce.txt`. This confirms command execution vulnerability.
- The attacker sends a cookie containing a pre-existing valid session using parameters `wys_userid=admin` and `wys_passwd=861A198CDBD425F0B9D91C42FAB93A86`, this session is a requirement to trigger the vulnerability

**Summary:**
The content describes a command injection vulnerability in the D-Link DI-8003 router. By exploiting the vulnerable `path` parameter in the `upgrade_filter.asp` page, an attacker can execute arbitrary system commands, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the device. The attacker needs to be able to log in with a weak password to make the exploitation possible. This vulnerability is related to a lack of input validation in the firmware.
