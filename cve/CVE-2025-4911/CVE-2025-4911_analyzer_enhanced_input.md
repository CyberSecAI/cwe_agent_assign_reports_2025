## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-4911 Content

This content **IS RELATED** to a vulnerability report, specifically a SQL injection vulnerability. It provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description would.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the "viewid" parameter in the `/admin/view-foreigner-ticket.php` file. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through this parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized database access
*   Sensitive data leakage
*   Data tampering/modification
*   Potential for complete system control
*   Disruption of services

**Attack vectors:**

*   The "viewid" parameter in a GET request to `/zms/admin/view-foreigner-ticket.php` is the attack vector.
*   The report provides example payloads for boolean-based blind, time-based blind, and UNION query attacks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   An attacker needs to be able to craft and send malicious HTTP GET requests.
*   Knowledge of SQL injection techniques is required.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   **Employ prepared statements and parameter binding:** This is the primary recommended mitigation.
*   **Conduct input validation and filtering:**  Validate and filter user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats.
*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use database accounts with the least necessary privileges.
