# Analysis for CVE-2025-4911

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-89 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the decision was the direct match of the vulnerability description to the definition of CWE-89. No parent-child or chain relationships were relevant in this case, as the vulnerability is a straightforward SQL injection. The abstraction level is appropriate, as CWE-89 is a Base level CWE.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain consists of a single weakness: **improper neutralization** of special elements leading to **SQL Injection**.
  - Root Cause: **Improper Neutralization**
  - Impact: **SQL Injection**

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the clear evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary. The vulnerability involves the manipulation of the `viewid` argument in `/admin/view-foreigner-ticket.php`, leading to **SQL injection**. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this by stating that the vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `viewid` parameter.

The selection of CWE-89 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: the **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an SQL command.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.79
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 2.98
**Source**: graph

**Description**:
The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 2.91
**Source**: graph

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 2.59
**Source**: graph

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine
**Abstraction Level**: base
**Similarity Score**: 2.33
**Source**: graph

**Description**:
CWE-1336: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: base
**Similarity Score**: 2.21
**Source**: graph

**Description**:
CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
**Abstraction Level**: base
**Similarity Score**: 2.21
**Source**: graph

**Description**:
CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
**Abstraction Level**: base
**Similarity Score**: 2.21
**Source**: graph

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence
**Abstraction Level**: base
**Similarity Score**: 2.21
**Source**: graph

**Description**:
CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

The following CWEs were considered but not used:

*   CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')): While **improper neutralization** is a factor, the context is specific to SQL commands, making CWE-89 a more accurate fit.
*   CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type): This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability does not involve file uploads.
*   CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')): This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability is not related to authorization bypass.
*   CWE-1336 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine): This CWE is not relevant as the application does not use a template engine in a vulnerable way.
*   CWE-184 (Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs): While related to **improper neutralization**, the specific issue is with SQL commands, not a general list of disallowed inputs.
*   CWE-494 (Download of Code Without Integrity Check): This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability does not involve downloading code.
*   CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')): This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability is not related to path traversal.
*   CWE-41 (Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence): This CWE is not relevant as the vulnerability is not related to path equivalence.
