CWE-20 is a base-level CWE, offering a specific characterization of the **root cause**. CWE-200 represents the impact of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe20 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **Improper Input Validation** (CWE-20). Due to this **failure to validate input**, a high privileged attacker with local access is able to trigger **Information Disclosure** (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly states that the Dell PowerEdge Platform contains an **Improper Input Validation** vulnerability. The description also clearly states that a high privileged attacker with local access could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to **Information disclosure**.\n\nThe primary CWE is CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation**, as it is the direct **root cause** of the vulnerability. The retriever results also show that CWE-20 is the top candidate CWE for the \"**Improper Input Validation**\" keyphrase.\n\nCWE-200 **Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor** is included as a secondary CWE because the vulnerability ultimately leads to information disclosure.
