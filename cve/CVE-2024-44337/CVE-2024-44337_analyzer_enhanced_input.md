## Vulnerability Description
The package `github.com/gomarkdown/markdown` is a Go library for parsing Markdown text and rendering as HTML. Prior to pseudoversion `v0.0.0-20240729232818-a2a9c4f`, which corresponds with commit `a2a9c4f76ef5a5c32108e36f7c47f8d310322252`, there was a logical problem in the paragraph function of the parser/block.go file, which allowed a remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition by providing a tailor-made input that caused an infinite loop, causing the program to hang and consume resources indefinitely. Submit `a2a9c4f76ef5a5c32108e36f7c47f8d310322252` contains fixes to this problem.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-44337:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `paragraph` function within the `parser/block.go` file of the `github.com/gomarkdown/markdown` Go library.
- A logical flaw existed in how the parser handled list definitions, specifically when encountering an empty list definition following a paragraph.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The parser's logic for handling definition lists had a flaw where it could enter an infinite loop when parsing a specific crafted input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker could cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition by providing a crafted Markdown input to the vulnerable parser.
- This crafted input would trigger the infinite loop, causing the program using the library to hang and consume resources indefinitely.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is providing a specially crafted Markdown input string to the vulnerable parser.
- This input must contain a specific sequence of characters that triggers the infinite loop in the paragraph function.
- The provided example input string is: `~~~~\xb4~\x94~\x94~\xd1\r\r:\xb4\x94\x94~\x9f~\xb4~\x94~\x94\x94`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted Markdown input to a system utilizing the vulnerable version of `github.com/gomarkdown/markdown` library. This could be via a web application, file processing system, or any other system that consumes and parses markdown with the vulnerable library.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in commit `a2a9c4f76ef5a5c32108e36f7c47f8d310322252`, which corresponds to pseudoversion `v0.0.0-20240729232818-a2a9c4f`.
- The fix involved modifying the `paragraph` function in `parser/block.go` to properly handle empty list definitions and prevent the infinite loop.
- A test case named `TestBug311` was also added to the `parser/parser_test.go` file to specifically verify the fix and prevent regressions.
- The issue was initially reported via  [Issue #311](https://github.com/gomarkdown/markdown/issues/311)
