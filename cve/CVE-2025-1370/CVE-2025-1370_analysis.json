  "description": "A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in MicroWorld eScan Antivirus 7.0.32 on Linux. Affected by this issue is the function sprintf of the file epsdaemon of the component Autoscan USB. The manipulation leads to os **command injection**. An attack has to be approached locally. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

The retriever results also list CWE-78 as a highly relevant CWE. The description explicitly mentions \"sprintf\" which is a function susceptible to format string vulnerabilities, but the root cause is directly related to command injection. Therefore, CWE-78 is the most appropriate primary CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
