This key is used when no specific encryption key is configured in the project.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is the use of a hard-coded, security-relevant constant, specifically the encryption key (CWE-547). This makes the default encryption key easily compromised.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can decrypt any encrypted project data if the default encryption key was used in the Mendix project.\n- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network (AV:N).\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability (PR:N, UI:N). They just need to be able to access the encrypted data.",

The **hard-coded encryption key** is a credential. |\n| CWE-321 | Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key | 0.9 | Variant | Allowed | Secondary CWE. This is a more specific type of credential. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials), which is a Base level CWE. A more specific Variant of CWE-798 is CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key). The vulnerability involves a **hard-coded cryptographic key**, which falls under both CWEs. CWE-321 is a child of CWE-798, making it a more precise classification.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe798[\"CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials\"]\n    cwe321[\"CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key\"]\n\n    cwe321 -->|CHILDOF| cwe798\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe798 primary\n    class cwe321 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **hard-coded encryption key** (CWE-798 and CWE-321). This leads to the ability for an attacker to decrypt any encrypted project data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary root cause is the use of a **hard-coded encryption key**, which directly leads to the vulnerability.\n\nThe vulnerability description states: \"Affected versions of the module define a **specific hard-coded default value for the EncryptionKey constant**, which is used in projects where no individual EncryptionKey was specified. This could allow to an attacker to decrypt any encrypted project data, as the default encryption key can be considered compromised.\"\n\nThe CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms this: \"The Mendix Encryption module versions V10.0.0 and V10.0.1 use a hard-coded default value for the EncryptionKey constant... The vulnerability is the use of a hard-coded, security-relevant constant, specifically the encryption key (CWE-547). This makes the default encryption key easily compromised. An attacker can decrypt any encrypted project data if the default encryption key was used in the Mendix project.\"\n\nBased on this evidence, CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) is the most appropriate primary CWE. CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key) is included as a secondary CWE because it provides more specificity.\n\nOther CWEs Considered:\n\n*   CWE-547 (Use of Hard-coded, Security-relevant Constants): While mentioned in the CVE summary, it's less specific than CWE-798 as the constant is specifically a credential.\n*   CWE-1394 (Use of Default Cryptographic Key): This is close, but CWE-798 and CWE-321 are more precise in describing the root cause, which is the hard-coding of the key, not just its default usage.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity.
