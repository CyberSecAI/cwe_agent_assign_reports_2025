  "description": "OpenCTI is an open-source cyber threat intelligence platform. In versions starting from 6.4.8 to before 6.4.10, the **allow/deny lists can be bypassed**, allowing a user to change attributes that are intended to be unmodifiable by the user. It is possible to toggle the `external` flag on/off and change the own token value for a user. It is also possible to edit attributes that are not in the allow list, such as `otp_qr` and `otp_activated`. If external users exist in the OpenCTI setup and the information about these users identities is sensitive, the above vulnerabilities can be used to enumerate existing user accounts as a standard low privileged user. This issue has been patched in version 6.4.10.",

CWE-184 (Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs) is a more specific, base-level weakness compared to the class-level CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization). The vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **bypassing of allow/deny lists**, which aligns directly with the concept of an incomplete list of disallowed inputs.

This allows an attacker (a low-privileged user in this case) to modify attributes they shouldn't be able to, leading to **improper authorization (CWE-863/CWE-285)**. The impact of this is the ability to toggle flags, change token values, edit unauthorized attributes, and potentially enumerate user accounts.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe primary CWE selected is CWE-184 (Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs) with high confidence. The vulnerability description states, \"the **allow/deny lists can be bypassed**, allowing a user to change attributes that are intended to be unmodifiable by the user.\" This directly maps to the definition of CWE-184, where a protection mechanism relies on a list of disallowed inputs, but the list is incomplete, allowing unauthorized modifications.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) and CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) were considered because the **bypass** leads to unauthorized actions. However, these are higher-level classifications and less specific than CWE-184, which directly addresses the root cause of the **bypassed allow/deny lists**. The retriever results also suggest CWE-184 as the best fit.\n\nThe decision to prioritize CWE-184 is based on the principle of selecting the most specific CWE that accurately represents the root cause. The evidence from the vulnerability description strongly supports this choice, and the relationship analysis confirms that it is a more granular representation than the broader authorization-related CWEs. The ability for a low privileged user to **bypass** the intended restrictions on which fields they can modify, allowing them to change attributes and potentially enumerate user accounts, is a direct consequence of the **incomplete** nature of the **allow/deny list**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed -
