That filename is later transmitted to the client in order to show a list of configuration files. Due to a **missing escape or sanitization**, the filename could be executed as HTML script tag resulting in a cross-site-scripting attack.",

CWE-79 is a more specific case of improper neutralization that leads directly to cross-site scripting. CWE-116 is considered as a secondary weakness because the **missing escape or sanitization** can be seen as a failure to properly encode the output.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n    cwe138[\"CWE-138: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements\"]\n\n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe138\n    cwe116 -->|CHILDOF| cwe138\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe116 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing escape or sanitization** of a filename, leading to the injection of a script tag into a web page, which results in cross-site scripting.\n- **Root Cause:** **Missing escape or sanitization** of filename.\n- **Weakness:** Injection of script tag into a web page.\n- **Impact:** Cross-site scripting.\n\nTherefore, the chain is: **Missing Sanitization** -> CWE-79 -> XSS\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description that mentions \"**missing escape or sanitization**\" leading to a \"cross-site-scripting attack.\" This directly aligns with CWE-79, which describes \"Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting').\" The retriever results also listed CWE-79 with a high score.\n\nCWE-116 was also considered, as the **missing escape or sanitization** could be classified as a failure to properly encode output.

While CWE-138 is a more general class, CWE-79 provides the necessary specificity for the described vulnerability.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-79 directly addresses the root cause and impact of the vulnerability, while CWE-116 provides a broader perspective on the encoding issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
