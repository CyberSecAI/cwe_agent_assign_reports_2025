## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved f2fs dont set RO when shutting down f2fs **Shutdown does not check the error of thaw_super due to readonly**, which causes a deadlock like below. f2fs_ioc_shutdown(F2FS_GOING_DOWN_FULLSYNC) issue_discard_thread - bdev_freeze - freeze_super - f2fs_stop_checkpoint() - f2fs_handle_critical_error - sb_start_write - set RO - waiting - bdev_thaw - thaw_super_locked - return -EINVAL, if sb_rdonly() - f2fs_stop_discard_thread -> wait for kthread_stop(discard_thread)

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **Shutdown does not check the error of thaw_super due to readonly**
- **impact:** deadlock
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** f2fs

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the f2fs filesystem's shutdown procedure. During shutdown, the code attempts to set the filesystem to read-only (RO) mode. However, this action bypasses the `thaw_super` function, which is necessary to properly unlock the superblock. If `thaw_super` is called when the superblock is already read-only it returns an error, causing a deadlock during shutdown.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Race Condition/Deadlock:** The core vulnerability is a deadlock. The process of shutting down the f2fs filesystem involves multiple steps including freezing the block device (`bdev_freeze`), freezing the superblock, stopping the checkpointing thread, and the discard thread. Setting the filesystem to read-only during a critical error, within `f2fs_handle_critical_error`, prevents the subsequent `thaw_super_locked` call from completing successfully, resulting in a wait for the discard thread to terminate. However, the discard thread is also blocked waiting for the superblock to be unfrozen.
- **Improper Error Handling:** The shutdown procedure didn't account for the possibility of `thaw_super` failing due to the filesystem being read-only, which would trigger the deadlock scenario.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **System Hang/Denial of Service:** The primary impact is a system hang or denial of service. The deadlock prevents the f2fs filesystem from shutting down correctly, which can lead to the system becoming unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Filesystem Shutdown:** The vulnerability is triggered during the normal process of shutting down an f2fs filesystem. The specific conditions leading to the error can involve the  `f2fs_ioc_shutdown` ioctl command with the `F2FS_GOING_DOWN_FULLSYNC` option which can be triggered by a user with the appropriate privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have the ability to trigger a shutdown of an f2fs filesystem, which typically requires administrative privileges (e.g., root access).

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves preventing the setting of RO mode when shutting down the filesystem. By not setting the filesystem to RO during shutdown, the `thaw_super` call can be successfully executed, thereby preventing the deadlock. The patch adds `|| shutdown` to the `if` conditional, skipping the read-only remount when shutting down.
- The provided code snippets show the fix being applied to the `fs/f2fs/super.c` file.
- The patch prevents the system from entering into a deadlock during the shutdown procedure.
