## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
ROOT CAUSE:
*   There is a vertical override vulnerability in the /admin/add-subadmin.php system. In the system design, only super administrators can add sub administrators, but due to the lack of verification of user session identity in request verification, resulting in low privileged users being able to successfully send requests to add sub administrators directly.

WEAKNESSES/VULNERABILITIES PRESENT:
*   Access control vulnerability.

IMPACT OF EXPLOITATION:
*   The system does not have strict permission verification, resulting in the creation of unauthorized users, bringing information leakage and management risks.

ATTACK VECTORS:
*   A low-privileged user can send a request to add a sub-administrator.

REQUIRED ATTACKER CAPABILITIES/POSITION:
*   Low-privileged user.

MITIGATION OR FIX:
*   Regarding access control vulnerabilities, suggestions are provided from three key aspects: authentication and authorization, session and token management, and secure coding and development. In terms of authentication and authorization, multi-factor authentication, role-based access control, and fine-grained permission management are adopted to ensure the authenticity of user identities and the rationality of permissions. For session and token management, access security is guaranteed through secure session policies, encrypted tokens, and regular token refreshing and revocation. In the secure coding and development phase, following standards, regularly reviewing code, and using secure frameworks and libraries reduce the risk of privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
