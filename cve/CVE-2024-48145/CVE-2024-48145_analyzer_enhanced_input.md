## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is a prompt injection vulnerability within the chatbox of Netangular Technologies' ChatNet AI Version v1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The application is vulnerable to prompt injection. This means that user-supplied input to the chatbox is not properly sanitized or handled, allowing it to be interpreted as a command by the AI assistant.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can access and exfiltrate all previous and subsequent chat data between the user and the AI assistant. This includes potentially sensitive information shared in the conversation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted malicious prompt injected into the application's chat window.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the chat interface, i.e., they need to be able to input text into the chat box.
- No special permissions or elevated access is needed.

**Technical Details:**
- When a malicious prompt is entered, it causes the application to send the full chat history (past and future) to an attacker-controlled site. This indicates that the crafted prompt likely contains code that instructs the AI assistant to output the chat log and send it to a specific URL.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content directly references CVE-2024-48145 and contains a PoC description that aligns with the provided information.
