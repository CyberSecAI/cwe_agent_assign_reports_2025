## Vulnerability Description
When an incoming DNS protocol message includes a Transaction Signature (TSIG), BIND always checks it. If the TSIG contains an invalid value in the algorithm field, BIND immediately aborts with an assertion failure. This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.20.0 through 9.20.8 and 9.21.0 through 9.21.7.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **invalid algorithm field in Transaction Signature (TSIG)**
- **impact:** abort with assertion failure
- **product:** BIND
- **version:** 9.20.0 through 9.20.8, 9.21.0 through 9.21.7

    *   **CVE:** CVE-2025-40775
    *   **Title:** DNS message with invalid TSIG causes an assertion failure
    *   **Program impacted:** BIND 9
    *   **Versions affected:**
        *   9.20.0 -> 9.20.8
        *   9.21.0 -> 9.21.7
    *   **Severity:** High
    *   **Exploitable:** Remotely
    *   **Description:** When an incoming DNS protocol message includes a Transaction Signature (TSIG), BIND always checks it. If the TSIG contains an invalid value in the algorithm field, BIND immediately aborts with an assertion failure.
    *   **Impact:** Denial-of-service. By sending specific messages to the server, an attacker can cause named to terminate unexpectedly. Both Authoritative servers and Resolvers are affected.
    *   **CVSS Score:** 7.5
    *   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
    *   **Workarounds:** No workarounds known.
    *   **Active exploits:** This flaw was discovered in internal testing. We are not aware of any active exploits.
    *   **Solution:** Upgrade to the patched release most closely related to your current version of BIND 9:
        *   9.20.9
        *   9.21.8

*   The email provides the following information:
    *   **Source:** Internet Systems Consortium (ISC)
    *   **Affected Software:** BIND 9
    *   **Vulnerability:** DNS message with invalid TSIG causes an assertion failure.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS)
