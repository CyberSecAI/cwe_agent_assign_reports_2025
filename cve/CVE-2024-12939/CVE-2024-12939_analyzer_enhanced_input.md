## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in code-projects Job Recruitment 1.0. It has been rated as critical. This issue affects the function add_edu of the file /_parse/_all_edits.php. The manipulation of the argument degree leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Other parameters might be affected as well.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **product:** code-projects Job Recruitment
- **version:** 1
- **component:** add_edu of the file /_parse/_all_edits.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
The provided content contains information about a SQL injection vulnerability in the "job-recruitment-in-php" system. This vulnerability is related to the `add_edu` function and the `degree` parameter.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `degree` parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `degree` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   A malicious attacker can use this vulnerability to obtain sensitive database information. This could potentially lead to data breaches, unauthorized access to user accounts, or modification of data.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `_parse/_all_edits.php` endpoint with the `action` set to `add_edu` and a malicious payload in the `degree` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. They do not appear to require any specific privileges other than being able to send requests.
*   The attacker has to have knowledge of the application's structure and how to access the vulnerable functionality.
*   The attacker should have some understanding of SQL to craft effective injection payloads.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (POC) showing how to exploit the vulnerability using `sqlmap`. The POC demonstrates how to inject SQL code through the `degree` parameter.
*   The `job-recruitment-in-php` application, which was the target of this vulnerability, is found on the `code-projects.org` website.
*   The provided github link contains a report of this vulnerability in `sql-hi.md` file.
