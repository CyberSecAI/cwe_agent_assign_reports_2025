# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-10025

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability in the .sdd file allows an attacker to read default passwords stored in plain text within the code. By exploiting these **plaintext credentials**, an attacker can log into affected SICK products as an Authorized Client if the customer has not changed the default password.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **plaintext credentials**
- **impact:** log into affected SICK products as an Authorized Client
- **attacker:** attacker
- **product:** SICK products
- **component:** .sdd file

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-10025:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the storage of default passwords in plain text within the `.sdd` files of certain SICK products.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The primary vulnerability is the insecure storage of passwords, making them easily readable by an attacker who has access to the `.sdd` files.
*   **Hard-coded Credentials:** The use of default passwords, which are then stored insecurely, means that if these default passwords are not changed, they can be used to gain unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who exploits this vulnerability can gain access to the "Authorized Client" user role of the affected SICK products.
*   **Loss of Availability and Integrity:** Successful exploitation could potentially lead to a disruption in the availability of the devices and compromise their operational integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without requiring prior authentication.
*   **Network Access:** The attack vector is via the network and can be initiated by an attacker who can access the network where the SICK device is located.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to have network access to the affected SICK products.
*   **Technical Skills:** The attacker must be capable of locating and extracting the plain text passwords from the .sdd file.
*   **No prior authentication:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details from the provided documents:**

*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects the following SICK product families, across all firmware versions: CLV6xx, RFx6xx and Lector6xx.
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.1, indicating a critical severity.
*   **Mitigation:** The primary recommendation is for users to immediately change the default passwords.
*   **CWE:** The vulnerability is classified under CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials).
*   **SICK PSIRT:** SICK's Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for handling vulnerabilities related to SICK products and their advisories.

In summary, CVE-2024-10025 is a critical vulnerability due to the insecure storage of default credentials in multiple SICK products that allows remote unauthenticated attackers to gain unauthorized access with potentially significant impacts on availability and integrity.
