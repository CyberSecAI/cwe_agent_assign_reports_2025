  "description": "Autel MaxiCharger AC Elite Business C50 AppAuthenExchangeRandomNum **Stack-Based Buffer Overflow** Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Autel MaxiCharger AC Elite Business C50 EV chargers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of the AppAuthenExchangeRandomNum BLE command. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer**. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device. Was ZDI-CAN-23384.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation when handling the `AppAuthenExchangeRandomNum` BLE command. Specifically, the length of user-supplied data is not checked before being copied into a fixed-size stack-based buffer.\n\n*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n    *   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:**  The primary weakness is a stack-based buffer overflow, which occurs because the application attempts to copy data of an arbitrary length into a buffer with a fixed size on the stack without validating the size of the incoming data.\n\n*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device.\n\n*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-adjacent, leveraging the device's BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) interface through the `AppAuthenExchangeRandomNum` command.\n\n*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n    *   The attacker needs to be network-adjacent to the affected device.\n    *   Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n*   **Additional Details:** The vulnerability is fixed in firmware versions EU v1.51.00 and US v1.36.00.\n\nThis content provides more details than the basic CVE description.",

CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is a related weakness because the **lack of validation** of the input length is the root cause that leads to the stack-based buffer overflow.

The vulnerability description explicitly states that the issue results from the \"**lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer**.\" The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" also confirms this.\n\nCWE-121 is chosen because the buffer overflow occurs on the stack, making it a more specific variant of CWE-119. CWE-1284 is included to capture the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **lack of input validation**.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-121 and CWE-1284 as potential candidates, supporting the selection.\n\nCWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) was considered but not chosen as the primary CWE because CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) is a more specific and appropriate selection. The mapping guidance for CWE-20 also discourages its use when lower-level CWEs can be used instead.\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
