## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `/faculty/check_faculty_login.php` file of the "Attendance Tracking Management System PHP & MySQL Project"
- The root cause is insufficient user input validation of the `faculty_emailid` parameter. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: Specifically, boolean-based blind, stacked queries, and time-based blind SQL injection vulnerabilities are present.
- Lack of Input sanitization: The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the `faculty_emailid` parameter before using it in SQL queries.
- Direct use of user input in SQL queries without proper escaping or using prepared statements.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access: Attackers can gain access to the database without proper authentication.
- Sensitive data leakage: Attackers can read sensitive data stored in the database.
- Data tampering: Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- Comprehensive system control: In severe cases, it may be possible to gain control of the entire system.
- Service interruption: Attackers may cause a denial of service by disrupting the normal operation of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `faculty_emailid` parameter in the `/faculty/check_faculty_login.php` file.
- The attacker can inject malicious SQL code via POST request to the vulnerable page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not require any prior login or authorization to exploit this vulnerability.
