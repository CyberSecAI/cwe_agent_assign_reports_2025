  "description": "z2d is a pure Zig 2D graphics library. Versions of z2d after `0.5.1` and up to and including `0.6.0`, when writing from one surface to another using `z2d.compositor.StrideCompositor.run`, and higher-level operations when the anti-aliasing mode is set to `.default` (such as `Context.fill`, `Context.stroke`, `painter.fill`, and `painter.stroke`), the source surface can be completely out-of-bounds on the x-axis, but not on the y-axis, by way of a negative offset. This results in an **overflow of the value controlling the length of the stride**. In non-safe optimization modes (consumers compiling with `ReleaseFast` or `ReleaseSmall`), this could potentially lead to invalid memory accesses or corruption. This issue is patched in version `0.6.1`. Users on an untagged version after `v0.5.1` and before `v0.6.1` are advised to update to address the vulnerability. Those still on Zig `0.13.0` are recommended to downgrade to `v0.5.1`.",

  "reference_content": "CVE-2025-46333 - Placeholder - Implement CVE description retrieval\n\nBased on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the potential vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is an out-of-bounds (OOB) composition issue when writing one surface to another using `z2d.compositor.SurfaceCompositor.run`. Specifically, it occurs when the source surface is completely out-of-bounds on the x-axis (but not the y-axis) due to a negative offset, leading to an overflow in the stride length calculation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds write condition.\n*   **Integer overflow:** A negative offset causes an integer overflow when calculating the stride length.\n*   **Memory corruption/Invalid memory access:** In non-safe optimization modes (`ReleaseFast` or `ReleaseSmall`), this can lead to invalid memory access or corruption.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Invalid memory access:** Potential for the program to access memory it shouldn't.\n*   **Memory corruption:** Data in memory could be overwritten, leading to unpredictable behavior.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Creating a scenario where a source surface is positioned out-of-bounds on the x-axis during composition.\n*   Using higher-level operations like `Context.fill`, `Context.stroke`, `painter.fill`, and `painter.stroke` with the default anti-aliasing mode, which internally use `SurfaceCompositor.run`.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to control the input data or surface parameters to create the out-of-bounds condition.\n*   Local access is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   Updating to version 0.6.1 of the `z2d` library.\n*   Downgrading to v0.5.1 if still using Zig 0.13.0.\n*   The fix involves ensuring that the compositor handles out-of-bounds conditions correctly, preventing the negative offset from causing an overflow.\n\n**Additional Details (more detail than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The issue was introduced around commit `7617190e59875415df88bc1d82b465949d154d98`.\n*   The vulnerability is related to how the mask is constructed in higher-level operations when anti-aliasing is enabled.\n*   The provided test case demonstrates the vulnerability.\n*   CVSS v4 score: 7.3/10.\n*   CVSS Vector: CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:P/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H\n\nThe content provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, its impact, and how to mitigate it.",

The integer overflow leads to an incorrect calculation, which then allows a write outside of the intended memory region. CWE-190 is a child of CWE-20 **Improper Input Validation**, indicating a failure to validate the integer before the calculation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    cwe190 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe20 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a negative offset causing an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) when calculating the stride length. This leads to an incorrect stride length, which then results in an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787) during the surface composition operation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several potential CWEs, including CWE-125 **Out-of-bounds Read**, CWE-122 **Heap-based Buffer Overflow**, and CWE-190 **Integer Overflow or Wraparound**. However, after reviewing the vulnerability description and the CVE Reference Links Content Summary, the root cause is clearly an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) that leads to an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787).\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description is: \"the source surface can be completely out-of-bounds on the x-axis...by way of a negative offset. This results in an **overflow of the value controlling the length of the stride**.\" This strongly indicates CWE-190 as the primary cause. The subsequent \"invalid memory accesses or corruption\" points to CWE-787 as the direct result of the overflow.\n\nThe graph relationships reinforce this, as CWE-190 can precede CWE-787.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately represent the root cause (integer overflow) and the direct consequence (out-of-bounds write) of the vulnerability.\n\n#
