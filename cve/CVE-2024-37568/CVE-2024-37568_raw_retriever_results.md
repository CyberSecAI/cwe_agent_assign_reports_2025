# Raw Retriever Results for CVE-2024-37568
## Query
lepture Authlib before 1.3.1 has algorithm confusion with asymmetric public keys. Unless an algorithm is specified in a jwt.decode call, HMAC verification is allowed with any asymmetric public key. (This is similar to CVE-2022-29217 and CVE-2024-33663.)

## Keyphrases
- **rootcause**: 'algorithm confusion with asymmetric public keys'
