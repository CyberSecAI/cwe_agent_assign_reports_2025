## Vulnerability Description
authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Access restrictions assigned to an application were not checked when using the OAuth2 Device code flow. This could potentially allow users without the correct authorization to get OAuth tokens for an application and access it. This issue has been patched in version(s) 2024.6.0, 2024.2.4 and 2024.4.3.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **impact:** get OAuth tokens for an application and access it
- **vector:** using the OAuth2 Device code flow
- **attacker:** users without the correct authorization
- **product:** authentik
- **version:** before 2024.6.0, 2024.2.4 and 2024.4.3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a bug in the OAuth2 Device Code flow implementation within the authentik application. Specifically, access restrictions defined for an application were not being enforced during the device code flow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control checks during the OAuth2 Device Code flow. This allowed users to potentially obtain OAuth tokens for applications without having the necessary permissions.
- **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):** This CWE accurately describes the core of the vulnerability, where the system fails to restrict access to authorized users.
- **CWE-285 (Improper Authorization):** The system fails to properly authorize requests, allowing unauthorized users to obtain access tokens.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation would allow users to bypass intended access controls and obtain OAuth tokens for applications that they should not be authorized to access.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Unauthorized users could gain access to sensitive resources protected by the affected applications.
- **Integrity Loss:** There is potential for the attacker to modify data/resources within the application, since access control was bypassed.
- **Availability Loss:** There is a potential risk of a denial of service since the attacker can now perform operations they normally would not be authorized for.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), indicating that the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **OAuth2 Device Code Flow:** The vulnerability specifically resides within the OAuth2 Device Code flow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required (PR:N):** An attacker does not need any existing privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction Required (UI:N):** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability without requiring any interaction from a user.
- **Low Attack Complexity (AC:L):** The attack is relatively straightforward to execute, requiring minimal effort from the attacker.

**CVSS Metrics:**
- **CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L**
    - **AV:N (Network):** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network.
    - **AC:L (Low):** The attack complexity is low.
    - **PR:N (None):** No privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
    - **UI:N (None):** No user interaction is required.
    - **S:U (Unchanged):** The vulnerability does not change the scope of the system.
    - **C:H (High):** There is a high potential impact on confidentiality.
    - **I:L (Low):** There is a low potential impact on integrity.
    - **A:L (Low):** There is a low potential impact on availability.

**Patched Versions:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in authentik versions 2024.6.0, 2024.4.3, and 2024.2.4.

**Workarounds:**
- While updating is recommended, a workaround involves adding access control to the configured flows within authentik. This is because the authentik flows are still used as part of the OAuth2 Device Code flow.

**Summary**
The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of access controls during the OAuth2 Device Code flow in the authentik application. This lack of access control enforcement could allow unauthorized users to gain access to protected resources. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, does not require any privileges or user interaction, and is considered to have a high impact on confidentiality, with low potential impact on integrity and availability. Patched versions are available.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control

**Authentication**:
Determines *who* the actor is (identity validation). This is typically the *first step* in access control.

* Example phrases: "user must log in", "lack of login check", "bypasses login"
* CWE relevance: authentication is usually mapped to CWE-306 or its children.

  * **CWE-306**: *Missing Authentication for Critical Function* – used when no identity validation is enforced for sensitive functionality (e.g., password reset, user deletion).

**Authorization**:
Determines *what* an authenticated actor is allowed to do. It decides access *after* identity is verified.

* Example phrases: "unauthorized access", "regular user can access admin panel", "role checks are missing"
* CWE relevance: use CWEs like 862, 863, 285 for authorization errors:

  * **CWE-862**: *Missing Authorization* – the application doesn't check whether the user is authorized at all.
  * **CWE-863**: *Incorrect Authorization* – the application checks authorization, but does it incorrectly (e.g., flawed logic).
  * **CWE-285**: *Improper Authorization* – general category for any flawed authorization logic or design.

**Access Control**:
A broader term that includes both authentication and authorization. Governs how resources are protected and who can access them under what conditions.

* CWE relevance:

  * **CWE-284**: *Improper Access Control* – top-level category used when access control failure exists but root cause is unclear.
  * This should be avoided **if** a more specific child CWE like 285, 862, 863, or 306 is appropriate.

## Mapping Discussion – Common Misclassification Patterns

### 1. **CWE-306 vs CWE-862**:

* **306** is about lack of **authentication** (e.g., *no login required at all*).
* **862** is about lack of **authorization** *after* authentication (e.g., *admin check missing*).
* ✅ Example CWE-306: *“An unauthenticated attacker can invoke the password reset API.”*
* ✅ Example CWE-862: *“An authenticated user without admin privileges can delete any user account.”*

### 2. **CWE-285 vs CWE-284**:

* **285** is specific to authorization flaws – it's a better choice than 284 **if** the issue involves *improper or missing role checks*.
* **284** should be reserved for general access control issues when it’s unclear whether the issue lies in authn or authz.

---

## Technical Impact vs Root Cause Clarification

**Phrase like "unauthorized access" is not enough.**

* If you **cannot determine whether identity was checked**, assume it’s **authorization** and consider 862 or 863.
* If you **know no login happened**, lean toward **authentication** → CWE-306.
* If the **access control policy is unclear or inconsistently enforced**, but it's not due to missing checks, consider **CWE-284**.

---

## Good Mapping Examples

* ✅ **CWE-306**: “The endpoint `/admin/deleteUser` does not require any authentication.”
* ✅ **CWE-862**: “Any logged-in user can change any other user's email without being an admin.”
* ✅ **CWE-863**: “An admin check exists but incorrectly grants access to non-admin users.”
* ✅ **CWE-285**: “Application uses a static role check that fails when roles change dynamically.”
* ✅ **CWE-284**: “Inconsistent enforcement of access rules across services with unclear policy source.”
