This could lead to data loss, system instability, and potentially denial of service.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- Network-based: The attacker exploits this vulnerability by connecting to remote services.\n- Exploitation of insecure deserialization.\n- Sending a maliciously crafted serialized temporary file collection.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- Authenticated access: The attacker needs valid credentials for an account with a role assigned in the \"Users and Roles\" settings of the Veeam Backup & Replication server.\n- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to connect to remote services from the affected system.\n\n**Summary:**\nCVE-2024-42455 describes a vulnerability in Veeam Backup & Replication where an authenticated user, with specific roles assigned, can exploit insecure deserialization via remote services to delete arbitrary files on the system.",

Supporting this, both the 'insecure deserialization' and 'insufficient blacklist' keyphrases map to this CWE. **CWE-184 Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs** is included as a secondary weakness because the vulnerability is caused by an **insufficient blacklist** during the deserialization process. **CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management** is listed because the low-privileged user can delete files using service account privileges, showing incorrect assignment, modification, tracking or checking of privileges for the attacker.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe502[\"CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"]\n    cwe184[\"CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs\"]\n    cwe269[\"CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\"]\n\n    cwe184 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe502\n    cwe269 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe502\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe502 primary\n    class cwe184,cwe269 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data** due to the **insecure deserialization** of the serialized temporary file collection. The **insufficient blacklist** during deserialization (**CWE-184 Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs**) allows a low-privileged user to exploit the **insecure deserialization**. This leads to the attacker deleting any file on the system with service account privileges, indicating **CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary focus of this vulnerability lies in the **insecure deserialization** aspect, making **CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data** the most appropriate primary CWE. The evidence for this includes the explicit mention of **insecure deserialization** in the vulnerability description and the high relevance scores in the keyphrase analysis. The **insufficient blacklist** further supports the inclusion of **CWE-184 Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs**. The fact that the low-privileged user can delete files with service account privileges leads to the inclusion of **CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management**. The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with **CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data** being a base-level CWE.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* While the vulnerability does lead to unauthorized actions, the root cause is not primarily about exposing sensitive information. The core issue is the **insecure deserialization** process that then allows for unauthorized file deletion.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* The vulnerability does not involve weak credentials being directly used or exploited.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* While the deserialization process does involve data, the lack of verification isn't the primary issue. The main problem is the **insecure deserialization** of the untrusted data, which allows for arbitrary code execution or other malicious actions.\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n*Not Selected:* This CWE is too generic. **CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data** is a more specific and appropriate classification.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* Authentication algorithms are not mentioned or implicated in the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* While file deletion is the impact, the vulnerability isn't related to improper link resolution.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence. Path equivalence involves the use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same object.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* Path equivalence is not mentioned or implicated in the vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
