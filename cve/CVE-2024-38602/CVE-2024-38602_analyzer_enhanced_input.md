# Vulnerability Description

    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ax25 Fix **reference count leak** issues of ax25_dev The ax25_addr_ax25dev() and ax25_dev_device_down() exist a **reference count leak** issue of the object ax25_dev. **Memory leak** issue in ax25_addr_ax25dev() The reference count of the object ax25_dev can be increased multiple times in ax25_addr_ax25dev(). This will cause a memory leak. **Memory leak** issues in ax25_dev_device_down() The reference count of ax25_dev is set to 1 in ax25_dev_device_up() and then increase the reference count when ax25_dev is added to ax25_dev_list. As a result, the reference count of ax25_dev is 2. But when the device is shutting down. The ax25_dev_device_down() drops the reference count once or twice depending on if we goto unlock_put or not, which will cause memory leak. As for the issue of ax25_addr_ax25dev(), it is impossible for one pointer to be on a list twice. So add a break in ax25_addr_ax25dev(). As for the issue of ax25_dev_device_down(), increase the reference count of ax25_dev once in ax25_dev_device_up() and decrease the reference count of ax25_dev after it is removed from the ax25_dev_list.

    ## WEAKNESS: 'Memory leak'

Relevant CWEs for this WEAKNESS:

### 1. CWE-911: Improper Update of Reference Count (Score: 1277.34)

The product uses a reference count to manage a resource, but it does not update or incorrectly updates the reference count....

### 2. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 1002.78)

The product performs a calculation that can
         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic
         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than
         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is
         incremented to a value that is too large to st...

### 3. CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime (Score: 1002.15)

The product does not sufficiently track and release allocated memory after it has been used, which slowly consumes remaining memory....

### 4. CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') (Score: 966.42)

The product contains a concurrent code sequence that requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence operating concurrently....
