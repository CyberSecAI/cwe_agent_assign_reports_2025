  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n- The vulnerability stems from the way Envoy's async HTTP client handles mirror responses. It buffers the entire response in memory without any limits, leading to potential out-of-memory (OOM) conditions.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**\n\n- **Unbounded Buffer:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of a size limit on the buffer used to store mirror responses. This allows a malicious backend to send extremely large responses, which will be fully buffered.\n- **Vulnerable Components:**  Multiple components within Envoy that utilize the HTTP async client are susceptible, including:\n    - wasm filter\n    - lua filter\n    - ext_proc\n    - oauth filter\n    - ext_authz\n    - jwks_fetcher\n    - gcp_auther_filter\n    - aws_metadata_fetcher\n    - opentelemetry/http_trace_exporter\n    - opentelemetry/dynatrace/sampler_config_provider\n    - config_subscription/rest/rest_api_fetcher\n    - rate_limiter\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering an out-of-memory error in Envoy.\n- **OOM:**  The Envoy process will be terminated due to excessive memory consumption.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n- **Malicious Backend:** A malicious backend server sending large HTTP response messages to a mirror service.\n- The vulnerability is network-based.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP responses to a service that is being mirrored by Envoy.\n- **Control over Mirrored Backend:** The attacker must have control of the backend service that is being mirrored, allowing them to send arbitrarily large responses.\n- **Low Privileges:** Low privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.\n- **User Interaction**: User interaction is required to initiate the request that triggers the mirroring.\n\n**Mitigation:**\n\n- **Disable Mirror Response Buffering:** Patched versions disable buffering for mirror responses, as Envoy does not use them.\n- **Configurable Buffer Limit:** Provide a configuration option for the HTTP async client that includes a hard limit on buffer size. This limit can be set through a runtime key.\n\n**CVSS Score:**\n- Moderate: 5.7\n- CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H",

This **unbounded buffer** allows a malicious backend to send large responses, leading to an out-of-memory condition.\n\nThe primary choice is CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling) because the core issue is the **lack of a limit on resource allocation**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" mentions \"*The primary vulnerability is the lack of a size limit on the buffer used to store mirror responses.*\"\n\nCWE-789 (Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value) is considered a secondary CWE because it describes the consequence of the primary issue i.e. the excessive memory allocation.\n\nThe other CWEs were not selected as they did not fit as well as CWE-770 and CWE-789. For instance, CWE-1284 (Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input) was considered but rejected because the vulnerability is not so much about improper validation as it is about the complete absence of limits. Similarly, CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) was deemed irrelevant because the description does not involve any integer overflow issues.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-941: Incorrectly Specified Destination in a Communication Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product creates a communication channel to initiate an outgoing request to an actor, but it does not correctly specify the intended destination for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.67\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.66\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.65\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.65\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.65\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
