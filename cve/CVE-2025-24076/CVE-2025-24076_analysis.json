CWE-285 is a more specific child of CWE-284, representing a particular type of access control issue where authorization is performed incorrectly. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**Improper access control**\", and based on the provided guidance, when authorization flaws are present, selecting CWE-285 is preferable to CWE-284.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    cwe266[\"CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\"]\n    cwe250[\"CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    cwe266 -->|PEEROF| cwe285\n    cwe250 -->|PEEROF| cwe285\n    cwe863 -->|PEEROF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe285 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper access control**, specifically authorization, which leads to the ability for an authorized attacker to elevate privileges locally.\n  - **Root Cause:** CWE-285 Improper Authorization\n  - **Impact:** Privilege escalation\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified several candidate CWEs, including CWE-269, CWE-284, CWE-285, and CWE-250. However, based on the vulnerability description's key phrase \"**Improper access control**\" and the fact that an authorized attacker can elevate privileges, CWE-285 (Improper Authorization) was selected as the primary CWE. The vulnerability description clearly states \"**Improper access control**\", indicating an issue with how access is managed. Given the guidance differentiating authentication, authorization, and access control, the authorization aspect is most prominent here.\n\nCWE-284 (Improper Access Control) remains a secondary consideration because it is a broader category. The description does not specify whether the issue is authentication or authorization, but since the attacker is authorized, authorization is the likely problem.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity. CWE-285 is a Class-level CWE, which is more specific than the Pillar-level CWE-284. The evidence supports this level of detail, as the description points to an authorization issue, not just a general access control problem. The \"Privileges vs Permissions Guidance\" also helped determine the most appropriate selection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Selected**: The description states \"authorized attacker\" which means the assignment of the privilege is not incorrect.\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n**Why Not Selected**: Insufficient information to determine if this is the case.\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Why Not Selected**: The description does not provide enough information to assess.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
