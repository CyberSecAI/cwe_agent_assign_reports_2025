The vulnerability description explicitly mentions **Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output** as the root cause, leading to **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**. This indicates a chain relationship where **CWE-116** can precede **CWE-79**. While **CWE-79** is a more specific Base level CWE, **CWE-116** is chosen as primary due to it being the root cause as stated in the vulnerability description.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe116[\"CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe116 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe116 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **CWE-116** (**Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output**), which is the **root cause**. This leads to **CWE-79** (**Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**), the **weakness**. The impact is Cross-Site Scripting, where an attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description clearly indicates that the root cause is **Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output**, leading to **Cross-Site Scripting**. The Retriever Results also confirm this, with **CWE-116** and **CWE-79** being the top candidates. The evidence from the vulnerability description key phrases, specifically \"**rootcause: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output**\" and \"**weakness: Cross-Site Scripting**\", directly supports this assessment. I am choosing **CWE-116** as the primary CWE because it is the **root cause** as stated in the description. **CWE-79** is the resulting weakness or impact. While **CWE-79** is more specific, **CWE-116** is a Class level weakness and may have more appropriate Base level children.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
