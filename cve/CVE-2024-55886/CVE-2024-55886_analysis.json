  "description": "OpenSearch Data Prepper is a component of the OpenSearch project that accepts, filters, transforms, enriches, and routes data at scale. A vulnerability exists in the OpenTelemetry Logs source in Data Prepper starting inversion 2.1.0 and prior to version 2.10.2 where some custom authentication plugins will not perform authentication. This allows unauthorized users to ingest OpenTelemetry Logs data under certain conditions. This vulnerability does not affect the built-in `http_basic` authentication provider in Data Prepper. Pipelines which use the `http_basic` authentication provider continue to require authentication. The vulnerability exists only for custom implementations of Data Preppers `GrpcAuthenticationProvider` authentication plugin which implement the `getHttpAuthenticationService()` method instead of `getAuthenticationInterceptor()`. Data Prepper 2.10.2 contains a fix for this issue. For those unable to upgrade, one may use the built-in `http_basic` authentication provider in Data Prepper and/or add an authentication proxy in front of ones Data Prepper instances running the OpenTelemetry Logs source.",

  "reference_content": "- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the OpenTelemetry Logs source in Data Prepper using custom authentication plugins that implement `getHttpAuthenticationService()` instead of `getAuthenticationInterceptor()`. This bypasses authentication for those plugins.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper authentication handling in custom plugins for the OpenTelemetry Logs source. Specifically, the use of `getHttpAuthenticationService()` instead of `getAuthenticationInterceptor()`.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized users can ingest OpenTelemetry Logs data. This allows unauthorized access to write to the OpenTelemetry Logs source endpoint leading to data integrity issues.\n- **Attack vectors:** Network access to the OpenTelemetry Logs source endpoint.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access and the system needs to be configured with a custom authentication provider using the vulnerable implementation. The attack has a high complexity and requires user interaction.",

While CWE-287 is a broader class, the evidence points to a specific case of missing authentication, making CWE-306 the more appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe306 primary\n    class cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe chain starts with the **improper authentication** mechanism. Specifically, the Data Prepper's OpenTelemetry Logs source uses custom authentication plugins that **do not perform authentication** because they implement the `getHttpAuthenticationService()` method instead of `getAuthenticationInterceptor()`. This leads to the impact: unauthorized users can ingest OpenTelemetry Logs data.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment strongly pointed towards an authentication issue. The vulnerability description clearly states that some custom authentication plugins **will not perform authentication**. The retriever results also listed CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function] and CWE-287 [Improper Authentication] as top candidates. The evidence supports that the product **does not perform any authentication** for functionality that requires a provable user identity.\n\nThe choice of CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function] is based on the following evidence:\n\n*   The vulnerability description states that **\"some custom authentication plugins will not perform authentication\"**.\n*   The CVE Reference Links Content Summary states that the root cause is that the custom plugins implement `getHttpAuthenticationService()` instead of `getAuthenticationInterceptor()`, which **bypasses authentication**.\n\nThe CWE-287 [Improper Authentication] was considered but not selected as the primary CWE because it is a more general class. The evidence points to a specific case of *missing* authentication, making CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function] the more appropriate and specific choice.\n\nThe selected CWE, CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function], is at the optimal level of specificity (Base) as it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability: **missing authentication** for a critical function.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* While authentication is involved, the core issue is the *absence* of authentication in certain configurations rather than an incorrect implementation of an existing algorithm.\n\n## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an authentication mechanism to restrict access to specific users or identities, but the mechanism does not sufficiently prove that the claimed identity is correct.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* While the authentication is \"weak\" in that it can be bypassed, CWE-306 [Missing Authentication for Critical Function] is more precise. The system *fails* to authenticate under certain conditions, rather than using a demonstrably weak method.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* The vulnerability is not due to the use of weak credentials.\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It might have lower-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n*Not Selected:* The primary issue is missing authentication, not insufficient verification of data authenticity.\n\n## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* Authorization is not the primary issue. The system fails to authenticate users.\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This CWE is not relevant as it deals with the removal of sensitive information, which is not the issue here.\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This CWE is not relevant to the described vulnerability.\n\n## CWE-538: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Externally-Accessible File or Directory\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product places sensitive information into files or directories that are accessible to actors who are allowed to have access to the files, but not to the sensitive information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* This CWE is not relevant as it deals with the placement of sensitive information, which is not the issue here.\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* The issue is not primarily about exposure of sensitive system information.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**",
