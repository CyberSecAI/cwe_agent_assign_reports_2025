While CWE-285 is a broader category, the vulnerability description explicitly mentions a **lack of runtime capability validation**, which directly implies that authorization checks are missing altogether. Therefore, CWE-862 is the more specific and appropriate choice. There isn't a clear chain relationship, but rather a lack of a necessary security control.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is relatively simple:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Lack of runtime capability validation** (CWE-862)\n2.  **Impact:** Attackers can execute unauthorized actions on the blockchain.\n\nThe primary weakness is the missing authorization.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The description clearly states a **lack of runtime capability validation**, leading to the selection of CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) as the primary CWE.\n\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization) was considered but deemed less specific, as it implies that authorization checks are present but flawed, whereas the vulnerability description suggests that such checks are missing entirely.\n\nThe decision is based on the explicit statement in the vulnerability description regarding the **lack of runtime capability validation**. This directly supports the selection of CWE-862.\n\nThe selected CWE is at the Class level of specificity, offering a balance between generality and detail. While more specific variants might exist, the available evidence does not definitively point to any particular type of missing authorization.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* Authentication is not mentioned, authorization is.\n\n## CWE-1289: Improper Validation of Unsafe Equivalence in Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives an input value that is used as a resource identifier or other type of reference, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input is equivalent to a potentially-unsafe value.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n*Not Selected:* There is no mention of input validation for equivalence.\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.

Shadow registers and mirror registers typically refer to registers that can be accessed from multiple addresses. Writing to or reading from the aliased/mirrored address has the same effect as writing to the address of the main register. They are typically implemented within an IP core or SoC to temporarily hold certain data. These data will later be updated to the main register, and both registers will be in synch.
