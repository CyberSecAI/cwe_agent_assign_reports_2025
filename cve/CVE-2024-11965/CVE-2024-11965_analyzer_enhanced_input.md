## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11965 (Based on the GitHub issue, this is a claim. The content does not have the official CVE ID description).

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `reset-password.php` file of the "Complaint Management System" version 1.0.
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `email` parameter. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can insert malicious SQL code to manipulate database queries.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, specifically the `email` parameter, before using it in SQL queries.
- **Direct use of user input in SQL queries:** The application directly uses the user-provided email in SQL queries without proper escaping or prepared statements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can access and exfiltrate sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **System Control:** Attackers can potentially gain control of the entire system.
- **Service Disruption:** Attackers can cause a disruption of service, making the application unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/user/reset-password.php` endpoint.
- **Email Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `email` parameter.
- **Malicious SQL Payload:**  Attackers inject malicious SQL code within the email parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server.
- No login or prior authorization is needed to exploit this vulnerability, making it easily accessible.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates both boolean-based and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.
- The following payloads are mentioned:
    - `email=-8429' OR 2277=2277 OR 'XSsm'='yJbA&mobileno=111&newpassword=qqq&confirmpassword=qqq&resetpwd=` (boolean-based blind)
    - `email=11@qq.com' AND (SELECT 6691 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))uDaT) OR 'mFBs'='zHAV&mobileno=111&newpassword=qqq&confirmpassword=qqq&resetpwd=` (time-based blind)
- The sqlmap tool was used to test the vulnerability with parameters like `--level=5 --risk=3 --dbms=mysql --random-agent --tamper=space2comment`.

**Suggested Repairs:**
- **Prepared Statements:** Use prepared statements and parameter binding to separate SQL code from user input.
- **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation and filtering to ensure user-provided data conforms to the expected format.
- **Least Privilege:** Minimize database user permissions by using an account with only the necessary permissions for database operations.
- **Security Audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**
- The affected software is "Complaint Management system" V1.0, and a link to download it is provided: `<https://phpgurukul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Complaint-Management-System-PHP.zip>`.
- The vulnerability is located in the file `/user/reset-password.php`.
