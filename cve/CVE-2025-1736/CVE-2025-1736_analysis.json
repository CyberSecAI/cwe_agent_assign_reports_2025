Verification against CVE Description:**\n\nThe content directly relates to CVE-2025-1736 as it explicitly states the CVE ID.\n\n**2. Extracted Information:**\n\n*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The header check in `check_has_header` does not verify `\\r` (carriage return), potentially leading to misbehavior if only `\\n` (newline) is used in the header value. This allows manipulation of headers, specifically the authorization header.\n*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper header validation, specifically lacking carriage return (`\\r`) verification. This can lead to header injection or manipulation.\n*   **Impact of exploitation:** Preventing the authorization header from being sent, potentially leading to Denial of Service (DoS) or unexpected issues.  There are also potential implications for other headers like user-agent.\n*   **Attack vectors:**  Crafting a malicious header value (e.g., in a cookie) containing both `\\n` and `\\r` to manipulate header parsing and potentially disable authorization.\n*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to control or influence the HTTP headers sent to the server, potentially through user input or a crafted request.\n*   **Mitigation or fix:** Upgrade to PHP versions 8.1.32, 8.2.28, 8.3.19, or 8.4.5, which include the fix for this vulnerability.\n*   **Affected versions:** PHP versions less than 8.1.32, 8.2.28, 8.3.18, and 8.4.5.\n*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-1736\n*   **Severity:** Moderate\n\n**3. Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, explaining the technical root cause and potential impact.\n*   The advisory mentions the lack of CWEs (Common Weakness Enumerations) associated with this vulnerability.\n*   The advisory is published by the PHP project on GitHub.\n\n**4. Unrelated Content:**\n\nThe content from `security.netapp.com` is unrelated and was ignored. The content from `docs.github.com` is general GitHub policy and terms of service and does not contain information about the vulnerability.",

CWE-113 is more specific than its parents, accurately representing the HTTP header context of the vulnerability. CWE-1286 is a peer weakness that represents the **insufficient validation** aspect of the vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe113[\"CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\"]\n    cwe93[\"CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe1286[\"CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\"]\n    \n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe93\n    cwe113 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe113 primary\n    class cwe93,cwe20,cwe1286 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient validation** of end-of-line characters (CWE-1286). This leads to the improper neutralization of CRLF sequences in HTTP headers (CWE-113), which then allows for header manipulation and potentially prevents headers from being sent.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided evidence, which clearly states the **insufficient validation of end-of-line characters** as the root cause. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section confirms that the header check does not verify `\\r` (carriage return), leading to potential misbehavior. This directly aligns with CWE-113 (Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')), which is a Variant-level CWE and thus more specific than its parent CWEs.\n\nCWE-1286 (Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input) is included as a secondary CWE to represent the root cause of the vulnerability - the **insufficient validation**. This represents the lack of proper input sanitization that leads to the exploitable condition.\n\nThe selection of CWE-113 is supported by its high relevance score in the Retriever Results and the MITRE mapping guidance, which allows its usage.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an HTTP agent/component (e.g., web server, proxy, browser, etc.), but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CR and LF characters before the data is included in outgoing HTTP headers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n\n\n## CWE-93: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses CRLF (carriage return line feeds) as a special element, e.g. to separate lines or records, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes CRLF sequences from inputs.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
