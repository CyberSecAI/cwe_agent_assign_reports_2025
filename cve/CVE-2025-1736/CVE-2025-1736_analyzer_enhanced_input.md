## Vulnerability Description
In PHP from 8.1.* before 8.1.32, from 8.2.* before 8.2.28, from 8.3.* before 8.3.19, from 8.4.* before 8.4.5, when user-supplied headers are sent, the **insufficient validation** of the end-of-line characters may prevent certain headers from being sent or lead to certain headers be misinterpreted.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **insufficient validation of end-of-line characters**
- **weakness:** **insufficient validation**
- **impact:** prevent headers from being sent
- **product:** PHP
- **version:** ['8.1.* before 8.1.32' and '8.2.* before 8.2.28' and '8.3.* before 8.3.19' and '8.4.* before 8.4.5']

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-1736 based on provided content:

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the provided content, adhering to the guidelines:

**1. Verification against CVE Description:**

The content directly relates to CVE-2025-1736 as it explicitly states the CVE ID.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The header check in `check_has_header` does not verify `\r` (carriage return), potentially leading to misbehavior if only `\n` (newline) is used in the header value. This allows manipulation of headers, specifically the authorization header.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper header validation, specifically lacking carriage return (`\r`) verification. This can lead to header injection or manipulation.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Preventing the authorization header from being sent, potentially leading to Denial of Service (DoS) or unexpected issues.  There are also potential implications for other headers like user-agent.
*   **Attack vectors:**  Crafting a malicious header value (e.g., in a cookie) containing both `\n` and `\r` to manipulate header parsing and potentially disable authorization.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to control or influence the HTTP headers sent to the server, potentially through user input or a crafted request.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** Upgrade to PHP versions 8.1.32, 8.2.28, 8.3.19, or 8.4.5, which include the fix for this vulnerability.
*   **Affected versions:** PHP versions less than 8.1.32, 8.2.28, 8.3.18, and 8.4.5.
*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-1736
*   **Severity:** Moderate

**3. Additional Notes:**

*   The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, explaining the technical root cause and potential impact.
*   The advisory mentions the lack of CWEs (Common Weakness Enumerations) associated with this vulnerability.
*   The advisory is published by the PHP project on GitHub.

**4. Unrelated Content:**

The content from `security.netapp.com` is unrelated and was ignored. The content from `docs.github.com` is general GitHub policy and terms of service and does not contain information about the vulnerability.
