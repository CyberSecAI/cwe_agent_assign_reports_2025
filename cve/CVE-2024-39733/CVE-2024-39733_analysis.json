It's directly related to the vulnerability description, which states that user credentials are stored in plain clear text. CWE-256 is a child of CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials), which is a class-level CWE. CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) is a parent of several CWEs, which indicates it can manifest in multiple ways.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe256[\"CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password\"]\n    cwe522[\"CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials\"]\n    cwe312[\"CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information\"]\n\n    cwe256 -->|CHILDOF| cwe522\n    cwe256 -->|CANALSOBE| cwe312\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe256 primary\n    class cwe522,cwe312 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Plaintext Storage of User Credentials** (CWE-256)\n2.  **Impact:** Exposure of user credentials to a local user.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-256 as the most appropriate CWE because the vulnerability description states the root cause is \"**stores user credentials in plain clear text**\". The retriever results also listed CWE-256 as the second-best option.\n\nCWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) is the most specific and directly applicable CWE. It accurately reflects the core issue: passwords are being stored without any form of encryption or hashing. This directly violates security best practices and exposes the credentials to unauthorized access.\n\nThe relationship graph shows that CWE-256 is a child of CWE-522, meaning it's a more specific type of credential protection failure.\n\nCWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information) could also apply since passwords can be considered sensitive information. However, CWE-256 is more specific, as it explicitly addresses passwords.\n\nTherefore, CWE-256 is the primary CWE because it directly addresses the **root cause**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
