## Vulnerability Description
A **buffer overflow** flaw was found in X.Org and Xwayland. If XkbChangeTypesOfKey() is called with a 0 group, it will resize the key symbols table to 0 but leave the key actions unchanged. If the same function is later called with a non-zero value of groups, this will cause a **buffer overflow** because the key actions are of the wrong size.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **buffer overflow**
- **product:** X.Org and Xwayland
- **component:** XkbChangeTypesOfKey()
