  "description": "A vulnerability classified as critical was found in AMTT Hotel Broadband Operation System 1.0. This vulnerability affects the function popen of the file /manager/network/port_setup.php. The manipulation of the argument SwitchVersion/SwitchWrite/SwitchIP/SwitchIndex/SwitchState leads to **os command injection**. The attack can be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
