# Analysis Report for CVE-2024-9307

# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2024-9307

## Description

The mFolio Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to file uploads due to a **missing capability check** in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file or upload arbitrary EXE files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible if the attacker can also gain access to run the .exe file, or trick a site visitor into downloading and running the .exe file.

## Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **Rootcause:** missing capability check
- **Impact:** ['arbitrary file upload', 'inject arbitrary web scripts', 'remote code execution']
- **Attacker:** authenticated attackers with Author-level access and above
- **Product:** mFolio Lite plugin for WordPress
- **Version:** up to and including 1.2.1

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary

| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-862 | Missing Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-434 | Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type | 0.8 | Base | Secondary Candidate | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.85
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is **CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]**, indicating a fundamental flaw in access control. **CWE-434 [Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type]** stems directly from the **missing authorization**, representing a specific manifestation of the broader authorization failure.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **missing capability check (CWE-862 [Missing Authorization])** which allows authenticated users with insufficient privileges (Author-level access and above) to upload arbitrary files. This **unrestricted file upload (CWE-434 [Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type])** leads to the potential injection of arbitrary web scripts and remote code execution.
  - The chain starts with **missing authorization**, which leads to arbitrary file upload, which leads to potential remote code execution.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the vulnerability description, which clearly states a **missing capability check**. This aligns perfectly with **CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]**. The ability to upload arbitrary files, including dangerous types like .exe and .svg, directly results from this **missing authorization**, making **CWE-434 [Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type]** a secondary, but important, consequence.

The retriever results support these choices, with both CWEs appearing in the top results. The graph relationships also show how these vulnerabilities can be chained.

I am choosing **CWE-862 [Missing Authorization]** as the primary because the description mentions **missing capability check** as the root cause.
I am choosing **CWE-434 [Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type]** as the secondary because it is a consequence of the **missing capability check**.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allows the upload or transfer of dangerous file types that are automatically processed within its environment.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Abstraction Level**: Compound
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.



## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-95: Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g. "eval").

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly. As a result, the intended structure of the message is not preserved.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review

## CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.69
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
