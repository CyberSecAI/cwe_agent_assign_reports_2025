## Vulnerability Description
Account users in Apache CloudStack by default are allowed to upload and register templates for deploying instances and volumes for attaching them as data disks to their existing instances. Due to **missing validation checks** for KVM-compatible templates or volumes in CloudStack 4.0.0 through 4.18.2.3 and 4.19.0.0 through 4.19.1.1, an attacker that can upload or register templates and volumes, can use them to deploy malicious instances or attach uploaded volumes to their existing instances on KVM-based environments and exploit this to gain access to the host filesystems that could result in the compromise of resource integrity and confidentiality, data loss, denial of service, and availability of KVM-based infrastructure managed by CloudStack. Users are recommended to upgrade to Apache CloudStack 4.18.2.4 or 4.19.1.2, or later, which addresses this issue. Additionally, all user-uploaded or registered KVM-compatible templates and volumes can be scanned and checked that they are flat files that should not be using any additional or unnecessary features. For example, operators can run this on their secondary storage(s) and inspect output. An empty output for the disk being validated means it has no references to the host filesystems on the other hand, if the output for the disk being validated is not empty, it might indicate a compromised disk. for file in $(find /path/to/storage/ -type f -regex [a-f0-9\-]*.*) do echo Retrieving file [$file] info. If the output is not empty

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

- **impact:** availability and compromise of resource integrity and confidentiality and data loss and denial of service and gain access to host filesystems
- **vector:** upload or register templates and volumes
- **product:** Apache CloudStack
- **version:** 4.0.0 through 4.18.2.3 and 4.19.0.0 through 4.19.1.1

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45219:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- Missing validation checks for KVM-compatible templates or volumes when they are uploaded or registered by users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Insufficient input validation: The system doesn't properly check the uploaded or registered templates/volumes for malicious content or features that could be used to exploit the underlying infrastructure.
- Unrestricted file upload: Default user permissions allow uploading and registering templates/volumes without adequate security measures.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Compromise of resource integrity and confidentiality:** Attackers can gain access to the host filesystems.
- **Data loss:** Potential data corruption or deletion.
- **Denial of service:** Malicious instances can cause system instability or resource exhaustion.
- **Compromise of KVM-based infrastructure:** Full control over the virtualized environment.

**Attack vectors:**

- Uploading or registering malicious templates: Users can upload specially crafted disk images disguised as templates.
- Uploading or registering malicious volumes: Users can upload malicious data volumes that can be attached to instances.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- An attacker needs to have a regular user account within CloudStack, which grants them permissions to upload and register templates/volumes.
- The attacker must be in a KVM based environment.

**Additional details:**

- The advisory suggests scanning all user-uploaded or registered KVM-compatible templates and volumes to ensure they are flat files without any additional or unnecessary features.
- Example `qemu-img` commands are provided to check for references to the host filesystem, and to retrieve general file information.
- The vulnerability affects Apache CloudStack versions 4.0.0 through 4.18.2.3 and 4.19.0.0 through 4.19.1.1.
- Upgrading to version 4.18.2.4 or 4.19.1.2 or later is recommended.
