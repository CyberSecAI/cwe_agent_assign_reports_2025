CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77, indicating that it is a more specific type of command injection that occurs at the OS level. The vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"OS **command injection**\", justifying the selection of the more specific CWE-78.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper neutralization** of special elements within a command, leading to OS **command injection**. This allows an authenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment, based on the vulnerability description, identified OS **command injection** as the primary issue. The retriever results and graph relationships support this assessment. CWE-78 is the most specific and appropriate CWE, as it directly addresses the **improper neutralization** of special elements in OS commands. The evidence is strong, with the vulnerability description explicitly mentioning \"OS **command injection** vulnerabilities\".\n\nThe selection of CWE-78 is justified by its specificity and the explicit mention of OS commands.
