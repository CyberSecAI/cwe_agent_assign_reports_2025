CWE-200 is a child of CWE-284. While CWE-284 is a high-level Pillar, the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor,\" aligning directly with CWE-200.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe200 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves an authenticated user gaining adjacent access, leading to the exposure of sensitive information due to **improper access control**.\n\nRoot Cause: **Improper Access Control** (CWE-284) leading to\nImpact: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary choice is CWE-200 because the vulnerability description and CVE summary explicitly state \"Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor\". While CWE-200 is a Class and discouraged, the available evidence doesn't allow for mapping to a more specific Base or Variant CWE. The root cause is the **improper access control** that allows an authenticated user with adjacent access to expose sensitive information.\n\nThe analysis relies heavily on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference summary. The selection of CWE-200 is based on the direct match with the stated vulnerability, with CWE-284 representing a broader, less specific categorization of the underlying issue.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.81\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
