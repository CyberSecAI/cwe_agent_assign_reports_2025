## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ASoC mediatek Check num_codecs is not zero to avoid panic during probe Following commit 13f58267cda3 (ASoC soc.h dont create dummy Component via COMP_DUMMY()), COMP_DUMMY() became an array with zero length, and only gets populated with the dummy struct after the card is registered. Since the sound card drivers probe happens before the card registration, accessing any of the members of a dummy component during probe will result in undefined behavior. This can be observed in the mt8188 and mt8195 machine sound drivers. By omitting a dai link subnode in the sound cards node in the Devicetree, the default uninitialized dummy codec is used, and when its dai_name pointer gets passed to strcmp() it results in a null pointer dereference and a kernel panic. In addition to that, set_card_codec_info() in the generic helpers file, mtk-soundcard-driver.c, will populate a dai link with a dummy codec when a dai link node is present in DT but with no codec property. The result is that at probe time, a dummy codec can either be uninitialized with num_codecs = 0, or be an initialized dummy codec, with num_codecs = 1 and dai_name = snd-soc-dummy-dai. In order to accommodate for both situations, check that num_codecs is not zero before accessing the codecs fields but still check for the codecs dai name against snd-soc-dummy-dai as needed. While at it, also drop the check that dai_name is not null in the mt8192 driver, introduced in commit 4d4e1b6319e5 (ASoC mediatek mt8192 Check existence of dai_name before dereferencing), as it is actually redundant given the preceding num_codecs != 0 check.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **accessing members of dummy component during probe before registration**
- **vector:** omitting dai link subnode
- **weakness:** **array with zero length, null pointer dereference, undefined behavior**
- **product:** ['Linux kernel', 'mt8188', 'mt8195', 'mt8192']
- **impact:** kernel panic

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a change introduced by commit `13f58267cda3` ("ASoC: soc.h: don't create dummy Component via COMP_DUMMY()"). This commit modified how dummy components are handled, resulting in `COMP_DUMMY()` becoming a zero-length array that is only populated after the sound card is registered.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:**  Sound card drivers (specifically `mt8188` and `mt8195`) access members of dummy components during the probe phase, which occurs *before* the card registration. Due to the change mentioned above, the dummy codec can be uninitialized ( `num_codecs = 0`), or initialized, with `num_codecs = 1` and `dai_name = "snd-soc-dummy-dai"`. Accessing fields like `dai_name` of an uninitialized dummy component results in a null pointer dereference and a kernel panic.
- **Inconsistent Handling of Dummy Codecs:** The `set_card_codec_info()` function in `mtk-soundcard-driver.c` can also populate a DAI link with a dummy codec when the Device Tree (DT) contains a DAI link node, but without a codec property.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Panic:** A null pointer dereference during the probe phase of sound card drivers leads to a kernel panic. This causes a denial-of-service, as the system becomes unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Device Tree Manipulation:** An attacker could craft a Device Tree (DT) that omits a codec property for a DAI link node. This would force the use of the uninitialized dummy codec, triggering the null pointer dereference.
- **Missing DAI Link Subnodes**: Omitting a DAI link subnode in the sound card's node within the Device Tree leads to the usage of the uninitialized dummy codec.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Modify Device Tree:** The attacker needs the capability to modify the device tree used by the system. This could be achieved via local access or, in some cases, remote exploitation if the system is configured to load untrusted device trees.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was observed in the `mt8188` and `mt8195` machine sound drivers.
- The fix involves checking if `num_codecs` is not zero before accessing codec fields, and retaining the check for `dai_name` against "snd-soc-dummy-dai".
- The patch also removes the redundant null `dai_name` check in the `mt8192` driver.

This analysis provides more detail than a simple placeholder description of the CVE would contain, by extracting the root cause, weakness, impact, attack vectors and required attacker capabilities from the provided patch information.
