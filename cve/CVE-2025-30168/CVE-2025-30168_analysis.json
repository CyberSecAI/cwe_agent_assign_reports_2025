  "description": "Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to 7.5.2 and 8.0.2, the 3rd party authentication handling of Parse Server allows the authentication credentials of some specific authentication providers to be used across multiple Parse Server apps. For example, if a user signed up using the same authentication provider in two unrelated Parse Server apps, the credentials stored by one app can be used to authenticate the same user in the other app. Note that this only affects Parse Server apps that specifically use an affected 3rd party authentication provider for user authentication, for example by setting the Parse Server option auth to configure a Parse Server authentication adapter. The fix of this vulnerability requires to upgrade Parse Server to a version that includes the bug fix, as well as upgrade the client app to send a secure payload, which is different from the previous insecure payload. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.2 and 8.0.2.",

CWE-306 is a child of CWE-287. The analysis leans towards the more general CWE-287 because the vulnerability involves a general failure to properly authenticate users across different Parse Server apps when using specific 3rd party authentication providers. CWE-639 is considered as a potential alternative due to the possibility of user-controlled keys being manipulated to bypass authorization.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe639[\"CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\"]\n    \n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe287 primary\n    class cwe306,cwe639 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper authentication** handling in Parse Server, leading to the potential use of authentication credentials across multiple apps, and ultimately resulting in unauthorized access to user data.\n  - The chain of root cause and weaknesses that followed for the Vulnerability Description is:\n  - **Improper Authentication** (CWE-287) -> Use of authentication credentials across multiple apps -> Unauthorized access to user data\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment considered CWE-287 as the primary weakness due to the **improper authentication** handling in Parse Server. The evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary explicitly mentions that the vulnerability lies in the authentication handling of Parse Server, allowing credentials to be used across apps. This aligns with the description of CWE-287, which involves a failure to properly prove a user's claimed identity. The selection is further justified by the vulnerability description key phrases, which highlight the impact on authentication credentials.\n\nThe retriever results also support this selection, with CWE-287 being listed as a potentially relevant CWE. However, its Usage is \"Discouraged\" indicating lower-level CWE entries might be applicable.\nCWE-639 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key, was considered because the vulnerability might allow the attacker to modify a key value identifying the data.\n\nThe final decision is to use CWE-287 as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, which is the **improper authentication** handling that allows credentials to be used across multiple apps.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not sufficiently verify the origin or authenticity of data, in a way that causes it to accept invalid data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
