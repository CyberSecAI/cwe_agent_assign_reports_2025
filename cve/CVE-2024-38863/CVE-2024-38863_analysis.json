This can lead to the token being saved in bookmarks or shared unintentionally.\n- **Impact of exploitation**: The leaked token, while not an immediate security threat, could potentially enable phishing attacks targeting the specific user for the duration of the token's validity. A successful phishing attack could allow an attacker to impersonate the user and perform actions as that user.\n- **Attack vectors**:\n    - Unintentional exposure via sharing bookmarks or URLs containing the CSRF token.\n    - Phishing attacks targeting users with leaked CSRF tokens.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:\n    - The attacker needs to acquire a leaked CSRF token. This can happen through social engineering (phishing) or via leaked bookmarks.\n    - The attacker needs to target a user within the validity of the leaked token (session duration).\n    - The attacker needs to trick the user into visiting a malicious site with the user's valid CSRF token, which allows the attacker to perform actions on the user's behalf.\n\nThe provided information includes a CVSS score (2.0 Low), and details specific affected versions of Checkmk. It also provides mitigations and confirms the issue was found during internal review.",

CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission) is a related concern, as the GET request exposes the token in the URL, which can be transmitted in cleartext. CWE-352 is related since the CSRF token is intended to prevent CSRF attacks, but its exposure weakens this defense. CWE-201 is a more general case of sensitive data exposure. The relationships indicate a progression from the specific coding practice (GET with sensitive data) to the potential security impacts (cleartext transmission, CSRF vulnerability). Abstraction levels guided the choice to prioritize the more specific CWE-598 while acknowledging the relevance of broader categories.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe598[\"CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method With Sensitive Query Strings\"]\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe201[\"CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data\"]\n\n    cwe598 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe319\n    cwe598 -->|MITIGATES| cwe352\n    cwe598 -->|CHILDOF| cwe201\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe598 primary\n    class cwe319,cwe352,cwe201 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **exposure of CSRF tokens in query parameters**. This leads to a potential **leak of the token**. The impact of the leak is that it **facilitates targeted phishing attacks**. The root cause is the **inclusion of the CSRF token as a query parameter in certain URLs**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the provided evidence which specifically states: \"**Exposure of CSRF tokens in query parameters**\" and \"The CSRF token was mistakenly included as a query parameter in certain URLs when navigating Checkmk.\". This aligns directly with CWE-598. The relationships highlight that this issue can lead to broader security concerns like cleartext transmission and increased risk of CSRF attacks, justifying the inclusion of CWE-319 and CWE-352 as secondary CWEs.
