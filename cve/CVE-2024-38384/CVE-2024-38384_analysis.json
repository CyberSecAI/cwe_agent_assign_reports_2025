  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved blk-cgroup fix list corruption from **reorder of WRITE ->lqueued __blkcg_rstat_flush() can be run anytime**, especially when blk_cgroup_bio_start is being executed. If WRITE of `->lqueued` is re-ordered with READ of bisc->lnode.next in the loop of __blkcg_rstat_flush(), `next_bisc` can be assigned with one stat instance being added in blk_cgroup_bio_start(), then the local list in __blkcg_rstat_flush() could be corrupted. Fix the issue by adding one barrier.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability is due to a race condition in the `__blkcg_rstat_flush()` function within the Linux kernel's block cgroup implementation. Specifically, the write to `->lqueued` and the read of `bisc->lnode.next` in the loop of `__blkcg_rstat_flush()` could be reordered by the CPU.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Race condition:** A race condition exists between `__blkcg_rstat_flush()` and `blk_cgroup_bio_start()`.\n- **Memory corruption:** If the write to `->lqueued` is reordered with the read of `bisc->lnode.next`, `next_bisc` could be assigned a stat instance that was added in `blk_cgroup_bio_start()`, leading to a corrupted local list in `__blkcg_rstat_flush()`.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **List corruption:** The primary impact is the corruption of the list used by `__blkcg_rstat_flush()`, which could lead to unpredictable behavior and potentially a system crash.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The vulnerability is triggered when `__blkcg_rstat_flush()` is executed concurrently with `blk_cgroup_bio_start()`. Specifically when I/O operations are performed on a block device under cgroup control.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs the ability to trigger I/O operations on a block device under cgroup control to cause the race condition and list corruption. This could be a user with the ability to create and manage cgroups and initiate I/O operations on block devices.\n\n**More details than CVE description:**\nThe provided content provides detailed information regarding:\n- The specific code functions involved `__blkcg_rstat_flush()` and `blk_cgroup_bio_start()`.\n- How the reordering of memory operations leads to the vulnerability.\n- The fix involves adding a memory barrier (`smp_mb()`) to ensure proper ordering of operations.",

While CWE-367 (Time-of-check Time-of-use Race Condition) is a more specific Base-level weakness, the description focuses on the general concurrent execution and synchronization issues rather than a specific TOCTOU scenario. CWE-787 is included as a secondary CWE because the **list corruption** can lead to an out-of-bounds write scenario, but the root cause is the race condition.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|RESULT_OF| cwe362\n    cwe667 -->|CHILD_OF| cwe362\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe362 primary\n    class cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe667 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **reorder of WRITE** operations in `__blkcg_rstat_flush()` due to the race condition (CWE-362). This leads to **list corruption**, which can be considered as a form of out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).\n\nCWE-362 (Improper Synchronization) -> CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly supports CWE-362 as the primary weakness, given the clear indication of a race condition in the description: \"**reorder of WRITE ->lqueued __blkcg_rstat_flush() can be run anytime**\". The memory corruption resulting from the race condition is mapped to CWE-787. The retriever results also highlight CWE-362 and related race condition CWEs as potential candidates.\n\nThe description clearly points to a concurrency issue where shared resources are accessed without proper synchronization, leading to data corruption.
