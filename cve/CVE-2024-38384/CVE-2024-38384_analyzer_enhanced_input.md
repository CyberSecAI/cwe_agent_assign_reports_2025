## Vulnerability Description
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved blk-cgroup fix list corruption from **reorder of WRITE ->lqueued __blkcg_rstat_flush() can be run anytime**, especially when blk_cgroup_bio_start is being executed. If WRITE of `->lqueued` is re-ordered with READ of bisc->lnode.next in the loop of __blkcg_rstat_flush(), `next_bisc` can be assigned with one stat instance being added in blk_cgroup_bio_start(), then the local list in __blkcg_rstat_flush() could be corrupted. Fix the issue by adding one barrier.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **reorder of WRITE ->lqueued __blkcg_rstat_flush() can be run anytime**
- **impact:** list corruption
- **vector:** WRITE of `->lqueued` is re-ordered with READ of bisc->lnode.next in the loop of __blkcg_rstat_flush()
- **product:** Linux kernel
- **component:** blk-cgroup

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a race condition in the `__blkcg_rstat_flush()` function within the Linux kernel's block cgroup implementation. Specifically, the write to `->lqueued` and the read of `bisc->lnode.next` in the loop of `__blkcg_rstat_flush()` could be reordered by the CPU.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Race condition:** A race condition exists between `__blkcg_rstat_flush()` and `blk_cgroup_bio_start()`.
- **Memory corruption:** If the write to `->lqueued` is reordered with the read of `bisc->lnode.next`, `next_bisc` could be assigned a stat instance that was added in `blk_cgroup_bio_start()`, leading to a corrupted local list in `__blkcg_rstat_flush()`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **List corruption:** The primary impact is the corruption of the list used by `__blkcg_rstat_flush()`, which could lead to unpredictable behavior and potentially a system crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when `__blkcg_rstat_flush()` is executed concurrently with `blk_cgroup_bio_start()`. Specifically when I/O operations are performed on a block device under cgroup control.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to trigger I/O operations on a block device under cgroup control to cause the race condition and list corruption. This could be a user with the ability to create and manage cgroups and initiate I/O operations on block devices.

**More details than CVE description:**
The provided content provides detailed information regarding:
- The specific code functions involved `__blkcg_rstat_flush()` and `blk_cgroup_bio_start()`.
- How the reordering of memory operations leads to the vulnerability.
- The fix involves adding a memory barrier (`smp_mb()`) to ensure proper ordering of operations.
