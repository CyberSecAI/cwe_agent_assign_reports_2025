  "query": "A vulnerability classified as problematic has been found in Consumer Comanda Mobile up to 14.9.3.2/15.0.0.8. This affects an unknown part of the component Restaurant Order Handler. The manipulation of the argument Login/Password leads to cleartext transmission of sensitive information. The attack can only be initiated within the local network. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.",
