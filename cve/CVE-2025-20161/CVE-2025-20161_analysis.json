  "description": "A vulnerability in the software upgrade process of Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode could allow an authenticated, local attacker with valid Administrator credentials to execute a **command injection** attack on the underlying operating system of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to **insufficient validation of specific elements within a software image**. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by installing a crafted image. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with root privileges.&nbsp Note Administrators should validate the hash of any software image before installation.",

The vulnerability involves injecting commands into the OS, making CWE-78 a direct and specific fit. CWE-20 is a class-level CWE that represents a broader category of input validation issues. It is considered as a possible secondary CWE because the **insufficient validation of specific elements within a software image** led to the command injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe78 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **insufficient validation of specific elements within a software image** leading to **command injection**, ultimately allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with root privileges.\n  - Root Cause: **Insufficient validation of specific elements within a software image** (Implied CWE-20)\n  - Weakness: **Command Injection** (CWE-78)\n  - Impact: Arbitrary command execution with root privileges.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis strongly supports CWE-78 as the primary CWE due to the direct evidence of **command injection**. The **insufficient validation of specific elements within a software image** is the root cause, and while there isn't a specific CWE assigned to this **insufficient validation**, it is implied that CWE-20 could be a secondary candidate due to its broader applicability to input validation issues.\n\nThe evidence directly states: \"This vulnerability is due to **insufficient validation of specific elements within a software image**.\" and \"An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by installing a crafted image. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with root privileges.\"\n\nThe graph relationships help show how the command injection (CWE-78) is a specific type of command injection (CWE-77) and how it could be preceded by improper input validation (CWE-20).\n\nCWE-78 is selected as the primary CWE because it is the most specific and accurate representation of the vulnerability based on the provided evidence. CWE-20 is a secondary consideration because it is a broader category that encompasses the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-280: Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges \n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to access resources or functionality as specified by their permissions.
