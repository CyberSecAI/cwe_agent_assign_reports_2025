This implies an attacker could trigger the vulnerability by enticing a user to open a specially crafted malicious PDF file, or by delivering the file through a malicious website.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n*   The attacker would need to be able to cause the browser to attempt to process a specially crafted PDF document. This could be achieved through social engineering, or by hosting the malicious file on a website.",
