The vulnerability description clearly states that the root cause is a **TOCTOU**, which leads to an **out-of-bounds write**, CWE-787.\n\nThe evidence is strong, with the description and CVE summary both pointing to the **TOCTOU** as the root cause and **out-of-bounds write** as a consequence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
