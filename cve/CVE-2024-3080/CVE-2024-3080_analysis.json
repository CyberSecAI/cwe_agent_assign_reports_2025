CWE-287 is a Class-level CWE, representing a more general case of **improper authentication**, of which CWE-305 is a specific instance. Therefore, CWE-305 is a more precise classification. There are no direct parent-child or chain relationships provided in the **Complete CWE Specifications** for CWE-305.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe305[\"CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe305 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe305 primary\n    class cwe287 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **primary weakness** that leads to the **authentication bypass**, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to log in to the device.\n\nRoot Cause: **Primary Weakness** leading to **Authentication Bypass**\nImpact: Unauthenticated Remote Login\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the **authentication bypass** vulnerability in ASUS routers. The vulnerability description clearly states that unauthenticated remote attackers can log in to the device. This suggests that the root cause lies in how the authentication mechanism is implemented.\n\nThe retriever results highlighted several candidate CWEs, including CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials), CWE-425 (Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')), CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function), and CWE-305 (Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness). After careful consideration, CWE-305 (Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness) was selected as the primary CWE because it most accurately captures the essence of the vulnerability, which is that the **authentication mechanism is bypassed due to a primary weakness**. The phrase \"**authentication bypass** vulnerability, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to log in the device\" is evidence that the **authentication** is bypassed.\n\nCWE-287 (Improper Authentication) was considered as a secondary CWE because it represents a broader category of authentication-related weaknesses. However, since the vulnerability description specifically mentions an **authentication bypass**, CWE-305 is a more precise and appropriate classification.\n\nThe decision to prioritize CWE-305 was also influenced by the provided guidance on Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control. The guidance emphasizes that CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is used when no identity validation is enforced, while CWE-305 is more appropriate when the **authentication algorithm is bypassed due to a primary weakness**.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication algorithm is sound, but the implemented mechanism can be bypassed as the result of a separate weakness that is primary to the authentication error.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-302: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe authentication scheme or implementation uses key data elements that are assumed to be immutable, but can be controlled or modified by the attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
