# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2024-10773

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-798 | Use of Hard-coded Credentials | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-912 | Hidden Functionality | 0.8 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the selection is the parent-child relationship between CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials) and its variants, such as CWE-259 (Use of Hard-coded Password) and CWE-321 (Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key). While the description mentions hardcoded credentials, it doesn't specify whether they are passwords or cryptographic keys, making the base CWE-798 the most appropriate choice. CWE-912 (Hidden Functionality) is a Class-level CWE that describes the presence of undocumented functionality. The report suggests that the vulnerability involves **hardcoded credentials** for hidden user levels, so CWE-912 applies.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **use of hardcoded credentials** (CWE-798) for hidden user levels (CWE-912). This allows for a **pass-the-hash attack**, leading to an attacker gaining full access to the device.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is based on the provided evidence, which clearly states the existence of **hardcoded credentials** for hidden user levels. The selection of CWE-798 is further supported by its high relevance score in the Retriever Results. The description does not specify the type of hardcoded credential (password or key), so the more general CWE-798 is chosen. CWE-912 is included as the **hardcoded credentials** belong to **hidden functionality**, which also led to the vulnerability.
The final selection balances specificity and accuracy, ensuring that the chosen CWEs accurately represent the vulnerability based on the available evidence.

**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.80
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate



## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.78
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product requires authentication, but the product has an alternate path or channel that does not require authentication.
