CWE-787 is a peer of CWE-121 and can often be a result of a buffer overflow. Given the description explicitly states \"stack-based buffer overflow\", CWE-121 is the more accurate and specific choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe121[\"CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe121 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe787 -->|PEEROF| cwe121\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe121 primary\n    class cwe119 secondary\n    class cwe787 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a crafted HTTP request leading to a **stack-based buffer overflow [CWE-121]**. The overflow allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code or commands.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary. The description explicitly states \"**stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability [CWE-121]**\". The retriever results also list CWE-121 as a possible candidate. The graph relationships confirm that CWE-121 is a variant of CWE-119, making it a more specific choice.
