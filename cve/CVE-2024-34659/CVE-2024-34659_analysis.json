CWE-200 is a class-level CWE representing the **impact** of sensitive information exposure, which can result from various root causes. The relationship between CWE-787 and CWE-200 is not directly defined in terms of parent-child or precedence, but the exploitation of an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) can lead to exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer\"]\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe787 -->|CAN_LEAD_TO| cwe200\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe200 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **stack-based out-of-bounds write** (**CWE-787**), which is the root cause. This leads to the exposure of sensitive information (**CWE-200**) and allows remote attackers to force victims to join the group.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary vulnerability is the stack-based out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) because it's the root cause explicitly mentioned in the CVE description. The evidence is: \"Root cause of vulnerability: Stack-based out-of-bounds write.\" and \"Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stack-based out-of-bounds write\". The retriever results, while listing CWE-200, indicate it's a common impact but not the root cause. CWE-787 is a base-level CWE, providing a more specific description of the vulnerability compared to its parent class CWE-119. Other CWEs were considered but not used because they didn't directly address the root cause or were too high-level. The exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200) is a consequence of the out-of-bounds write and is considered a secondary effect.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent sensitive system-level information from being accessed by unauthorized actors who do not have the same level of access to the underlying system as the product does.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-200 is commonly misused to represent the loss of confidentiality in a vulnerability, but confidentiality loss is a technical impact - not a root cause error.
