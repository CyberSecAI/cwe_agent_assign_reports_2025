# Analysis for CVE-2025-30122

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-1392 | Use of Default Credentials | 1.0 | Base | Primary | Allowed |
| CWE-288 | Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel | 0.7 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship influencing the decision is the hierarchical one. CWE-1392 (Use of Default Credentials) is a base CWE, representing a specific type of vulnerability that arises from using default credentials. CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) is considered because the **default credentials** effectively create an alternate, insecure channel.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a uniform default credential set that cannot be modified**, leading to unauthorized access.
  - Root Cause: CWE-1392 Use of Default Credentials
  - Impact: Unauthorized access due to the default credentials allowing an attacker to bypass normal authentication. This could be classified as CWE-288 Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel.

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified CWE-1392 as the primary weakness due to the **uniform default credential set that cannot be modified**. This is supported by the "Vulnerability Description Key Phrases" and the "CVE Reference Links Content Summary". The Retriever Results also highlighted CWE-1392.

The evidence strongly supports this classification. The vulnerability description states the device has "a **uniform default credential set that cannot be modified**," which directly aligns with the definition of CWE-1392: "The product uses default credentials (such as passwords or cryptographic keys) for potentially critical functionality."

The inclusion of CWE-288 as a secondary weakness acknowledges that the default credentials effectively bypass the intended authentication mechanism.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-1392 being a Base CWE and CWE-288 also being a Base CWE.
