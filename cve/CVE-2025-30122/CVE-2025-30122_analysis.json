It provides details beyond the placeholder description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe ROADCAM X3 dashcam ships with identical default credentials for all devices.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Use of default credentials.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nAttackers can use the same credentials to connect to any ROADCAM X3 dashcam with default settings within range, enabling unauthorized access to multiple devices.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   Direct access to the dashcam network interface.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be within range of the dashcam's network.\n*   No specialized skills are explicitly mentioned, implying a low barrier to entry.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe content does not explicitly state a fix, but implies changing the default credentials is necessary.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\n\nThe content specifically identifies the affected product as ROADCAM X3. It also mentions a second vulnerability (CVE-2025-30123) related to hardcoded FTP credentials in the mobile app.",

CWE-1392 (Use of Default Credentials) is a base CWE, representing a specific type of vulnerability that arises from using default credentials. CWE-288 (Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel) is considered because the **default credentials** effectively create an alternate, insecure channel.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe1392[\"CWE-1392: Use of Default Credentials\"]\n    cwe288[\"CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel\"]\n\n    cwe288 -->|PEEROF| cwe1392\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe1392 primary\n    class cwe288 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **use of a uniform default credential set that cannot be modified**, leading to unauthorized access.\n  - Root Cause: CWE-1392 Use of Default Credentials\n  - Impact: Unauthorized access due to the default credentials allowing an attacker to bypass normal authentication. This could be classified as CWE-288 Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-1392 as the primary weakness due to the **uniform default credential set that cannot be modified**. This is supported by the \"Vulnerability Description Key Phrases\" and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\". The Retriever Results also highlighted CWE-1392.\n\nThe evidence strongly supports this classification. The vulnerability description states the device has \"a **uniform default credential set that cannot be modified**,\" which directly aligns with the definition of CWE-1392: \"The product uses default credentials (such as passwords or cryptographic keys) for potentially critical functionality.\"\n\nThe inclusion of CWE-288 as a secondary weakness acknowledges that the default credentials effectively bypass the intended authentication mechanism.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity, with CWE-1392 being a Base CWE and CWE-288 also being a Base CWE.\n\nRelevant
