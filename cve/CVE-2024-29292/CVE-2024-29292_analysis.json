CWE-78 is a more specific case of CWE-77, focusing specifically on OS commands. The evidence clearly points to OS command injection.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper neutralization** of special elements within the input. This leads to the execution of arbitrary OS commands.\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (CWE-78)\n2.  **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary OS commands.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified CWE-78 as the primary weakness due to the vulnerability description explicitly stating \"OS Command Injection\". The CVE Reference Links Content Summary further supports this by mentioning \"Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command, leading to command injection\" and \"OS Command Injection (CWE-77)\". While CWE-77 is also applicable as a more general case, CWE-78 is more specific and therefore a better fit.\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-78 is a child of CWE-77, making it a more specific classification.\n\nThe final selection is based on the evidence of OS command execution.
