## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
**Relevant Content:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** A large number of container checkpoint requests made to the unauthenticated kubelet read-only HTTP endpoint may cause a Node Denial of Service by filling the Node's disk.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Node Denial of Service.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Node Denial of Service by filling the Node's disk.
*   **Attack vectors:** A large number of requests to the kubelet read-only HTTP server's `/checkpoint` endpoint.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The kubelet read-only HTTP port must be enabled.
*   **Affected versions:**
    *   kubelet v1.32.0 to v1.32.1
    *   kubelet v1.31.0 to v1.31.5

*   **Mitigation or fix:**
    *   Mitigation:
        *   Setting the `ContainerCheckpoint` feature gate to `false` in your kubelet configuration.
        *   Disabling the kubelet read-only port.
        *   Limiting access to the kubelet API.
    *   Fixed Versions:
        *   kubelet v1.32.2
        *   kubelet v1.31.6
