  "description": "The SIP Reviews Shortcode for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the no_of_reviews attribute in the woocommerce_reviews shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.3 due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6480\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `woocommerce_reviews` shortcode. Specifically, the `no_of_reviews` attribute is vulnerable.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape the `no_of_reviews` attribute, allowing the injection of arbitrary web scripts.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page, which will then execute in the browsers of users who visit the compromised page. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities.\n- **Privilege Escalation:** While not directly stated, successful XSS can lead to privilege escalation by hijacking admin sessions, potentially taking full control of the site.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n- **Shortcode Injection:** An attacker injects a crafted `woocommerce_reviews` shortcode containing malicious JavaScript within the vulnerable `no_of_reviews` attribute on a WordPress page or post.\n- **User Interaction:** When a user visits the page containing the malicious shortcode, the injected JavaScript executes within their browser.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site, enabling them to create or edit posts and pages.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The vulnerability exists in all versions of the \"SIP Reviews Shortcode for WooCommerce\" plugin up to and including 1.2.3.\n- The vulnerable code is located in the `plugin-reviews-shortcode-display.php` file.\n- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on October 31, 2024.\n- No patch is available currently. The recommendation is to uninstall the plugin.\n\n**Specific Code Location (From Trac):**\nThe Wordfence article references line 424 in `plugin-reviews-shortcode-display.php` as relevant. This corresponds to the line where the shortcode's output is generated and could be the location where the unsanitized `no_of_reviews` attribute is being used.\n```php\nif ( $out_reviews != '' ) {\n  $out_reviews = '<ul id=\"'.$no_of_reviews.'\" class=\"commentbox commentlist commentlist-'. $id .' commentlist_'. $id .'\">' . $out_reviews . '</ul><button '. $button .' class=\"sip-rswc-more\" id=\"sip-rswc-more-'. $id .'\" type=\"button\">'.__( 'Load More', 'sip-reviews-shortcode' ).'</button>';\n}\n```\nThis confirms that the `no_of_reviews` attribute is directly used to set the ID of a `<ul>` HTML element, thus making it vulnerable to XSS if not properly sanitized.",

An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code via the `no_of_reviews` attribute. When a user visits the page, the script executes, potentially leading to privilege escalation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis indicates a Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability due to **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** in the SIP Reviews Shortcode for WooCommerce plugin. The primary CWE is **CWE-79**, as it directly addresses the improper neutralization of input during web page generation. The high retriever score for **CWE-79** and the explicit mention of **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** support this choice. The code snippet confirms that the `no_of_reviews` attribute is used without proper sanitization, leading to the vulnerability.\n\nI considered **CWE-116 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output)** as a secondary CWE as it represents a broader category of output-related vulnerabilities. **CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'))** was not selected because there is no indication of SQL injection in the provided vulnerability description.
