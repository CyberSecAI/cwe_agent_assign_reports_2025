This is due to the **missing or incorrect nonce validation**, which is a form of **insufficient verification of the request origin**. CWE-472 represents the **external control of assumed-immutable web parameter** which relates to the forged request. CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) is a higher-level class that could be related because the **missing nonce validation** effectively bypasses authorization checks.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe472[\"CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe472 -->|CHILDOF| cwe352\n    cwe862 -->|RELATED_TO| cwe352\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe472,cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain starts with the **missing or incorrect nonce validation**. This leads to the possibility of a forged request being successful (CWE-472 External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter), ultimately resulting in a **Cross-Site Request Forgery** (CWE-352), where an unauthenticated attacker can update settings and inject malicious scripts.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is primarily based on the vulnerability description, which clearly states the presence of a **Cross-Site Request Forgery** vulnerability due to **missing or incorrect nonce validation**.\n\n*   \"The Add Google +1 (Plus one) social share Button plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to **Cross-Site Request Forgery** in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to **missing or incorrect nonce validation**\"\n\nThis provides strong evidence for CWE-352. While CWE-472 and CWE-862 were considered, they are more secondary aspects of the vulnerability. CWE-472 represents the external manipulation and CWE-862 the bypassed authorization.
