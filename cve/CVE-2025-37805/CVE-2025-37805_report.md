# Vulnerability Analysis Report: CVE-2025-37805

## Description

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved sound/virtio Fix cancel_sync warnings on **uninitialized work_struct**s Betty reported hitting the following warning [ 8.709131][ T221] WARNING CPU 2 PID 221 at kernel/workqueue.c4182 ... [ 8.713282][ T221] Call trace [ 8.713365][ T221] __flush_work+0x8d0/0x914 [ 8.713468][ T221] __cancel_work_sync+0xac/0xfc [ 8.713570][ T221] cancel_work_sync+0x24/0x34 [ 8.713667][ T221] virtsnd_remove+0xa8/0xf8 [virtio_snd ab15f34d0dd772f6d11327e08a81d46dc9c36276] [ 8.713868][ T221] virtsnd_probe+0x48c/0x664 [virtio_snd ab15f34d0dd772f6d11327e08a81d46dc9c36276] [ 8.714035][ T221] virtio_dev_probe+0x28c/0x390 [ 8.714139][ T221] really_probe+0x1bc/0x4c8 ... It seems were hitting the error path in virtsnd_probe(), which triggers a virtsnd_remove() which iterates over the substreams calling cancel_work_sync() on the elapsed_period work_struct. Looking at the code, from earlier in virtsnd_probe()->virtsnd_build_devs()->virtsnd_pcm_parse_cfg() We set snd->nsubstreams, allocate the snd->substreams, and if we then hit an error on the info allocation or something in virtsnd_ctl_query_info() fails, we will exit without having initialized the elapsed_period work_struct. When that error path unwinds we then call virtsnd_remove() which as long as the substreams array is allocated, will iterate through calling cancel_work_sync() on the uninitialized work struct hitting this warning. Takashi Iwai suggested this fix, which initializes the substreams structure right after allocation, so that if we hit the error paths we avoid trying to cleanup **uninitialized data**. Note I have not yet managed to reproduce the issue myself, so this patch has had limited testing. Feedback or thoughts would be appreciated!

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship that influenced the CWE selection is the hierarchical relationship between CWE-665 (Improper Initialization), CWE-909 (Missing Initialization of Resource), CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource), and CWE-824 (Access of Uninitialized Pointer). CWE-909 is a child of CWE-665, and CWE-908 and CWE-824 are related to missing initializations, representing more specific cases. The abstraction level also plays a role, with preference given to Base or Variant levels where appropriate.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing initialization** of the `elapsed_period work_struct`. This leads to the attempt to `cancel_work_sync()` on the **uninitialized data**, which then results in a warning.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis identified that the root cause of the vulnerability is the **missing initialization** of the `elapsed_period work_struct`. When an error occurs during the initialization process in `virtsnd_probe()`, the code proceeds to `virtsnd_remove()` without properly initializing the `work_struct`. This leads to `cancel_work_sync()` being called on **uninitialized data**, causing a warning. The evidence is "Looking at the code, from earlier in virtsnd_probe()->virtsnd_build_devs()->virtsnd_pcm_parse_cfg() We set snd->nsubstreams, allocate the snd->substreams, and if we then hit an error on the info allocation or something in virtsnd_ctl_query_info() fails, we will exit without having initialized the elapsed_period work_struct."

CWE-909 (Missing Initialization of Resource) is chosen as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the root cause. While CWE-665 (Improper Initialization) is a broader category, CWE-909 is more specific and accurately describes the missing initialization of a resource. The retriever results also list CWE-909 as the top candidate.

CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource) and CWE-824 (Access of Uninitialized Pointer) are considered as secondary CWEs because the description also includes an attempt to use the uninitialized data (CWE-908) and the possibility of accessing an uninitialized pointer within the work struct (CWE-824).

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-909 captures the overall **missing initialization** problem, while CWE-908 and CWE-824 highlight potential consequences of using the **uninitialized resource**.
