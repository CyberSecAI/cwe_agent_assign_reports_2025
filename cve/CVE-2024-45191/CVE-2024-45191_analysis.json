  "description": "An issue was discovered in Matrix libolm through 3.2.16. The AES implementation is vulnerable to **cache-timing attacks** due to use of S-boxes. This is related to software that uses a lookup table for the SubWord step. This refers to the libolm implementation of Olm. NOTE This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45191:\n\n**Verification:**\n\nThe provided content directly references CVE-2024-45191 and provides detailed information about the vulnerability. The vulnerability is present in the AES implementation of the Olm library.\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is the use of a software-based implementation of AES that relies on a look-up table (S-box) for the `SubWord` step. This design makes the implementation vulnerable to cache-timing attacks.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Cache-timing vulnerability:** The software AES implementation uses a look-up table ( `aes_sbox`) indexed by secret data which leads to cache hits and misses that reveal information about the key.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Secret Key Extraction:** An attacker can potentially extract the secret key by observing the timing differences of the vulnerable AES implementation during encryption.\n*  The blog mentions that similar attacks have been previously used to extract secret keys from other software, including OpenSSL and dm-crypt.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Local:** An attacker can observe cache timing differences locally, by running malicious processes on the same hardware as the vulnerable software\n*   **Remote:** With enough samples, timing differences are observable over the network through normal operation of the vulnerable software.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Local Access (for more precise attacks):** Ability to run code on the same machine as the vulnerable application to more accurately measure cache timings.\n*   **Network Access (for remote attacks):** Ability to observe network traffic and collect many samples to detect timing differences over the network.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   The blog post provides specific code snippets of the vulnerable AES implementation.\n*   It also references research papers which discuss cache-timing attacks and their feasibility.\n*   It mentions the recommended mitigation which involves using hardware-accelerated AES, or bitsliced AES implementations (like the one in BearSSL).\n*   The Matrix developers were aware of the vulnerability but knowingly shipped the vulnerable code for years without fixing it due to the deprecation of libolm.",

The key phrase \"cache-timing attacks\" directly points to timing-related weaknesses. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary confirms that the root cause is the use of S-boxes, which leads to cache hits and misses that reveal information about the key. This aligns perfectly with CWE-208 (Observable Timing Discrepancy).\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision to consider CWE-327 and CWE-385 as secondary candidates.
