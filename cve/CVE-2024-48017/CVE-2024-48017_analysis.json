Since the vulnerability specifically mentions OS commands, the more specific CWE-78 is chosen.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n\n    cwe78 -- CHILDOF --> cwe77\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe chain of events is as follows:\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command** (specifically for OS commands) - CWE-78\n2.  **Impact:** Code execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command (Command Injection)**, which is the root cause of the vulnerability. The CVE Reference Links Content Summary also states: \"Root cause of vulnerability: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\". The term \"OS command\" appears in the CWE-78 description, which is more specific than the general command injection (CWE-77). Therefore, CWE-78 is the primary CWE. The retriever results also list CWE-78 as a candidate.
