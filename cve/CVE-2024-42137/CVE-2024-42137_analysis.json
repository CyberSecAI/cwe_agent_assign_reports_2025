  "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved Bluetooth qca Fix BT enable failure again for QCA6390 after warm reboot Commit 272970be3dab (Bluetooth hci_qca Fix driver shutdown on closed serdev) will cause below regression issue BT cant be enabled after below steps cold boot -> enable BT -> disable BT -> warm reboot -> BT enable failure if property enable-gpios is not configured within DT|ACPI for QCA6390. The commit is to fix a use-after-free issue within qca_serdev_shutdown() by adding condition to avoid the serdev is flushed or wrote after closed but also introduces this regression issue regarding above steps since the VSC is not sent to reset controller during warm reboot. Fixed by sending the VSC to reset controller within qca_serdev_shutdown() once BT was ever enabled, and the use-after-free issue is also fixed by this change since the serdev is still opened before it is flushed or wrote. Verified by the reported machine Dell XPS 13 9310 laptop over below two kernel commits commit e00fc2700a3f (Bluetooth btusb Fix triggering coredump implementation for QCA) of bluetooth-next tree. commit b23d98d46d28 (Bluetooth btusb Fix triggering coredump implementation for QCA) of linus mainline tree.",

  "reference_content": "The provided content relates to CVE-2024-42137.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability arises from a regression introduced by commit 272970be3dab, which aimed to fix a use-after-free issue in `qca_serdev_shutdown()`. This fix added a condition to prevent flushing or writing to the serdev after it was closed. However, it inadvertently stopped the VSC (Vendor Specific Command) from being sent during a warm reboot, which is necessary to reset the controller. As a result, the Bluetooth device fails to enable after a warm reboot if the `enable-gpios` property is not configured in the device tree or ACPI for the QCA6390 chipset.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- **Regression:** A previous fix for a use-after-free issue caused a new regression where the Bluetooth device could not be enabled after a warm reboot in certain configurations.\n- **Missing VSC during warm reboot:** The VSC, needed to reset the Bluetooth controller, was not sent in the `qca_serdev_shutdown()` function during a warm reboot.\n- **Use-after-free (indirect):** Although the primary fix aimed to address a use-after-free, the regression reintroduced a scenario where the serdev might be accessed in an incorrect state, if not handled correctly.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- **Bluetooth Enable Failure:** The primary impact is that the Bluetooth device on systems using the QCA6390 chipset will fail to enable after a warm reboot if the `enable-gpios` property is not configured in the device tree or ACPI. This means that the user won't be able to use their Bluetooth device, which will render it useless.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The vulnerability is triggered by a specific sequence of actions: cold boot, enabling Bluetooth, disabling Bluetooth, warm reboot, and then attempting to enable Bluetooth.\n- The vulnerability manifests in systems using the QCA6390 chipset with specific device tree or ACPI configurations lacking the `enable-gpios` property.\n- The vulnerability can be triggered by a simple reboot and toggling the bluetooth on and off, making it easily reproducible.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to trigger a warm reboot of the system.\n- The attacker needs to have a system with a QCA6390 Bluetooth chipset where the `enable-gpios` property isn't configured in the device tree or ACPI.\n- No specific privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability. A normal user could trigger this if they have access to a machine with the specified conditions.",

The **rootcause** is that the VSC reset was **missing** during warm reboot because the previous fix introduced a regression. The system detects the error condition but takes no action to correct it, leading to Bluetooth failure. |\n| CWE-755 | Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. The product detects an exceptional condition (failure to initialize bluetooth) but does not handle it correctly. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship influencing the choice of CWE-390 is its direct link to CWE-755, where CWE-390 is a base CWE of the class CWE-755. The relationship highlights the progression of the vulnerability, with the detection of an error condition (CWE-390) stemming from the improper handling of exceptional conditions (CWE-755). The decision favors CWE-390 due to its base level specificity, aligning with the concrete error condition of a **missing** VSC reset.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe390[\"CWE-390: Detection of Error Condition Without Action\"]\n    cwe755[\"CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\"]\n\n    cwe390 -->|CHILDOF| cwe755\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe390 primary\n    class cwe755 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **missing** VSC reset during warm reboot (CWE-390), which leads to the Bluetooth enable failure. The error condition is detected, but no corrective action is taken.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis identifies CWE-390 as the primary weakness due to the **missing** VSC reset during warm reboot and resulting Bluetooth enable failure. This is supported by the vulnerability description that highlights the **rootcause** as a **missing** VSC reset, leading to a detectable error condition.\n\nThe decision is based on the provided evidence, specifically the vulnerability description and CVE reference link content summary. The graph relationships influenced the decision by clarifying the connection between different CWEs and helping to select the most specific CWE.
