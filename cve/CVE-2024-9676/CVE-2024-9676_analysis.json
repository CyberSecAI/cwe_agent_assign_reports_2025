  "description": "A vulnerability was found in Podman, Buildah, and CRI-O. A **symlink traversal vulnerability** in the containers/storage library can cause Podman, Buildah, and CRI-O to hang and result in a denial of service via OOM kill when running a malicious image using an automatically assigned user namespace (`--userns=auto` in Podman and Buildah). The containers/storage library will read /etc/passwd inside the container, but does not properly validate if that file is a symlink, which can be used to cause the library to read an arbitrary file on the host.",

  "reference_content": "Here's the information extracted from the provided content regarding CVE-2024-9676:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability is caused by a symlink traversal issue within the `containers/storage` library. This library is used by Podman, Buildah, and CRI-O to handle container storage. The library reads `/etc/passwd` inside the container but does not validate if it is a symlink, which allows it to read an arbitrary file on the host.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Symlink traversal vulnerability.\n- Improper input validation.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Denial of service (DoS) by causing the affected processes to hang, potentially leading to an out-of-memory (OOM) kill. This can be triggered when a malicious container image uses a symlink for /etc/passwd, pointing to a FIFO on the host, and an automatically assigned user namespace.\n- In some cases, a small risk of information disclosure might exist via error messages, though only potentially revealing file contents that the user already has access to.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Exploitation can occur when running a malicious container image that contains a crafted symlink.\n- Requires an automatically assigned user namespace (`--userns=auto`).\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- Attacker must be able to create and run a malicious container image.\n- Needs to control container content.\n- The attacker must use a user namespace which is assigned automatically.\n\n**Additional Details**\n- The vulnerability affects Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and other container tools built with the vulnerable containers/storage library.\n- The issue was resolved in multiple advisories by updating the affected packages.\n- The vulnerability's severity is rated as \"Important\" in some advisories and \"Moderate\" in others, depending on context and affected product.\n- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, with low attack complexity.",

CWE-61 is a compound CWE that includes symlink-related vulnerabilities, and while relevant, CWE-59 is more specific to the **root cause**.
