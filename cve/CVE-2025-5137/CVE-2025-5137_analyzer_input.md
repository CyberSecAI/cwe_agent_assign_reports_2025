## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
Root cause of vulnerability:
- Insufficient filtering of the `$filename` variable in `dede/sys_verifies.php` in DedeCMS V5.7.117, allowing for the writing of malicious code.
- The developer added a layer of filtering to the `$filename` variable, but the filtering was not coordinated with the existing filtering in `common.inc.php` and the lack of filtering of double quotes and semicolons.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- User-controllable file writing.
- Background arbitrary code execution (RCE).

Impact of exploitation:
- Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

Attack vectors:
- Exploiting the `dede/sys_verifies.php` file with a crafted URL.
- Requires administrator credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Administrator credentials for the DedeCMS backend.

Mitigation or fix:
- Strengthen the filtering of the `refiles` parameters, such as filtering spaces, dots, dollar signs, etc.
