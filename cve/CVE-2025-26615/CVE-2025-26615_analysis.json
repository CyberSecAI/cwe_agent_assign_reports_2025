  "description": "WeGIA is an open source Web Manager for Institutions with a focus on Portuguese language users. A **Path Traversal vulnerability** was discovered in the WeGIA application, `examples.php` endpoint. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in `config.php`. `config.php` contains information that could allow direct access to the database. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.14 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

It provides significantly more detail than the placeholder CVE description.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nImproper validation of the `src` parameter in the `examples.php` endpoint.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   Path Traversal (CWE-22, CWE-284)\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:**  An attacker can read `config.php`, potentially exposing database login credentials.\n*   **Database Takeover:** Compromised database credentials could lead to full database control.\n*   **System Information Disclosure:** Access to files like `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/os-release`, and `win.ini` is possible.\n*   **Potential for SSH Access:** If a private key (e.g., `/root/.ssh/id_rsa`) is accessible, an attacker might gain SSH access with root privileges.\n*   **Chain Attacks:** Information gathered can be used to exploit other vulnerabilities.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.\n*   **POST Request:** Exploitation occurs via a POST request to `/assets/vendor/jquery-datatables/examples/resources/examples.php` with a malicious `src` parameter.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   No privileges required.\n*   No user interaction required.\n*   Network access to the vulnerable endpoint.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is patched in version 3.2.14.\n*   The underlying issue in `jquery-datatables` is resolved in newer versions of that library through proper regular expression validation.\n\n**PoC (Proof of Concept):**\n\n```\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8080/assets/vendor/jquery-datatables/examples/resources/examples.php --data \"src=scripts/a.php/../../../../../../../../../../../var/www/html/config.php\"\n```\n\n**CVSS Score:**\n\n*   Overall Score: 10.0 (Critical)\n*   CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H\n\n**Affected versions:**\n\n<= 3.2.13\n\n**Patched versions:**\n\n3.2.14",

The vulnerability is caused by **improper limitation of a pathname** to a restricted directory. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 1.0\n*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-22, which is a base level CWE. There are child CWEs like CWE-23 (Relative Path Traversal) and CWE-24 (Path Traversal: '../filedir').

The root cause is the **improper validation** of the `src` parameter, allowing an attacker to access sensitive information stored in `config.php`. This aligns directly with CWE-22, \"Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')\".\n\nThe evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary clearly points to a path traversal issue: \"Improper validation of the `src` parameter in the `examples.php` endpoint.\" and \"Path Traversal (CWE-22, CWE-284)\". The impact of the vulnerability is also well-defined: \"Sensitive Information Disclosure: An attacker can read `config.php`, potentially exposing database login credentials.\".\n\nCWE-22 is the most specific and appropriate CWE based on the provided information. The retriever results also list CWE-22 as the top result with a high score.\n\nCWE-23 (Relative Path Traversal) was considered, but the description doesn't specifically focus on relative path traversal, so the parent, CWE-22, is more appropriate.",
