## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-26615 Content

This content **relates** to CVE-2025-26615. It provides significantly more detail than the placeholder CVE description.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

Improper validation of the `src` parameter in the `examples.php` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Path Traversal (CWE-22, CWE-284)

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:**  An attacker can read `config.php`, potentially exposing database login credentials.
*   **Database Takeover:** Compromised database credentials could lead to full database control.
*   **System Information Disclosure:** Access to files like `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/os-release`, and `win.ini` is possible.
*   **Potential for SSH Access:** If a private key (e.g., `/root/.ssh/id_rsa`) is accessible, an attacker might gain SSH access with root privileges.
*   **Chain Attacks:** Information gathered can be used to exploit other vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **POST Request:** Exploitation occurs via a POST request to `/assets/vendor/jquery-datatables/examples/resources/examples.php` with a malicious `src` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   No privileges required.
*   No user interaction required.
*   Network access to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Mitigation or fix:**

*   The vulnerability is patched in version 3.2.14.
*   The underlying issue in `jquery-datatables` is resolved in newer versions of that library through proper regular expression validation.

**PoC (Proof of Concept):**

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/assets/vendor/jquery-datatables/examples/resources/examples.php --data "src=scripts/a.php/../../../../../../../../../../../var/www/html/config.php"
```

**CVSS Score:**

*   Overall Score: 10.0 (Critical)
*   CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Affected versions:**

<= 3.2.13

**Patched versions:**
