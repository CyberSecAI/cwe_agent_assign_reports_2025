The function does not properly sanitize the `app_name` parameter, enabling an attacker to upload a malicious `server.py` file and execute arbitrary code by exploiting the **path traversal vulnerability**.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'does not properly sanitize the app_name parameter', 'weakness': ['path traversal vulnerability', 'OS command injection'], 'impact': 'upload a malicious server.py file and execute arbitrary code', 'vector': '', 'attacker': 'attacker', 'product': 'parisneo/lollms-webui', 'version': 'V12 (Strawberry)', 'component': 'start_app_server function'}, reference_content='The provided content details a **Path Traversal combined with OS Command Injection** vulnerability in `parisneo/lollms-webui`.\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\n\\nThe `start_app_server` function does not sanitize input data, specifically the `app_name` parameter, allowing for path traversal. This, in conjunction with the `run_server` function which uses `subprocess.Popen` to execute `server.py` scripts based on the potentially manipulated `app_path`, leads to OS command injection.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n\\n* Path Traversal\\n* OS Command Injection\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n\\nAllows attackers to execute arbitrary malicious code on the server.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n\\n* Uploading a malicious `server.py` file to a known location (e.g., `discussion_databases/{name_database}/{id}/text_data`).\\n* Sending a POST request to `/apps/start_server` with the `app_name` parameter set to a path traversal payload pointing to the uploaded malicious file (e.g., `\"../discussion_databases/default/2/text_data\"`).\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n\\n* Ability to upload files to the server.\\n* Ability to send authenticated POST requests to `/apps/start_server`.\\n\\n**Mitigation or fix:**\\n\\nThe content suggests a fix by adding `app_path =sanitize_path(app_path )` in the `start_app_server` function. This indicates that sanitizing the `app_path` is the intended mitigation.\\n\\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\\n\\n* **Proof of Concept:** A detailed proof of concept is provided, including steps to prepare and upload a malicious `server.py` file, identify its location, and trigger its execution via a crafted HTTP request. An example HTTP request and response are also included.\\n* **Video PoC:** A link to a video demonstration of the vulnerability is provided.\\n* **Affected Code Location:** The vulnerability is specifically identified in `lollms_apps.py` at line 535, within the `start_app_server` asynchronous function.\\n* **Timeline:** Reported on September 6th, 2024.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {},
