This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of Paessler PRTG Network Monitor. Some user interaction on the part of an administrator is required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the PRTG Network Monitor web interface. The issue results from the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data**, which can lead to the injection of an arbitrary script. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass authentication on the system. Was ZDI-CAN-23371.",

CWE-79 is a base CWE that is related to improper neutralization of input. CWE-306, on the other hand, falls under the category of authentication and access control, specifically dealing with the absence of authentication mechanisms for critical functionalities. There is no direct parent-child relationship between the two.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe79 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe79 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** in the PRTG Network Monitor web interface. This leads to the injection of an arbitrary script (CWE-79), which results in an authentication bypass (CWE-306), allowing network-adjacent attackers to gain unauthorized access.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis identified two potential CWEs: CWE-79 for the **Cross-Site Scripting** (**injection**) due to **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** and CWE-306 for the authentication bypass.\n\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions the **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** leading to **Cross-Site Scripting, injection**. This aligns perfectly with CWE-79, which deals with the improper neutralization of input during web page generation. The description also states that this vulnerability leads to an authentication bypass.\n\nThe retriever results also list CWE-79.\n\nThe evidence from the vulnerability description, especially the phrases related to **lack of proper validation of user-supplied data** and the resulting **Cross-Site Scripting, injection**, strongly supports the selection of CWE-79 as the primary root cause. The authentication bypass is a consequence of the XSS, making CWE-306 a secondary concern.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as

        "extended_description": "\n\nThis weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.\n\n\nThere are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:\n\n\n  - The application intends to execute a single, fixed program that is under its own control. It intends to use externally-supplied inputs as arguments to that program. For example, the program might use system(\"nslookup [HOSTNAME]\") to run nslookup and allow the user to supply a HOSTNAME, which is used as an argument. Attackers cannot prevent nslookup from executing. However, if the program does not remove command separators from the HOSTNAME argument, attackers could place the separators into the arguments, which allows them to execute their own program after nslookup has finished executing.\n\n  - The application accepts an input that it uses to fully select which program to run, as well as which commands to use. The application simply redirects this entire command to the operating system. For example, the program might use \"exec([COMMAND])\" to execute the [COMMAND] that was supplied by the user. If the COMMAND is under attacker control, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands or programs. If the command is being executed using functions like exec() and CreateProcess(), the attacker might not be able to combine multiple commands together in the same line.\n\nFrom a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.",
