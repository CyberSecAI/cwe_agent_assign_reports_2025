No child CWEs are clearly applicable based on the provided information. The retriever results suggest several related CWEs, but none are specific enough to warrant a different primary mapping. The main relationship influencing the decision is the lack of detailed information preventing a more specific mapping.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    class cwe200 primary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain is simple: a lack of proper access control or input validation leads to the **exposure of sensitive information**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **information disclosure** as the primary weakness. The retriever results and the vulnerability description both point to CWE-200 as the most relevant CWE.\n\nThe provided evidence is minimal, consisting only of a brief description stating that the vulnerability allows attackers to access sensitive details of the root user's session via an arbitrary command. Without more detail about the root cause (e.g., specific input validation failures, authentication bypass, etc.), a more precise CWE mapping is not possible.\n\nCWE-200 is a class-level CWE and is generally discouraged as a primary mapping. However, in this case, it serves as the best available option given the limited information. More specific CWEs like CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere) or CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File) could be applicable if more details about the vulnerability were known, but there is insufficient evidence to support those mappings.",
