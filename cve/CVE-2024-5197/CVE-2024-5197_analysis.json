  "description": "There exists interger overflows in libvpx in versions prior to 1.14.1. Calling vpx_img_alloc() with a large value of the d_w, d_h, or align parameter may result in **integer overflows** in the calculations of buffer sizes and offsets and some fields of the returned vpx_image_t struct may be invalid. Calling vpx_img_wrap() with a large value of the d_w, d_h, or stride_align parameter may result in **integer overflows** in the calculations of buffer sizes and offsets and some fields of the returned vpx_image_t struct may be invalid. We recommend upgrading to version 1.14.1 or beyond",

This might be achieved through tricking users into opening a malicious video, or by targeting server applications that process video content from untrusted sources.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n- The provided text is a security advisory from Debian LTS, which confirms the existence of the vulnerability and the availability of a fix.\n- The advisory states that the vulnerability is present in `libvpx` version prior to `1.7.0-3+deb10u3` on Debian 10 (buster).\n- It recommends upgrading the `libvpx` packages to address the issue.\n- It refers to the Debian security tracker for detailed security status.\n- This advisory provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description by describing the vulnerability type as integer overflow.",

This can lead to incorrect buffer size calculations (CWE-131), which can further result in out-of-bounds writes (CWE-787). The relationship between these CWEs is hierarchical and sequential. CWE-131 and CWE-787 are children of CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), indicating a memory management issue. CWE-190 can precede CWE-119. The abstraction levels are all base, providing a good level of detail.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe190[\"CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\"]\n    cwe131[\"CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe119[\"CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations\"]\n    \n    cwe131 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe787 -->|CHILDOF| cwe119\n    cwe190 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe131\n    cwe131 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe190 primary\n    class cwe131,cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe119 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with an **integer overflow** (CWE-190) when calculating buffer sizes or offsets. This leads to an **incorrect calculation of the buffer size** (CWE-131). Finally, this leads to an **out-of-bounds write** (CWE-787) when data is written to the buffer.\n\nCWE-190 (Root Cause) -> CWE-131 -> CWE-787 (Impact)\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**integer overflows**\" in `vpx_img_alloc()` and `vpx_img_wrap()` when called with large values. This directly corresponds to CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound). The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-190 as the primary weakness.\n\nThe integer overflow leads to incorrect calculations of buffer sizes and offsets, which aligns with CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size). The ultimate impact is an out-of-bounds write, which aligns with CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).\n\nThe graph relationships show that CWE-190 can precede CWE-131 and CWE-787. The chosen CWEs are at the base level, providing the most specific representation of the vulnerability.\n\nThe evidence provided supports the selection of CWE-190 as the primary weakness, with CWE-131 and CWE-787 as secondary weaknesses that result from the integer overflow.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
