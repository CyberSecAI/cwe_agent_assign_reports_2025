The vulnerability is a command injection in the Docker integration functionality. |\n| CWE-88 | Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection') | 0.7 | Base | Allowed | Secondary candidate.

The key phrase \"**command injection**\" strongly suggests CWE-78, which is further supported by the description of an attacker crafting a hyperlink to achieve command execution.\n\nThe graph relationships influenced the decision by highlighting the connection between CWE-78 and its parent CWE-77. This confirms that CWE-78 is a specific type of command injection related to OS commands.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because CWE-78 directly addresses the root cause of the vulnerability (i.e., **improper neutralization** leading to OS command injection), while CWE-88 could be a contributing factor by not delimiting the arguments properly.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs a string for a command to be executed by a separate component\nin another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the\nintended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
