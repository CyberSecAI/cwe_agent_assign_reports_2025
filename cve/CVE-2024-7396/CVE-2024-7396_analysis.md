# Analysis for CVE-2024-7396

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information | 1 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE |
| CWE-311 | Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data | 0.7 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary Candidate |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.9
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary CWE is CWE-319, which is a child of CWE-311. CWE-319 is more specific, indicating that the sensitive data is transmitted in cleartext, which aligns with the vulnerability description and CVE reference links. Choosing CWE-319 provides a more precise description of the vulnerability than its parent, CWE-311.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with the **missing encryption of sensitive data**, leading to the impact of eavesdropping because the communication is transmitted in plain text.
Root Cause: **Missing encryption of sensitive data** (CWE-311)
Weakness: Cleartext Transmission (CWE-319)
Impact: Eavesdropping

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis identified several candidate CWEs, including CWE-311, CWE-319, and CWE-321. The vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary indicate that the communication is transmitted in plain text.
The **root cause** is the **missing encryption of sensitive data**, and the **weakness** is that the communication of the configuration service is transmitted in plain text. The impact is that an attacker could sniff passwords or other critical information.
CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is the most appropriate CWE because it accurately describes the vulnerability. It is a Base level CWE, which is preferred. The usage is ALLOWED.
CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) is a Class level CWE, and the mapping guidance discourages its use because more specific children are available. While the vulnerability description mentions **missing encryption of sensitive data**, the CVE reference links content summary clarifies that the communication is transmitted in plain text, making CWE-319 a more accurate choice.

CWEs considered but not used:
- CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data. While the vulnerability description mentions **missing encryption of sensitive data**, it is a class-level CWE and less specific than CWE-319. The mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific children are available.
- CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key. This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is not related to the use of a hard-coded key, but rather to the **missing encryption**.
- CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information. This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is related to the transmission of sensitive information, not its storage.

# Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)

## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Discouraged
- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).

## CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product behaves differently or sends different responses under different circumstances in a way that is observable to an unauthorized actor, which exposes security-relevant information about the state of the product, such as whether a particular operation was successful or not.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The use of a hard-coded cryptographic key significantly increases the possibility that encrypted data may be recovered.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.69

**Description**:
The product stores or transmits sensitive data using an encryption scheme that is theoretically sound, but is not strong enough for the level of protection required.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature
