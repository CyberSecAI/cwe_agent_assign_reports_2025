CWE-319 is more specific, indicating that the sensitive data is transmitted in cleartext, which aligns with the vulnerability description and CVE reference links. Choosing CWE-319 provides a more precise description of the vulnerability than its parent, CWE-311.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe319[\"CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information\"]\n    cwe311[\"CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\"]\n\n    cwe319 -->|CHILDOF| cwe311\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe319 primary\n    class cwe311 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing encryption of sensitive data**, leading to the impact of eavesdropping because the communication is transmitted in plain text.\nRoot Cause: **Missing encryption of sensitive data** (CWE-311)\nWeakness: Cleartext Transmission (CWE-319)\nImpact: Eavesdropping\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial analysis identified several candidate CWEs, including CWE-311, CWE-319, and CWE-321. The vulnerability description and CVE reference links content summary indicate that the communication is transmitted in plain text.\nThe **root cause** is the **missing encryption of sensitive data**, and the **weakness** is that the communication of the configuration service is transmitted in plain text. The impact is that an attacker could sniff passwords or other critical information.\nCWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information) is the most appropriate CWE because it accurately describes the vulnerability. It is a Base level CWE, which is preferred. The usage is ALLOWED.\nCWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) is a Class level CWE, and the mapping guidance discourages its use because more specific children are available. While the vulnerability description mentions **missing encryption of sensitive data**, the CVE reference links content summary clarifies that the communication is transmitted in plain text, making CWE-319 a more accurate choice.\n\nCWEs considered but not used:\n- CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data. While the vulnerability description mentions **missing encryption of sensitive data**, it is a class-level CWE and less specific than CWE-319. The mapping guidance discourages its use when more specific children are available.\n- CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key. This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is not related to the use of a hard-coded key, but rather to the **missing encryption**.\n- CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information. This CWE is not applicable because the vulnerability is related to the transmission of sensitive information, not its storage.\n\n# Relevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-311 is high-level with more precise children available.
