  "description": "The CloudStack cluster service runs on unauthenticated port (default 9090) that can be misused to run arbitrary commands on targeted hypervisors and CloudStack management server hosts. Some of these commands were found to have **command injection** vulnerabilities that can result in arbitrary code execution via agents on the hosts that may run as a privileged user. An attacker that can reach the cluster service on the unauthenticated port (default 9090), can exploit this to perform remote code execution on CloudStack managed hosts and result in complete compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of CloudStack managed infrastructure. Users are recommended to restrict the network access to the cluster service port (default 9090) on a CloudStack management server host to only its peer CloudStack management server hosts. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.18.2.1, 4.19.0.2 or later, which addresses this issue.",

  "reference_content": "Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\n\nThe root cause is an unauthenticated cluster service port (default 9090) that allows the execution of arbitrary commands. Some of these commands have command injection vulnerabilities.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n\n*   **Unauthenticated Cluster Service Port:** The cluster service runs on an unauthenticated port (default 9090), allowing anyone who can reach the port to interact with it.\n*   **Command Injection:** Some commands executed through the cluster service have command injection vulnerabilities.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n\n*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on hypervisors and CloudStack management server hosts. This RCE is achieved through the cluster service and agents running on the hosts. These agents may run as a privileged user.\n*   **Complete Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the CloudStack managed infrastructure.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** An attacker must have network access to the unauthenticated cluster service port (default 9090).\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n\n*   **Network Reachability:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the cluster service port (default 9090), typically within the management network.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n*   The vulnerability allows for remote command execution on both the CloudStack management server and managed hypervisor hosts.\n*   The vulnerability exists because the cluster service port does not require authentication and because some of the commands sent to this port are vulnerable to command injection attacks.\n*   The provided content also mentions CVE-2024-39864.\n*   The vulnerability affects Apache CloudStack versions 4.0.0 through 4.18.2.0 and 4.19.0.0 through 4.19.0.1.\n*   The advisory recommends upgrading to versions 4.18.2.1 or 4.19.0.2 or later.\n*   If upgrading is not possible, restricting access to the cluster service port (default 9090) to only peer CloudStack management server hosts is recommended. Also restrict network access on CloudStack management hosts to essential ports.",

It is related to higher-level CWEs like CWE-77 (Command Injection) and CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')). The secondary CWE is CWE-306, which reflects the lack of authentication. CWE-306 is a child of CWE-287 (Improper Authentication). The selection of CWE-78 is preferred because the description explicitly mentions **command injection**, and CWE-78 provides a more specific context of OS command injection. The relationships highlight a potential chain where missing authentication (CWE-306) can precede command injection (CWE-78).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    cwe306[\"CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function\"]\n    cwe287[\"CWE-287: Improper Authentication\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n    cwe77 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    cwe306 -->|CHILDOF| cwe287\n    cwe306 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe78\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe306 secondary\n    class cwe77,cwe74,cwe287 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain begins with the **missing authentication** (CWE-306) on the cluster service port. This allows an attacker to send arbitrary commands, some of which are vulnerable to **command injection** (CWE-78). Successful exploitation leads to remote code execution and complete compromise of the CloudStack infrastructure.\nCWE-306 -> CWE-78 -> Remote Code Execution & Complete Compromise\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment identified **command injection** as a primary weakness, which led to the selection of CWE-78. The unauthenticated cluster service port was identified as a prerequisite condition, leading to the selection of CWE-306 as a secondary weakness. The analysis is heavily based on the provided evidence, specifically: \"The CloudStack cluster service runs on unauthenticated port (default 9090) that can be misused to run arbitrary commands... Some of these commands were found to have **command injection** vulnerabilities...\" and \"An attacker that can reach the cluster service on the unauthenticated port (default 9090), can exploit this to perform remote code execution...\".
