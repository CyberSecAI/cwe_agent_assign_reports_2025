# Raw Analyzer Response for CVE-2025-27399

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-285 | Improper Authorization | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-200 | Exposure of Sensitive Information | 0.7 | Class | Secondary | Allowed-with-Review |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** HIGH

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-285, Improper Authorization, a Class-level CWE. While more specific Base or Variant CWEs would be preferable, the available information doesn't allow for a more precise classification. CWE-200, Exposure of Sensitive Information, is a consequence of the authorization failure and is classified as a secondary weakness. CWE-285 has child CWEs which are more specific authorization issues, but the description does not have enough information to determine which child is the best fit.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with **improper authorization** (**CWE-285**), leading to the **exposure of sensitive information** (**CWE-200**). The **lack of a check** for approved users allows unapproved users to view domain block reasons.

## Summary of Analysis
The analysis is primarily based on the provided CVE description and the GitHub advisory summary. The key factor in the decision-making process was the **lack of proper authorization** check for unapproved users, which is the root cause. The consequence of this weakness is the **exposure of sensitive information**.

The selection of CWE-285 and CWE-200 is justified by the following evidence:

*   The GitHub advisory states that the root cause is that "The code does not check if a logged-in user is *approved* or has *confirmed their email address* when the visibility for domain blocks/reasons is set to 'users'."
*   The vulnerability allows "users that are not yet approved can view the block reasons". This aligns with **CWE-285 (Improper Authorization)** because the system incorrectly authorizes unapproved users to access domain block reasons.
*   The impact is that "Instance admins that do not want their domain blocks to be public...are impacted. Unapproved and unconfirmed users can view domain blocks intended only for approved users." This corresponds to **CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information)** because the vulnerability leads to the disclosure of domain block reasons to unauthorized users.

The retriever results also suggested CWE-863, Incorrect Authorization, but CWE-285 is preferred because it is the root cause of the authorization failure. CWE-863 is related to how authorization checks are performed, but it does not specify the underlying cause which is a **missing** check.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-201: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.76
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The system's authorization functionality does not prevent one user from gaining access to another user's data or record by modifying the key value identifying the data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.75
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-267: Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A particular privilege, role, capability, or right can be used to perform unsafe actions that were not intended, even when it is assigned to the correct entity.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action, but it does not correctly perform the check.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-346: Origin Validation Error
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:

## CWE-1390: Weak Authentication
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
