- **Product:** Go
- **Component:** Parse functions

## Analysis (with Relationship Data)

# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-674 | Uncontrolled Recursion | 0.9 | Class | Primary | Allowed-with-Review |
| CWE-770 | Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling | 0.6 | Base | Secondary | Allowed |
| CWE-400 | Uncontrolled Resource Consumption | 0.5 | Class | Secondary | Discouraged |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary relationship is that CWE-674 **Uncontrolled Recursion** is a Class-level CWE, while CWE-770 **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling** is a Base-level CWE and a parent of CWE-789 **Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value**. CWE-400 **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption** is a parent of CWE-770. The selection favors CWE-674 because the vulnerability description specifically mentions **stack exhaustion** caused by deeply nested literals, which is a direct indicator of uncontrolled recursion. However, it leads to uncontrolled resource consumption. Thus, CWE-770 and CWE-400 are also considered relevant.

## Vulnerability Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with parsing deeply nested literals, leading to **uncontrolled recursion**, which in turn causes **stack exhaustion**, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) due to a panic.
  - **Root Cause:** Deeply nested literals leading to **uncontrolled recursion** (CWE-674)
  - **Weakness:** **Stack exhaustion** due to uncontrolled resource allocation (CWE-770, CWE-400)
  - **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) via program panic

## Summary of Analysis
The initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability based on the provided description and CVE reference. The key phrase "**stack exhaustion**" strongly suggests **CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion** as the primary weakness. The retriever results also listed CWE-674 with a high similarity score. While CWE-770 and CWE-400 were also considered due to the resource allocation aspect, CWE-674 was chosen as the primary CWE because it directly addresses the recursive nature of the vulnerability.

The evidence from the vulnerability description: "Calling any of the Parse functions on Go source code which contains deeply nested literals can cause a panic due to **stack exhaustion**."

The graph relationships reinforce the idea that uncontrolled recursion can lead to resource exhaustion.

The selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they directly address the root cause (uncontrolled recursion) and the immediate consequence (**stack exhaustion**) of the vulnerability.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion
**Abstraction Level**: Class
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not properly control the amount of recursion that takes place,  consuming excessive resources, such as allocated memory or the program stack.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed-with-Review
- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate

## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product allocates memory based on an untrusted, large size value, but it does not ensure that the size is within expected limits, allowing arbitrary amounts of memory to be allocated.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1286: Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.67
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product receives input that is expected to be well-formed - i.e., to comply with a certain syntax - but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.65
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-126: Buffer Over-read
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.65
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads from a buffer using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.65
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to unauthorized actors.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-1325: Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.65
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.65
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 0.65
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.65
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.

## CWE-789: Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value
**Abstraction Level**: Variant
**Similarity Score**: 906.16
**Source**: sparse
