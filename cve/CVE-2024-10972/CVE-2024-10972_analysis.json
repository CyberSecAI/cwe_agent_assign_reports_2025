  "description": "Velocidex WinPmem versions 4.1 and below suffer from an **Improper Input Validation** vulnerability whereby an attacker with admin access can trigger a BSODwith a parallel thread changing the memorys access right under the control of the user-mode application. This is due to verification only being performed at the beginning of the routine allowing theuserspace to change page permissions half way through the routine. A valid workaround is a rule to detect unauthorized loading of winpmem outside incident response operations.",

The **improper input validation** is due to the resource's state changing between the check and the use, which is a **TOCTOU** race condition. |\n| CWE-284 | Improper Access Control | 0.6 | Class | Allowed-with-Review | Secondary. An attacker with admin access is required to trigger the vulnerability, indicating a potential access control issue. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.75\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE is CWE-367, which is a Base level CWE. CWE-367 is related to CWE-362 (Race Condition), which is a Class level CWE, through a ChildOf relationship. It is also related to CWE-667 (Improper Locking) which is a Class level CWE, as a CANPRECEDE relationship.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe367[\"CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\"]\n    cwe362[\"CWE-362: Race Condition\"]\n    cwe667[\"CWE-667: Improper Locking\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n\n    cwe367 -->|CHILDOF| cwe362\n    cwe667 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe367\n    \n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe367 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper input validation** due to a **TOCTOU** race condition (CWE-367). This allows an attacker with admin access to change memory access rights, leading to a BSOD. The requirement for admin access suggests a secondary issue of **improper access control** (CWE-284).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is **improper input validation** in the form of a **TOCTOU** race condition (CWE-367). The vulnerability description explicitly states that verification is performed only at the beginning of the routine, allowing userspace to change page permissions halfway through, leading to a BSOD. This directly matches the description of CWE-367. The fact that the attacker needs admin access hints that there might be other access control issues.\n\nThe choice of CWE-367 is at the Base level, providing more specific information than its parent class.\n\nCWEs Considered but Not Used:\n\n*   CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), CWE-1390 (Weak Authentication), and CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) were considered but deemed less relevant because the core issue is not related to authentication or authorization, but rather the timing issue in input validation.\n*   CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) was added as a secondary candidate, but not as the primary because **improper input validation** is the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a protection mechanism that relies on the existence or values of an input, but the input can be modified by an untrusted actor in a way that bypasses the protection mechanism.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check.
