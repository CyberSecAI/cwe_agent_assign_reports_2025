The exploitation of the CSRF vulnerability leads to **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**. Therefore, CWE-352 can precede CWE-79.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n    \n    cwe352 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe79\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**, which allows an attacker to induce a privileged user to perform actions they did not intend. This leads to **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**, resulting in stored XSS.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description indicates a **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability that leads to **Stored XSS**. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" confirms that the root cause is **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**, which allows a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.\n\nThe retriever results show CWE-79 as the top candidate, followed by CWE-352. However, given that the description explicitly states the vulnerability starts with **CSRF** that leads to XSS, CWE-352 is the primary cause, leading to CWE-79 as a secondary effect.\n\nThe selection is based on the evidence provided in the vulnerability description and the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" which clearly identifies **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** as the root cause that leads to XSS.
