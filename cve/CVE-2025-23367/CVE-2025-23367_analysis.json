  "description": "A flaw was found in the Wildfly Server Role Based Access Control (RBAC) provider. When authorization to control management operations is secured using the Role Based Access Control provider, a user without the required privileges can suspend or resume the server. A user with a Monitor or Auditor role is supposed to have only read access permissions and should not be able to suspend the server. The vulnerability is caused by the Suspend and Resume handlers not performing authorization checks to validate whether the current user has the required permissions to proceed with the action.",

CWE-862 is more specific and accurately reflects the vulnerability where the Suspend and Resume handlers do not perform authorization checks. CWE-284 is a more general term and less preferred when a more specific CWE is available.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe862 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe862 primary\n    class cwe284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **missing authorization** check in the Suspend and Resume handlers (CWE-862), which allows a user without the required privileges to suspend or resume the server. The impact is that unauthorized users can suspend the server, causing a denial-of-service condition.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and the CVE reference links content summary. The key phrase \"Suspend and Resume handlers not performing authorization checks\" directly indicates **missing authorization**, aligning with CWE-862. The guidance provided under Authentication vs Authorization vs Access Control section also points to this decision, as it highlights that CWE-862 is about a lack of **authorization** after authentication.\n\nCWE-862 is at the Class level of abstraction, but it is more specific than CWE-284, which is at the Pillar level. The evidence supports the selection of CWE-862 as the primary CWE due to the explicit mention of **missing authorization** checks.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product incorrectly assigns a privilege to a particular actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Reason not selected**: Incorrect privilege assignment is not the root cause.
