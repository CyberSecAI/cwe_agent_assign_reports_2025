## Vulnerability Description
runofast Indoor Security Camera for Baby Monitor has a **default password** of password for the root account. This allows access to the /stream1 URI via the rtsp// protocol to receive the video and audio stream.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **default password**
- **impact:** access video and audio stream
- **vector:** /stream1 URI via rtsp protocol
- **product:** runofast Indoor Security Camera for Baby Monitor
- **component:** root account

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Runofast 10$ baby camera with firmware version CloudCam 57.0.0.1 has hardcoded default credentials (`root:password`) for its RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol) service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The most critical vulnerability is the presence of unchangeable, hardcoded credentials. These are easily discoverable and widely known, representing a significant security flaw.
*   **Lack of Authentication Enforcement:** The RTSP service allows access with default credentials, indicating a lack of proper authentication enforcement.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Video Feed:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the camera's live video feed by using the default credentials.
*   **Privacy Violation:** This constitutes a major privacy violation, as the camera's video feed can be viewed without the owner's consent.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** With access to the video feed, attackers could potentially identify other vulnerabilities or gather intelligence for more sophisticated attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the camera, which could be within the same local network or through port forwarding on a router.
*   **RTSP Protocol:** The attack leverages the RTSP protocol, specifically port 554 and potentially 8001, to establish a connection and stream video.
*   **Default Credentials:** The attacker uses the default `root:password` credentials to authenticate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable camera.
*   **Knowledge of RTSP:** Some knowledge of RTSP protocol and tools like `ffmpeg` are required.
*   **Default Credential Information:**  The attacker must know the default credentials which, in this case, are basic and likely on wordlists.

**Additional Details:**

* The attacker used `nmap` to identify open ports, including 80 (HTTP), 554 (RTSP), and 8001 (which also turned out to be RTSP).
* The attacker demonstrated exploitation using the `ffmpeg` command to stream video from the camera using the default credentials.
* The attacker was unable to change the camera's default credentials, confirming they are hardcoded and likely unchangeable.

This blog post provides significantly more detail and a practical demonstration than the general placeholder description of the CVE, showing exactly how the camera can be compromised.
