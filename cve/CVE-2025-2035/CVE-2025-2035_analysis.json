This direct mapping provides high confidence.\n\nCWE-434 is selected as the primary CWE because the vulnerability description explicitly mentions \"**unrestricted upload**\". This direct correspondence makes it the most accurate and specific CWE for the vulnerability.\n\nOther CWEs Considered but Not Used:\n\n*   CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')): While SQL injection is a common vulnerability, there is no evidence in the description to support this.\n*   CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')): Similar to SQL injection, there is no evidence of XSS in the provided description.\n*   CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path): This is related to file operations but is not the primary **weakness** described.
