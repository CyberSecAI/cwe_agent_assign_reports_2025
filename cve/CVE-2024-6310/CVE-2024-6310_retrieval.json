This is due to missing nonce validation in the admin_init_AAPL function and missing file type validation in the AAPL_options_validate function.

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    The Advanced AJAX Page Loader plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery to **Arbitrary File Upload** in versions up to, and including, 2.7.7. This is due to missing nonce validation in the admin_init_AAPL function and missing file type validation in the AAPL_options_validate function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: '['missing nonce validation''\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
