## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability has been identified in SINEC INS (All versions < V1.0 SP2 Update 3). The affected application **does not properly restrict the size of generated log files**. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger a large amount of logged events to exhaust the systems resources and create a denial of service condition.
