  "query": "A vulnerability has been identified within Rancher where a cluster or node driver can be used to escape the chroot jail and gain root access to the Rancher container itself. In production environments, further privilege escalation is possible based on living off the land within the Rancher container itself. For the test and development environments, based on a privileged Docker container, it is possible to escape the Docker container and gain execution access on the host system. This issue affects rancher from 2.7.0 before 2.7.16, from 2.8.0 before 2.8.9, from 2.9.0 before 2.9.3.",
