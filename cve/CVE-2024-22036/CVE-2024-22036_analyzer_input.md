# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2024-22036

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability has been identified within Rancher where a cluster or node driver can be used to **escape the chroot jail** and gain root access to the Rancher container itself. In production environments, further privilege escalation is possible based on living off the land within the Rancher container itself. For the test and development environments, based on a privileged Docker container, it is possible to escape the Docker container and gain execution access on the host system. This issue affects rancher from 2.7.0 before 2.7.16, from 2.8.0 before 2.8.9, from 2.9.0 before 2.9.3.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **rootcause:** **cluster or node driver vulnerability**
- **weakness:** **escape the chroot jail**
- **product:** rancher
- **impact:** gain root access to the Rancher container itself, escape the Docker container and gain execution access on the host system, privilege escalation
- **version:** 2.7.0 before 2.7.16, 2.8.0 before 2.8.9, 2.9.0 before 2.9.3

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
```
Root cause of vulnerability:
*   During startup, Rancher appends the `/opt/drivers/management-state/bin` directory to the `PATH` environment variable.
*   The binaries `/usr/bin/rancher-machine`, `/usr/bin/helm_v3`, and `/usr/bin/kustomize` are assigned a UID of 1001 and a GID of 127 instead of being owned by the root user.
*   Rancher employs a jail mechanism to isolate the execution of node drivers from the main process. However, the drivers are executed with excessive permissions.
*   During the registration of new node drivers, its binary is executed with the same user as the parent process, which could enable an attacker to gain elevated privileges by registering a malicious driver.
*   Lack of validation on the driver file type, which allows symbolic links to be used.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
*   A cluster or node driver can be used to escape the `chroot` jail and gain root access to the Rancher container.
*   Privilege escalation.
*   Remote Code Execution (RCE).

Impact of exploitation:
*   In production environments, further privilege escalation is possible.
*   In test and development environments, it is possible to escape the Docker container and gain execution access on the host system.

Attack vectors:
*   Registering a malicious driver.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
*   An attacker must be able to register or control a malicious cluster or node driver.

Mitigation or fix:
*   Remove the step that appends `/opt/drivers/management-state/bin` to the `PATH` environment variable.
*   Correct the permission of the binaries `/usr/bin/rancher-machine`, `/usr/bin/helm_v3`, and `/usr/bin/kustomize` so that they are owned by the root user.
*   A new group `jail-accessors` has been created, and the rancher user has been added to this group.
*   The `jail-accessors` group is granted read and execute permissions for the directories `/var/lib/rancher`, `/var/lib/cattle`, and `/usr/local/bin`.
*   The jail mechanism has been enhanced to execute commands using the non-root `rancher` user and the `jail-accessors` group. Additionally, a new setting, `UnprivilegedJailUser`, has been introduced to manage this behavior, allowing users to opt-out if they need to run drivers in a more privileged context.
*   Limit the devices copied to the jail directory to a minimal set.
*   The `NewPlugin(driver)` function in the `rancher/machine` module has been updated to allow setting the UID and GID for starting the plugin server. If the environment variables `MACHINE_PLUGIN_UID` and `MACHINE_PLUGIN_GID` are set, their values will be used to configure the user credentials for launching the plugin server.
*   Rancher now sets these environment variables with a non-root UID and GID before invoking the `NewPlugin(driver)` function and then unsets them after retrieving the creation flags.
*   The `driver` package has been revised to verify that the downloaded driver binary is a regular file.
*   The `driver` package has been revised to verify that the target file in the downloaded tar file is a regular file.
*   The `driver` package now executes the downloaded driver binary within a jail, with a default timeout of 5 seconds.
*   The helm package has been updated to ensure appropriate permissions are set on the generated kubeconfig file.
*   The `nodeConfig` package has been updated to ensure proper permissions are applied when extracting the node configuration.
*   Patched versions include releases `2.7.16`, `2.8.9` and `2.9.3`.
*   If you can't upgrade to a fixed version, please make sure that:
    *   Drivers are only executed from trusted sources.
    *   The use of Admins/Restricted Admins is limited to trusted users.

## CWE Classification Guidance

The following guidance has been automatically included because relevant keywords were detected in the vulnerability description:

### Privileges vs Permissions Guidance

## ===Guidance===

### Level Set – Privileges vs Permissions (in Access Control Context)

**Privileges**

* Represents the *actor's identity level* or capabilities (e.g., root, admin, regular user, guest).
* Commonly defined by roles or security contexts assigned during session creation or login.
* Often involved in **privilege escalation** (e.g., a regular user gaining admin rights).
* 🔍 *Who* the user is and *what they are supposed to be able to do.*

**Permissions**

* Represents *what actions are allowed* on specific resources (files, services, APIs).
* Usually attached to *resources*, not people.
* Permissions can be affected dynamically by changes in role or context.
* 🔍 *What* the user is allowed to do to *which resource.*

#### Short Rule:

> **Privileges** = rights assigned to a user role
> **Permissions** = access rules applied to specific objects/resources

---

### Mapping Discussion – CWE Usage for Privileges vs Permissions

#### 🔸 CWE-266: **Incorrect Privilege Assignment**

* The system assigns incorrect privileges to a user (e.g., admin instead of guest).
* Often the result of misconfigured roles or faulty logic during account provisioning.
* ✅ *“A user created with the ‘guest’ role was assigned admin privileges due to a logic flaw.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-250: **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**

* Code runs with higher privileges than needed to complete its function.
* Often found in daemons, services, or mobile apps that don't drop privileges.
* ✅ *“The backup service runs as root but only needs read access.”*

#### 🔸 CWE-284: **Improper Access Control** (Parent/Generic)

* Used when the system fails to enforce restrictions on access to resources.
* If no specific privilege or permission mistake is identifiable, use this.
* ⚠️ This is **often overused**. Only default to 284 if children like 285 or 266 don't fit.

#### 🔸 CWE-285: **Improper Authorization**

* A subset of access control failures where the system incorrectly allows an action based on flawed permission checking.
* Think: "The check is there but doesn't work properly."
* ✅ *“User can access another user’s invoice due to logic flaw in role verification.”*

## Mapping Examples – Privilege Issues

### Bad Mapping Example (Incorrect use of CWE-269):

> *“User can escalate privileges to admin.”*
> ❌ Mapping: CWE-269 (*discouraged – only shows technical impact, not cause*)
> ✅ Correct mapping (if cause known):

* Misconfigured roles: **CWE-266**
* Permission not dropped after privilege change: **CWE-250**
* Role-check bypass via logic flaw: **CWE-863**

## Good Mapping Examples – Privileges & Permissions

* ✅ **CWE-266**: *“When a new user registers, the system assigns them admin role due to a missing role validation.”*
* ✅ **CWE-250**: *“Installer runs with system-level privileges but doesn't require them to install files in the user directory.”*
* ✅ **CWE-284**: *“Inconsistent access rules between UI and backend for sensitive endpoints.”*
* ✅ **CWE-285**: *“Authorization logic fails to restrict access to finance reports based on department.”*
