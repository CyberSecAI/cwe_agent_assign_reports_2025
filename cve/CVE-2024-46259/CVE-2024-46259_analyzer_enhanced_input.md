## Vulnerability Description
cute_png v1.05 was discovered to contain a **heap buffer overflow** via the cp_unfilter() function at cute_png.h.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **heap buffer overflow**
- **product:** cute_png
- **version:** v1.05
- **component:** cp_unfilter() function at cute_png.h

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-buffer-overflow occurs due to a read access out of bounds in the `cp_unfilter` function at line 1019 of `cute_png.h` version 1.05.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: A read operation attempts to access memory beyond the allocated buffer in the heap.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability leads to a crash due to memory corruption, as reported by AddressSanitizer.
- Potentially, this could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution depending on the context of the application using this library, however, the provided information does not elaborate on this.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted PNG image. The `cp_load_png_mem` and `cp_load_png` functions use the vulnerable `cp_unfilter` function.
- An attacker can provide a malicious PNG file that triggers the heap-buffer-overflow during the unfiltering process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted PNG file to be processed by an application that uses the vulnerable `cute_png` library.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `cute_png.h` version 1.05.
- The provided code shows the exact line and function where the overflow occurs with the address and call stack.
- The included `poc_demo.c` file, when compiled and run with the malicious `sample6.png`, triggers the vulnerability.
- The environment used for reproduction is Ubuntu 22.04 with a specific kernel and gcc version.

In summary, this is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `cp_unfilter` function within the `cute_png` library, triggered by a malformed PNG file.
