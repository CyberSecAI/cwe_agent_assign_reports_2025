## Vulnerability Description
An issue was discovered in Insyde InsydeH2O kernel 5.2 before version 05.29.50, kernel 5.3 before version 05.38.50, kernel 5.4 before version 05.46.50, kernel 5.5 before version 05.54.50, kernel 5.6 before version 05.61.50, and kernel 5.7 before version 05.70.50. In VariableRuntimeDxe driver, **SecureBootHandler uses DataSize and VariableNameSize when determining if the data or name are in the buffer, but these are supplied by the caller and therefore cannot be trusted**.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## CVE-2024-52880 Analysis

**RELATION TO CVE:** RELATED

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** In VariableRuntimeDxe driver, SecureBootHandler uses DataSize and VariableNameSize when determining if the data or name are in the buffer, but these are supplied by the caller and therefore cannot be trusted.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-349 (Improper Validation of Data from Untrusted Source)
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Not explicitly stated, but implied to be potentially significant due to the untrusted data being used for buffer size checks.
*   **Attack vectors:** Not explicitly stated, but likely involves providing malicious data as input to the SecureBootHandler.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires the ability to provide input to the SecureBootHandler, potentially through a crafted variable.
*   **Mitigation or fix:** kernel 5.2, Version 05.29.50

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content provides more detail than the official CVE description, specifically identifying the vulnerable component (SecureBootHandler within VariableRuntimeDxe) and the root cause (untrusted data used for buffer size checks).
*   The CVSS score is not provided in the CVE description but is listed as 7.5 in the provided content.
