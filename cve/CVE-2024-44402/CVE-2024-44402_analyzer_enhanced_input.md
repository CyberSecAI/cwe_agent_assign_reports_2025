### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **command injection**
- **product:** D-Link DI-8100G
- **version:** 17.12.20A1
- **component:** msp_info.htm

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a command injection flaw located in the `DI_8100G-17.12.20A1` firmware. Specifically, it is found within the `msp_info.htm` file which calls the `sub_457A6C` function of the `jhttpd` web service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is that the `path` parameter, when manipulated, allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system. This is because the application is not sanitizing or validating the input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. This can lead to a range of impacts, including:
    - Complete system compromise
    - Data exfiltration
    - Denial of service
    - Installation of malware

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Path Parameter Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `path` parameter sent to the `msp_info.htm` endpoint. The `sub_457A6C` function within the `jhttpd` service processes the path parameter without proper sanitization or validation, leading to command injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable `msp_info.htm` endpoint. This suggests that the attacker would likely need to be on the same network as the device or have the ability to reach the device through the network.
- An attacker needs to know how to manipulate the path parameter to inject OS commands.
