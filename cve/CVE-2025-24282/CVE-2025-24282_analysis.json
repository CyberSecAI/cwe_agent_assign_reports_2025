The vulnerability allows an app to modify protected parts of the file system, indicating an issue with how permissions are inherited or managed. |\n| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | 0.6 | Class | Discouraged | Secondary candidate. The CVE reference mentions improved input sanitization as a fix. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.7\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary CWE, CWE-277 (Insecure Inherited Permissions), is a variant-level CWE, providing a specific classification. CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) is a class-level CWE and a parent of CWE-1287 (Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input), but is considered a secondary candidate as it is more general. The vulnerability description points towards an issue related to permissions, making CWE-277 a more direct fit.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe277[\"CWE-277: Insecure Inherited Permissions\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe1287[\"CWE-1287: Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input\"]\n\n    cwe1287 -->|CHILDOF| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe277 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain involves a **library injection** (**weakness**) leading to the ability to modify protected parts of the file system (**impact**). The root cause is likely related to how permissions are handled during library loading or execution, represented by CWE-277 (Insecure Inherited Permissions). Improved input sanitization (mentioned in the CVE reference) can be related to CWE-20, but this is a secondary weakness.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary assessment is based on the vulnerability allowing an app to modify protected parts of the file system, which strongly suggests a permission-related issue. The **library injection** **weakness** allows the **impact** of modifying protected parts of the file system. The CVE reference mentions improved input sanitization as a fix, making CWE-20 a secondary candidate. CWE-277 is at the optimal level of specificity because it directly addresses the insecure inheritance of permissions.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-277: Insecure Inherited Permissions\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.73\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA product defines a set of insecure permissions that are inherited by objects that are created by the program.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 398.31\n**Source**: sparse\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input or data, but it does\n        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the\n        properties that are required to process the data safely and\n        correctly.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-20 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available [REF-1287].
