# Vulnerability Information: CVE-2025-0204

## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in code-projects Online Shoe Store 1.0. It has been rated as critical. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /details.php. The manipulation of the argument id leads to **sql injection**. The attack may be initiated remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **sql injection**
- **vector:** manipulation of id argument
- **product:** Online Shoe Store
- **version:** 1.0
- **component:** /details.php

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `$id` parameter in the `/details.php` file of an online shoe store application. The application directly incorporates the user-supplied `$id` parameter into an SQL query without any filtering.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the `id` parameter before using it in an SQL query.
*   **Direct SQL Query Construction:** The application directly embeds user-controlled data into the SQL query string.
*   **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The application does not use prepared statements or parameterized queries, which are crucial for preventing SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Database Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the server's database, potentially viewing, modifying, or deleting sensitive data.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** As mentioned, exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability can potentially lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server, allowing an attacker to gain complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter in a GET request to `/details.php`.
    Example:  `/details.php?id=1' OR '1'='1` or `id=1 UNION SELECT ...`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have some basic knowledge of SQL syntax to craft malicious payloads.

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided PoC demonstrates the use of `sqlmap` to enumerate databases and obtain an OS shell, which highlights the severity of the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerable code snippet is provided:
    ```php
    <?php
      if(isset($_GET['id'])){
      $id = $_GET['id'];
      $query = $conn->query("SELECT * FROM product WHERE product_id = '$id' ");
      $row = $query->fetch_array();
    ?>
    ```
    This clearly shows how the unsanitized `$id` variable is directly used in the SQL query.
*   The vulnerable application is an online shoe store project, available from code-projects.org.

This detailed analysis provides more specific information than a general CVE description typically does.
