## Vulnerability Description
**Memory safety bugs** present in Firefox 132, Firefox ESR 128.4, and Thunderbird 128.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of **memory corruption** and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 133, Firefox ESR < 128.5, Thunderbird < 133, and Thunderbird < 128.5.
