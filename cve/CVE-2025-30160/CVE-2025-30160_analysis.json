  "description": "Redlib is an alternative private front-end to Reddit. A vulnerability has been identified in Redlib where an attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DOS) condition by submitting a specially crafted base2048-encoded DEFLATE decompression bomb to the restore_preferences form. This leads to excessive memory consumption and potential system instability, which can be exploited to disrupt Redlib instances. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.36.0.",

It provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from the lack of size limits on the decompression of user-supplied data in the `restore_preferences` form. Specifically, a base2048-encoded DEFLATE decompression bomb can be submitted.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** The application doesn't limit the amount of memory used during decompression.\n*   **DEFLATE Bomb:**  Susceptibility to a DEFLATE decompression bomb, where a small compressed input expands to a very large uncompressed output.\n*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application doesn't validate the size of the input before decompression.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Excessive memory consumption can lead to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions, OS-level resource exhaustion, and system crashes.\n*   **System Instability:** Repeated exploitation can keep the target system in a degraded state.\n*   **Disruption of Service:** Public instances of Redlib can be rendered unavailable.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.\n*   **`restore_preferences` form:**  An attacker submits a malicious payload to the `/settings/encoded-restore` route.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Redlib instance.\n*   **No Privileges Required:** No authentication or special privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Upgrade to v0.36.0:** The vulnerability is patched in version 0.36.0.\n*   **Workarounds (until patching):**\n    *   Implement request size limits at the web server or application level.\n    *   Disable or restrict the `/settings/encoded-restore` route.\n    *   Monitor server logs for unusually large requests and block offending IPs.\n*   **Code Changes:** The fix involved adding a timeout to the decompression process and limiting the size of the input.

While CWE-400 is a high-level classification, CWE-770 better describes the root cause of the vulnerability, which is allocating resources (memory) without proper limits, leading to excessive consumption.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe770[\"CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling\"]\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    \n    cwe770 -->|CHILDOF| cwe400\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe770 primary\n    class cwe400 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the lack of resource limits, leading to excessive memory consumption and culminating in a denial-of-service condition.\n\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling (CWE-770)**: The application **does not limit** the amount of memory allocated during decompression.\n2.  **Resulting Weakness:** Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400): The excessive memory allocation leads to resource exhaustion.\n3.  **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS): The resource exhaustion causes the system to become unavailable.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided vulnerability description and CVE reference summary. The evidence clearly points to the root cause being the lack of limits on resource allocation during decompression, leading to a denial-of-service.\n\nThe selection of CWE-770 as the primary CWE is justified by its specificity and its accurate representation of the root cause. The CVE reference summary explicitly mentions **\"Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"** and notes that the application **doesn't limit** the amount of memory used during decompression. This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-770 **(Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling)**.\n\nCWE-400 **(Uncontrolled Resource Consumption)** was considered but deemed less specific. While it accurately describes the impact of the vulnerability, it does not pinpoint the root cause as precisely as CWE-770. The MITRE mapping guidance discourages the use of CWE-400 in cases where a more specific CWE is available.\n\nThe chosen CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity because they accurately reflect the root cause and impact of the vulnerability, respectively, based on the available evidence.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as
