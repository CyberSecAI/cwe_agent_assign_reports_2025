  "reference_content": "## Analysis of CVE-2025-2662 Content\n\nBased on the provided content, this report details a SQL injection vulnerability in \"projectworlds Online Time Table Generator Portal-Source code\".\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the 'course' parameter in the `student/studentdashboard.php` file.  The application directly uses this parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   SQL Injection\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Unauthorized database access\n*   Sensitive data leakage\n*   Data tampering\n*   System control\n*   Service interruption\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The 'course' parameter in the `student/studentdashboard.php` file is vulnerable.  The provided payload demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection attack using `sqlmap`.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the `student/studentdashboard.php` endpoint.\n*   Knowledge of SQL injection techniques and tools like `sqlmap` is beneficial.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\n*   **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:** This separates SQL code from user input, preventing the input from being interpreted as code.\n*   **Input validation and filtering:**  Strictly validate and filter user input to ensure it conforms to the expected format.\n*   **Minimize database user permissions:** Use database accounts with the least necessary privileges.\n*   **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular code and system security audits.\n\n**Additional Details (More than official CVE description):**\n\n*   The report provides a specific payload example using `sqlmap` to demonstrate the vulnerability.\n*   It includes a sample HTTP POST request that can be used to exploit the vulnerability.\n*   It details the vulnerable file (`student/studentdashboard.php`) and parameter (`course`).\n*   The report also provides links to the vendor's homepage and the software download location.\n*   The report includes screenshots from `sqlmap` showing successful database enumeration.",

CWE-89 is a base level CWE, providing a specific description of the **improper neutralization** of SQL special elements. While CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')) is a broader class, CWE-89 offers a more precise categorization, aligning with the vulnerability description. There are no significant chain relationships that influence the mapping in this case.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe89[\"CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\"]\n    cwe74[\"CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\"]\n    \n    cwe89 -->|CHILDOF| cwe74\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe89 primary\n    class cwe74 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper neutralization** of input, leading directly to SQL Injection.\n1.  **Root Cause:** **Improper Neutralization** of special elements used in an SQL command. (CWE-89)\n2.  **Impact:** SQL Injection vulnerability, allowing unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, system control, and service interruption.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability is clearly a SQL Injection vulnerability, which is caused by **improper neutralization** of special elements in the `course` parameter. The primary CWE, CWE-89, directly addresses this weakness. The evidence is strong, with the vulnerability description and CVE details clearly stating the presence of SQL Injection and the **lack of input validation**. The retriever results also strongly suggest CWE-89 as the most relevant. The relationship analysis indicates that CWE-89 is a specific type of injection, making it more appropriate than the more general CWE-74. The decision is based on direct evidence and the specific nature of the weakness described.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
