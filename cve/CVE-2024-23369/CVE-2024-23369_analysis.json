Memory corruption due to invalid length. |\n| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | The length of the request/response buffers is not properly validated. Contributing factor to the out-of-bounds write. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-787, which is a base-level CWE. The secondary weakness, CWE-1284, can precede CWE-787. This relationship suggests that **improper validation** of the input quantity (length) can lead to an **out-of-bounds write**.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n    cwe1284[\"CWE-1284: Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\"]\n    \n    cwe1284 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe787\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe787 primary\n    class cwe1284 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n1.  **Root Cause:** Invalid length provided from HLOS, leading to **Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input** (CWE-1284).\n2.  **Weakness:** This leads to writing outside the allocated buffer.\n3.  **Impact:** **Out-of-bounds Write** (CWE-787) resulting in **memory corruption**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe vulnerability description states \"**Memory corruption** when invalid length is provided from HLOS for FRS/UDS request/response buffers.\" This clearly indicates an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) is occurring due to the use of an invalid length. This is further reinforced by the retriever results, which list CWE-787 as the top candidate. The lack of proper validation of the input length (CWE-1284) contributes to the root cause, and enables the vulnerability.\n\nCWE-1284 \"Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input\" is a contributing factor because the invalid length provided from HLOS is not properly validated.\n\nThe selection of CWE-787 and CWE-1284 is based on the evidence provided and the retriever results.
