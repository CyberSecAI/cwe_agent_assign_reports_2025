# Summary
| CWE ID | CWE Name | Confidence | CWE Abstraction Level | CWE Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CWE-787 | Out-of-bounds Write | 0.9 | Base | Allowed | Primary CWE. Memory corruption due to invalid length. |
| CWE-1284 | Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input | 0.6 | Base | Allowed | The length of the request/response buffers is not properly validated. Contributing factor to the out-of-bounds write. |

## Evidence and Confidence

*   **Confidence Score:** 0.8
*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM

## Relationship Analysis
The primary weakness is CWE-787, which is a base-level CWE. The secondary weakness, CWE-1284, can precede CWE-787. This relationship suggests that **improper validation** of the input quantity (length) can lead to an **out-of-bounds write**.

## Vulnerability Chain
1.  **Root Cause:** Invalid length provided from HLOS, leading to **Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input** (CWE-1284).
2.  **Weakness:** This leads to writing outside the allocated buffer.
3.  **Impact:** **Out-of-bounds Write** (CWE-787) resulting in **memory corruption**.

## Summary of Analysis
The vulnerability description states "**Memory corruption** when invalid length is provided from HLOS for FRS/UDS request/response buffers." This clearly indicates an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) is occurring due to the use of an invalid length. This is further reinforced by the retriever results, which list CWE-787 as the top candidate. The lack of proper validation of the input length (CWE-1284) contributes to the root cause, and enables the vulnerability.

CWE-1284 "Improper Validation of Specified Quantity in Input" is a contributing factor because the invalid length provided from HLOS is not properly validated.

The selection of CWE-787 and CWE-1284 is based on the evidence provided and the retriever results. Both CWEs are at the Base level of abstraction, which is the preferred level.

Relevant CWE Information:

# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)
The following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:

## CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.74
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product uses a sequential operation to read or write a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.73
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.72
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-191: Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.71
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product subtracts one value from another, such that the result is less than the minimum allowable integer value, which produces a value that is not equal to the correct result.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-193: Off-by-one Error
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
A product calculates or uses an incorrect maximum or minimum value that is 1 more, or 1 less, than the correct value.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
**Source**: dense

**Description**:
The product writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.

**Mapping Guidance**:
- Usage: Allowed
- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.



## CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset
**Abstraction Level**: Base
**Similarity Score**: 0.70
