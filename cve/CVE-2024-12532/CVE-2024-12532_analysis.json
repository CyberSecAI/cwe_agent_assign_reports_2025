While it's generally preferred to use Base or Variant level CWEs, in this case, the description aligns well with the general nature of CWE-200. There are no specific details that would allow us to narrow it down further. The hierarchical relationships show that CWE-200 can be caused by various other weaknesses such as **missing authorization** (CWE-862), which is also present here.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe200[\"CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor\"]\n    cwe862[\"CWE-862: Missing Authorization\"]\n\n    cwe862 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe200\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe200 primary\n    class cwe862 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing authorization** (CWE-862), which leads to **exposure of sensitive information** (CWE-200).\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis is based on the provided evidence which explicitly states that the vulnerability involves **Sensitive Information Exposure** due to the plugin making it possible for authenticated attackers to extract sensitive data.\n\nThe retriever results also point to CWE-200 and related authorization issues. While more specific CWEs could potentially exist, the provided information is best captured by the general nature of CWE-200. CWE-862 is a secondary weakness contributing to the primary weakness of CWE-200.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application

information.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n-

0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized
