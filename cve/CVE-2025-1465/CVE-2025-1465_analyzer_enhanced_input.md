## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
## Analysis of CVE-2025-1465 Content

Based on the provided content, this relates to a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in LMXCMS version 1.41. The content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the ability to delete the `install_ok.txt` lock file, allowing a system reset during database configuration. This enables an attacker to inject a web shell into the database configuration file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Arbitrary file deletion
*   Lack of proper input validation/sanitization during database configuration.
*   Directory traversal vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to gain control of the web server.

**Attack vectors:**

1.  Access the admin panel's database backup and restore module using valid account credentials.
2.  Utilize the backup feature to select any table.
3.  Use the restore backup feature to access the file deletion interface.
4.  Delete the `install_ok.txt` file using directory traversal.
5.  Inject a malicious payload (web shell) into the table prefix input field during database configuration.
6.  Execute arbitrary code on the website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Valid account credentials to access the admin panel.
*   Understanding of directory traversal techniques.
*   Ability to craft a malicious payload (web shell).

**Mitigation or fix:**

The content does not provide specific mitigation or fix details. However, it implies that proper input validation, secure file handling, and prevention of directory traversal are necessary to address the vulnerability.
