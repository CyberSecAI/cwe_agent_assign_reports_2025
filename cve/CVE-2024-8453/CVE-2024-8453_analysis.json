CWE-759 and CWE-760 are both children of CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) and represent more specific scenarios related to the use of one-way hashes without a salt or with a predictable salt, respectively.

The description states: \"Certain switch models from PLANET Technology use an **insecure hashing function** to hash user passwords without being salted. Remote attackers with administrator privileges can read configuration files to obtain the hash values, and potentially crack them to retrieve the plaintext passwords.\" This statement directly supports the selection of CWE-328 (Use of Weak Hash) as the primary CWE. The description also mentions the absence of salting which is addressed by CWE-759 and CWE-760.\n\nThe retriever results also support CWE-328 as a top candidate. While other CWEs like CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort) and CWE-522 (Insufficiently Protected Credentials) were considered, CWE-328 is a more direct representation of the **root cause**, which is the use of a weak hashing algorithm. CWE-759 and CWE-760 address the specific weakness of missing or predictable salt values, which are contributing factors.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-328 accurately captures the use of a weak hashing algorithm. CWE-759 and CWE-760 highlight the compounding factors of missing or predictable salts.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product generates a hash for a password, but it uses a scheme that does not provide a sufficient level of computational effort that would make password cracking attacks infeasible or expensive.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n\n\n## CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.75\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses an algorithm that produces a digest (output value) that does not meet security expectations for a hash function that allows an adversary to reasonably determine the original input (preimage attack), find another input that can produce the same hash (2nd preimage attack), or find multiple inputs that evaluate to the same hash (birthday attack).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-274: Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles when it has insufficient privileges to perform an operation, leading to resultant weaknesses.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry could be deprecated in a future version of CWE.\n\n\n\n## CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses insufficiently random numbers or values in a security context that depends on unpredictable numbers.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
