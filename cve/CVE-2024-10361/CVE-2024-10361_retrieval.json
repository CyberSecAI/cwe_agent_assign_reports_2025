This vulnerability arises from **improper input validation**, allowing **path traversal** techniques to delete arbitrary files on the server. Attackers can exploit this to bypass security mechanisms and delete files outside the intended directory, including critical system files, user data, or application resources. This vulnerability impacts the integrity and availability of the system.', key_phrases={'rootcause': 'improper input validation', 'weakness': ['arbitrary file deletion', 'path traversal'], 'impact': ['bypass security mechanisms and delete files outside the intended directory', 'availability', 'integrity'], 'vector': '', 'attacker': 'attackers', 'product': 'danny-avila/librechat', 'version': 'v0.7.5-rc2', 'component': '/api/files endpoint'}, reference_content='## Analysis of CVE-2024-10361 Content\\n\\nThe provided content relates to a commit in the LibreChat repository addressing avatar handling for agents and assistants. It appears to fix a vulnerability where the avatar metadata was being parsed from the request body instead of being fetched from the agent/assistant object.\\n\\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\\n\\nThe code was parsing avatar metadata directly from the request body, which is insecure and could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the avatar data.\\n\\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\\n\\n*   **Insecure Deserialization:** Parsing data directly from the request body without proper validation can lead to insecure deserialization vulnerabilities.\\n*   **Potential for Arbitrary File Upload/Modification:** If the parsed metadata contained file paths or other sensitive information, it could potentially be exploited to upload or modify files on the server.\\n\\n**Impact of exploitation:**\\n\\nThe impact of exploitation is not explicitly stated, but it could potentially lead to:\\n\\n*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker could potentially upload malicious files to the server.\\n*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive information about the agent or assistant.\\n*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker could potentially cause a denial of service by uploading a large or malicious file.\\n\\n**Attack vectors:**\\n\\n*   An attacker could send a crafted request with malicious avatar metadata in the request body.\\n\\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\\n\\n*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the `/avatar/:agent_id` or `/avatar/:assistant_id` endpoints.\\n\\n**Mitigation or fix:**\\n\\nThe commit fixes the vulnerability by:\\n\\n*   Removing the parsing of avatar metadata from the request body.\\n*   Fetching the avatar data from the agent/assistant object using the agent/assistant ID.\\n*   Updating the deleteFileByFilter function to include the user ID when deleting the old avatar file.\\n*   Updating error logging to provide more informative messages.\\n\\n**More detail than official CVE description:**\\n\\nYes, the content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It includes specific code changes, the root cause of the vulnerability, and the mitigation steps taken to fix it. It also details the specific files modified and the lines of code changed.', similar_info={'cwe_distribution': {}, 'cwe_consensus': '', 'similarity_stats': {'thresholds': [],

    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    An **arbitrary file deletion** vulnerability exists in danny-avila/librechat version v0.7.5-rc2, specifically within the /api/files endpoint. This vulnerability arises from **improper input validation**, allowing **path traversal** techniques to delete arbitrary files on the server. Attackers can exploit this to bypass security mechanisms and delete files outside the intended directory, including critical system files, user data, or application resources. This vulnerability impacts the integrity and availability of the system.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'improper input validation'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
