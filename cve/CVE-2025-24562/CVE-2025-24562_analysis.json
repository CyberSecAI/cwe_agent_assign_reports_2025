This is categorized as Broken Access Control (OWASP Top 10 A1).\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nA malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions. The specific impact varies case by case.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nCross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nUnauthenticated.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\nUpdate to version 4.2.2 or later. Patchstack users can enable auto-updates for vulnerable plugins.\n\n**Additional details (more than official CVE description):**\n- CVSS score: 7.1 (Low severity)\n- Vulnerable versions: <= 4.1.6\n- Fixed in version: 4.2.2\n- Reported by: SOPROBRO\n- Published by Patchstack: 24 January 2025\n- PSID: e16c0b26dcab",

The vulnerability also involves CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')), as the CSRF can lead to stored XSS. CWE-352 can precede CWE-79 in an attack chain. Both are distinct weaknesses that occur together in this vulnerability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe352[\"CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\"]\n    cwe79[\"CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\"]\n\n    cwe352 -- CANPRECEDE --> cwe79\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe352 primary\n    class cwe79 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** (CWE-352) allowing an attacker to force a privileged user to perform actions. This action leads to **Stored XSS** (CWE-79), where the injected script is stored on the server and executed when other users view the content. The initial root cause is the **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary classification is CWE-352 due to the **Cross-Site Request Forgery** being the root cause of the vulnerability, as stated in the \"**Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**\" and \"**CVE Reference Links Content Summary**\". The secondary classification is CWE-79, which is the resulting **Stored XSS** from the CSRF. This is also supported in the \"**Vulnerability Description Key Phrases**\".\n\nThe retriever results showed both CWE-79 and CWE-352 as top candidates. CWE-352 is a compound weakness, but it directly reflects the **Cross-Site Request Forgery** nature of the vulnerability, while CWE-79 reflects the resulting **Stored XSS**. The relationships show that CWE-352 can precede CWE-79 which correctly explains the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n**Abstraction Level**: Compound\n**Similarity Score**: 0.74\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This is a well-known Composite of multiple weaknesses that must all occur simultaneously, although it is attack-oriented in nature.\n\n\n\n## CWE-80: Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)\n**Abstraction Level**: Variant\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as \"<\", \">\", and \"&\" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Variant level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not sufficiently verify inputs that are assumed to be immutable but are actually externally controllable, such as hidden form fields.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
