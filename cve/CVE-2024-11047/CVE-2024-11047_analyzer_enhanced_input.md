## Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability was found in D-Link DI-8003 16.07.16A1. It has been declared as critical. Affected by this vulnerability is the function upgrade_filter_asp of the file /upgrade_filter.asp. The manipulation of the argument path leads to **stack-based buffer overflow**. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

### Vulnerability Description Key Phrases
- **weakness:** **stack-based buffer overflow**
- **vector:** manipulation of argument path
- **product:** D-Link DI-8003
- **version:** 16.07.16A1
- **component:** upgrade_filter_asp in /upgrade_filter.asp

## CVE Reference Links Content Summary
Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. This occurs due to the use of the `strcpy` function without proper bounds checking when handling user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The code uses `strcpy` to copy data from a user-controlled `path` parameter into a fixed-size buffer on the stack. If the `path` parameter is larger than the buffer, it overwrites adjacent memory on the stack, potentially allowing for control of the program's execution flow.
*   **Unvalidated Input:** The application doesn't properly validate the size of the user-supplied `path` parameter before copying it into a buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could lead to arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable device. An attacker could overwrite the return address on the stack, redirecting execution to attacker-controlled code.
*   **Device Control:** This could allow an attacker to gain complete control of the affected D-Link device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the `/upgrade_filter.asp` endpoint.
*   **`path` Parameter:** The attacker injects a long string into the `path` parameter of the HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable D-Link device.
*   **Understanding of the Attack Surface:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable endpoint (`/upgrade_filter.asp`) and the parameter (`path`).

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided text shows that the `strcpy` is used to copy the `path` parameter.
*   The vulnerable code is likely in the `upgrade_filter.asp` script, where parameters `v10` and `v11` are used to copy into buffer `v15`.
*   The size of `v15` is 512 bytes.
*   The `opt` parameter needs to contain `get` or `set` to reach the vulnerable `strcpy` call.
