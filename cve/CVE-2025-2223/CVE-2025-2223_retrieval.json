CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 213.82)\n\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value. This occurs when an integer value is\n         incremented to a value that is too large to st...\n\n### 3. CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (Score: 213.04)\n\nThe product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it reads from or writes to a memory location outside the buffer's intended boundary. This may result in read or write operations on unexpected memory locations that could be linked to other variables, data structures, or internal program data....\n\n### 4. CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions (Score: 68.32)\n\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product....\n\n### 5. CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write (Score: 67.42)\n\nThe product writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer....\n\n## IMPACT: 'Integrity'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this IMPACT:\n\n### 1. CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input (Score: 231.47)\n\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties....\n\n### 2.

CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature (Score: 212.76)\n\nThe product does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data....\n\n### 4. CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions (Score: 68.32)\n\nThe product does not check or incorrectly checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that are not expected to occur frequently during day to day operation of the product....\n\n### 5. CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition (Score: 67.81)\n\nThe product checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the product to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state....\n\n## VECTOR: 'malicious project file'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this VECTOR:\n\n### 1. CWE-1285: Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input (Score: 231.47)\n\nThe product receives input that is expected to specify an index, position, or offset into an indexable resource such as a buffer or file, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the specified index/position/offset has the required properties....\n\n### 2. CWE-20: Improper Input Validation (Score: 225.26)\n\nThe product receives input or data, but it does\n        not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the\n        properties that are required to process the data safely and\n        correctly....\n\n### 3. CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (Score: 213.82)\n\nThe product performs a calculation that can\n         produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic\n         assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than\n         the original value.
