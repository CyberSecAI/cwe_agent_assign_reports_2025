  "description": "API Platform Core is a system to create hypermedia-driven REST and GraphQL APIs. Starting in version 3.3.8, a security check that gets called after GraphQl resolvers is always replaced by another one as theres no break in a clause. As this falls back to `security`, the impact is there only when theres only a security after resolver and none inside security. Version 3.3.15 contains a patch for the issue.",

  "reference_content": "CVE-2025-23204\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nA security check that gets called after GraphQL resolvers is always replaced by another one because there's no `break` statement in the relevant code block.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\nLogic error in the `AccessCheckerProvider.php` file, specifically within the `provide` method. The lack of a `break` statement causes the security check to fall back to a default security check even when it shouldn't.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nThe impact is limited to scenarios where only a security after resolver is defined and no security check is present within the security logic itself.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nExploitation involves crafting a GraphQL request that triggers the security after resolver.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\nAn attacker needs to be able to send GraphQL requests to the application.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe fix involves adding a `break` statement after the `securityAfterResolver` check in the `AccessCheckerProvider.php` file. This ensures that the correct security check is executed.  The pull request #6444 implements this fix.",

The **incorrect order** of operations results in **incorrect authorization**. |\n\n## Evidence and Confidence\n\n*   **Confidence Score:** 0.80\n*   **Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM\n\n## Relationship Analysis\nThe primary relationship that influenced the selection was that the **incorrect order** of security checks directly leads to an **authorization bypass**. CWE-696 (Incorrect Behavior Order) is the root cause, while CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) is a consequence of the misordering. The abstraction level is Class for both, and while a more specific Base CWE could be ideal, the available information strongly supports these Class-level mappings.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe696[\"CWE-696: Incorrect Behavior Order\"]\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CAUSED_BY| cwe696\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    \n    class cwe696 primary\n    class cwe863 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **incorrect order** of security checks (CWE-696), which then directly leads to **incorrect authorization** (CWE-863), resulting in a potential security bypass.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe initial assessment focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The description clearly states that the **security check gets called after GraphQL resolvers is always replaced** due to a missing `break` statement. This points to an **incorrect order** of operations, making CWE-696 (Incorrect Behavior Order) the primary candidate.\n\nCWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) was considered as a secondary CWE because the **incorrect order** ultimately leads to **incorrect authorization**, which is the end result of the vulnerability.\n\nThe evidence provided is sufficient to justify the selection of these CWEs, although more detailed information about the specific code implementation could potentially lead to a more precise Base-level CWE. The graph relationships confirm that the **incorrect order** directly contributes to **incorrect authorization**, reinforcing the chosen classifications.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at an appropriate level of specificity given the available information.
