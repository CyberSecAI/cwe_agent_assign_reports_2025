## Query
In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved net stmmac fix TSO DMA API usage causing oops Commit 66600fac7a98 (net stmmac TSO Fix unbalanced DMA map/unmap for non-paged SKB data) moved the assignment of tx_skbuff_dma[]s members to be later in stmmac_tso_xmit(). The buf (dma cookie) and len stored in this structure are passed to dma_unmap_single() by stmmac_tx_clean(). The DMA API requires that the dma cookie passed to dma_unmap_single() is the same as the value returned from dma_map_single(). However, by moving the assignment later, this is not the case when priv->dma_cap.addr64 > 32 as des is offset by proto_hdr_len. This causes problems such as dwc-eth-dwmac 2490000.ethernet eth0 Tx DMA map failed and with DMA_API_DEBUG enabled DMA-API dwc-eth-dwmac 2490000.ethernet device driver tries to +free DMA memory it has not allocated [device address=0x000000ffffcf65c0] [size=66 bytes] Fix this by maintaining des as the original DMA cookie, and use tso_des to pass the offset DMA cookie to stmmac_tso_allocator().
