  "description": "Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. In affected versions **missing validation** in `ApRequestService.signedGet` and `HttpRequestService.getActivityJson` allows an attacker to create fake user profiles and forged notes. The spoofed users will appear to be from a different instance than the one where they actually exist, and the forged notes will appear to be posted by a different user. Vulnerable Misskey instances will accept the spoofed objects as valid, allowing an attacker to impersonate other users and instances. The attacker retains full control of the spoofed user / note and can interact like a real account. This issue has been addressed in version 2024.11.0-alpha.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

This enables impersonation, allowing the attacker to interact with the system as a fake user and post fabricated notes. The compromised Misskey instance will treat these spoofed objects as legitimate.\n- **Attack vectors:** Network based attack, involving the manipulation of data via the API endpoints `ApRequestService.signedGet` and `HttpRequestService.getActivityJson`.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No specific privileges, user interaction, or special deployment/execution conditions are required. The attacker only needs to send malicious requests over the network.",

CWE-20 is a general **Improper Input Validation** weakness, while more specific variants exist. Given the information, it's impossible to pinpoint the exact input validation error. The other important relationship is that authentication bypass can often be a consequence of improper input validation when attacker-controlled data is used in authentication decisions.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    cwe290[\"CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\"]\n    \n    cwe290 -->|CANFOLLOW| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe20 primary\n    class cwe290 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **missing validation** of input within `ApRequestService.signedGet` and `HttpRequestService.getActivityJson`. This **missing validation** allows attackers to create fake user profiles and forge notes, leading to the ability to spoof users and instances, ultimately resulting in authentication bypass and impersonation.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe analysis identifies **Improper Input Validation** (CWE-20) as the primary weakness, as the vulnerability stems directly from the **missing validation** in the specified components. This leads to the ability to create spoofed user profiles and forged notes. The ability to spoof users could be classified as Authentication Bypass by Spoofing (CWE-290), but this is a consequence of the **missing validation**, not the root cause.\n\nThe evidence for **missing validation** is strong, as it is explicitly stated in the vulnerability description: \"missing validation in `ApRequestService.signedGet` and `HttpRequestService.getActivityJson` allows an attacker to create fake user profiles and forged notes.\"\n\nThe retriever results also point to authentication bypass related CWEs, but these are a result of the initial input validation issue.\n\nCWE-20 is chosen as the primary CWE because it represents the fundamental coding error that allows the vulnerability to occur. It is at the Base level of abstraction, which is preferred.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nA capture-replay flaw exists when the design of the product makes it possible for a malicious user to sniff network traffic and bypass authentication by replaying it to the server in question to the same effect as the original message (or with minor changes).\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThis attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-1391: Use of Weak Credentials\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses weak credentials (such as a default key or hard-coded password) that can be calculated, derived, reused, or guessed by an attacker.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-451: User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.68\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe user interface (UI) does not properly represent critical information to the user, allowing the information - or its source - to be obscured or spoofed.
