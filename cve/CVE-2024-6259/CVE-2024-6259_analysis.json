CWE-125 and CWE-787 are related as potential consequences of this improper handling. CWE-130 can precede CWE-805 (Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value), which can lead to out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) or write (CWE-787) operations. The selection of CWE-130 as the primary weakness reflects the root cause, while CWE-125 and CWE-787 represents the potential impacts.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe130[\"CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\"]\n    cwe805[\"CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value\"]\n    cwe125[\"CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read\"]\n    cwe787[\"CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write\"]\n\n    cwe130 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe805\n    cwe805 --> cwe125\n    cwe805 --> cwe787\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe130 primary\n    class cwe125,cwe787 secondary\n    class cwe805 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with the **improper discarding** of data in `bt_hci_le_adv_ext_report`, which leads to **improper handling** of the buffer length (CWE-130). This results in the `net_buf_pull` function being used without sufficient data remaining, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) or, more likely in this case due to `net_buf_pull`, an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) and finally to a heap overflow causing a crash or denial of service.\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe primary weakness is CWE-130, as the vulnerability stems from **improper handling** of the length parameter during buffer processing. The \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary\" section specifically mentions \"Improper handling of buffer length.\" The description notes that the `net_buf_pull` function is called without validating if enough data remains, supporting CWE-130. The direct consequence of this **improper handling** is likely to be an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787), leading to a heap overflow. While an out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) is possible, the use of `net_buf_pull` makes a write more probable.\n\nCWE-617 (Reachable Assertion) was considered due to its presence in the retriever results, but it doesn't align directly with the provided vulnerability description. CWE-805 (Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value) is a close candidate, but CWE-130 seems to represent the root cause more accurately. The provided evidence focuses on length parameter inconsistency and not just incorrect length.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.72\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not correctly calculate the size to be used when allocating a buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.71\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product parses a formatted message or structure, but it does not handle or incorrectly handles a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product uses a function that accepts a format string as an argument, but the format string originates from an external source.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n## CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.70\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product does not handle or incorrectly handles an exceptional condition.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
