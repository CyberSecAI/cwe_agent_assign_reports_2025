It provides significantly more detail than a standard CVE description.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe `login.cgi` binary lacks authentication checks, and improperly handles user-supplied input in the `set_sys_init()` function when processing the `restart_hour_value`, `restart_min_value`, and `restart_week_value` POST parameters.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **CWE-77 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command (\u2018Command Injection\u2019):** The vulnerability allows for arbitrary command execution via crafted HTTP POST requests.\n*   Lack of input validation and sanitization in the `set_sys_init()` function.\n*   Missing authentication checks in the `login.cgi` binary.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the affected device.\n*   **System compromise:** Full system compromise is possible.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   **Unauthenticated HTTP request:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.\n*   Specifically crafted HTTP POST requests to `login.cgi` with manipulated `restart_hour_value`, `restart_min_value`, or `restart_week_value` parameters.\n*   The crafted parameters are ultimately used to construct a crontab entry, leading to command execution.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   Network access to the vulnerable device.\n*   Ability to send HTTP POST requests.\n*   Understanding of crontab syntax to craft a malicious payload.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\n\nThe report does not specify a fix, but implies that proper input validation and authentication checks within the `login.cgi` binary are necessary to mitigate the vulnerability. The vendor was contacted and is working on patches, but the product has been discontinued.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n*   **Affected Product:** Wavlink AC3000 M33A8.V5030.210505\n*   **CVSSv3 Score:** 10.0 (Critical)\n*   The vulnerability leverages the interaction between the `login.cgi` binary, the `sch_reboot.sh` script, and the system's crontab functionality.\n*   The report details the specific code locations and functions involved in the vulnerability.",

While CWE-77 is more general, the vulnerability description and CVE summary clearly specify that the command injection leads to OS command execution, making CWE-78 a more specific and appropriate choice.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe78[\"CWE-78: OS Command Injection\"]\n    cwe77[\"CWE-77: Command Injection\"]\n\n    cwe78 -->|CHILDOF| cwe77\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe78 primary\n    class cwe77 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with **improper neutralization** of input, leading to OS command injection and ultimately arbitrary code execution.\n\nImproper Input Handling -> OS Command Injection -> Arbitrary Code Execution\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial analysis focused on identifying the root cause of the vulnerability. The provided evidence, particularly the \"CVE Reference Links Content Summary,\" clearly indicates that the `login.cgi` binary **improperly handles user-supplied input** in the `set_sys_init()` function, leading to command injection. This aligns perfectly with the description of CWE-78, which involves **improper neutralization** of special elements used in an OS command. The description and summary evidence directly supports CWE-78 as the root cause. The relationship graph reinforced this decision by highlighting that CWE-78 is a specific type of command injection, making it the more accurate choice. The selection of CWE-78 is at the optimal level of specificity because the vulnerability results in OS command execution, not just a general command injection.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\n\n## CWE-790: Improper Filtering of Special Elements\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.79\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product receives data from an upstream component, but does not filter or incorrectly filters special elements before sending it to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed-with-Review\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate\n\n## CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe web application does not adequately enforce appropriate authorization on all restricted URLs, scripts, or files.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-303: Incorrect Implementation of Authentication Algorithm\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.78\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe requirements for the product dictate the use of an established authentication algorithm, but the implementation of the algorithm is incorrect.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Allowed\n- Rationale: This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.\n\n## CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-74 is high-level and often misused when lower-level weaknesses are more appropriate.\n\n## CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.77\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product prepares a structured message for communication with another component, but encoding or escaping of the data is either missing or done incorrectly.
