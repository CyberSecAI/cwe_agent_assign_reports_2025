  "reference_content": "CVE-2025-29315 is related to the content. Here's the extracted information:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe mismatch between Shiro\u2019s static RBAC and the dynamic nature of SFC resources. Specifically, coarse-grained URL-to-role mapping and a lack of context-aware authorization checks.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n*   Coarse-grained URL-to-role mapping in Shiro configuration.\n*   Lack of context-aware authorization checks (resource ownership, session state).\n*   Use of wildcard URL patterns (e.g., `/**`) expanding the attack surface.\n*   Static RBAC model.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n*   Privilege escalation: Low-privileged users can execute administrative actions.\n*   Data breach: Access to sensitive data within the SFC.\n*   Service interruption: Modification or deletion of critical SFC components.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n*   Crafting malicious HTTP requests (e.g., DELETE requests) to tamper with SFC configurations.\n*   Exploiting broadly permitted paths for roles to execute unintended operations.\n*   Exploiting lack of tenant-ID validation to access resources of other tenants.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n*   Low-privileged user account (e.g., role USER).\n*   Ability to send HTTP requests to the OpenDaylight controller.\n*   Knowledge of the SFC resource paths and Shiro configuration.\n\n**Mitigation or fix:**\nThe blog post does not explicitly state a fix, but implies the need for a more context-sensitive and fine-grained RBAC model that validates resource ownership and dynamic context.\n\n**Additional Details (more than official CVE description):**\nThe blog post provides detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including commands to check user accounts and roles, and examples of HTTP requests. It also highlights the specific OpenDaylight version (sodium-sr4) and OS (Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS) used for testing. The post also details the roles and permissions of different users within the system.",

This is a child of CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), which in turn is a child of CWE-284 (Improper Access Control). The vulnerability involves **incorrect** authorization checks within the Shiro-based RBAC mechanism, making CWE-863 more specific and appropriate than its parents. CWE-284 is a high-level categorization, which makes it less ideal. The relationship analysis indicates a clear hierarchical structure, with CWE-863 being the most specific and relevant to the vulnerability's root cause.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe863[\"CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization\"]\n    cwe285[\"CWE-285: Improper Authorization\"]\n    cwe284[\"CWE-284: Improper Access Control\"]\n    \n    cwe863 -->|CHILDOF| cwe285\n    cwe285 -->|CHILDOF| cwe284\n\n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    classDef tertiary fill:#9e9,stroke:#333\n    class cwe863 primary\n    class cwe285 secondary\n    class cwe284 tertiary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\n\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a **flawed RBAC implementation** in OpenDaylight SFC. This leads to **incorrect authorization checks**, allowing low-privileged users to execute privileged operations. This results in **privilege escalation**, potentially leading to **data breaches** and **service interruption**.\n\nFlawed RBAC Implementation -> Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863) -> Privilege Escalation -> Data Breach / Service Interruption\n\n## Summary of Analysis\n\nThe initial assessment and the retriever results point towards authorization-related CWEs. The vulnerability description and CVE reference summary clearly indicate an issue with authorization, specifically an **incorrect** implementation within the Shiro-based RBAC. The key phrase \"Shiro-based RBAC...allows attackers to execute privileged operations via a crafted request\" suggests that the system is attempting to perform authorization, but doing it incorrectly.\n\nThe evidence from the CVE Reference Links Content Summary supports this:\n*   \"Coarse-grained URL-to-role mapping in Shiro configuration\"\n*   \"Lack of context-aware authorization checks\"\n\nThese points directly relate to **incorrect authorization**, as the role mappings and checks are not adequately implemented. This solidifies the choice of CWE-863 as the primary CWE.\n\nCWE-285 (Improper Authorization) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) were considered but deemed less specific. CWE-285 is a more general authorization issue, while CWE-284 is a very high-level access control problem. Since the problem is an incorrect authorization implementation, CWE-863 is the most appropriate and specific choice.\n\nThe selected CWEs are at the optimal level of specificity. CWE-863 is a Class-level CWE, providing a good balance between specificity and generality. It accurately captures the nature of the vulnerability without being overly broad or narrow.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-668: Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere\n**Abstraction Level**: Class\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.\n\n**Mapping Guidance**:\n- Usage: Discouraged\n- Rationale: CWE-668 is high-level and is often misused as a catch-all when lower-level CWE IDs might be applicable. It is sometimes used for low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar). It is not useful for trend analysis.\n\n## CWE-41: Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.76\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product is vulnerable to file system contents disclosure through path equivalence.
