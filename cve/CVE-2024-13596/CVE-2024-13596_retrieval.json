    "enhanced_query": "# Vulnerability Description\n\n    The WordPress Survey & Poll Quiz, Survey and Poll Plugin for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the id attribute of the survey shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.5 due to **insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query**. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.\n\n    # Keyphrase-Specific CWE Analysis\n    This vulnerability contains multiple keyphrases that may map to different CWEs. \n    Please analyze each keyphrase separately and determine the most appropriate CWE(s) for each.\n\n    ## ROOTCAUSE: 'insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query'\n\nRelevant CWEs for this ROOTCAUSE:\n\n### 1.
