Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server.

While other CWEs like CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) could be related, the description strongly points to resource consumption as the core issue.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    cwe400[\"CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption\"]\n    cwe20[\"CWE-20: Improper Input Validation\"]\n    \n    cwe400 -->|CANPRECEDE| cwe20\n    \n    classDef primary fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    classDef secondary fill:#69f,stroke:#333\n    class cwe400 primary\n    class cwe20 secondary\n```\n\n## Vulnerability Chain\nThe vulnerability chain starts with a potentially uncontrolled resource consumption (**ROOTCAUSE**), leading to a hang or crash, and culminating in a complete denial of service.\n  - **CWE-400** (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) -> Hang/Crash -> Denial of Service\n\n## Summary of Analysis\nThe assessment is primarily based on the vulnerability description, which explicitly mentions the ability to cause a hang or repeatable crash, leading to a complete denial of service. This strongly suggests uncontrolled resource consumption.\n\nThe description states: \"Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server.\" This directly aligns with the impact described in CWE-400.\n\nBased on the evidence provided, CWE-400 is at the optimal level of specificity, as it accurately captures the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\nRelevant CWE Information:\n\n# Enhanced Context (25 CWEs)\nThe following CWEs were identified as potentially relevant to this vulnerability:\n\n## CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')\n**Abstraction Level**: Base\n**Similarity Score**: 0.69\n**Source**: dense\n\n**Description**:\nThe product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.
